    "### Using Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks to label posts in test set\n",
    "\n",
    "Having gathered the posts by scraping, a sample of 1000 posts were labelled manually so as to train models to subsequently predict labels on the remainder of the dataset (around 9000 posts). *Textblob and VADER (unsupervised learning text classification models) were initially used to predict the sentiment of the posts, but the results were not accurate*\n",
    "\n",
    "The labels are: \n",
    "- **0 for negative sentiment** \n",
    "- **1 for neutral sentiment**\n",
    "- **2 for positive sentiment**\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that the labels were highly skewed, with around 80% of the posts classed as neutral, 15% as negative and 5% positive. This affected how well the model was able to predict the sentiment of unlabelled posts. \n",
    "\n",
    "The models chosen were classification models - Logistic Regression and Multinomial Naive Bayes, Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Net model and BERT. \n",
    "\n",
    "Link to google collab notebook for BERT model: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/14-Yo8eGbbyCpOGRyszqK1iJIjCFybNnu?usp=sharing\n",
    "\n",
    "It was found that the Multinomial Naive Bayes model was the most accurate in predicting sentiment. It had high Accuracy, ROC AUC and F1 scores, with little variance between the train and validation sets, as well as being more likely to assign minority classes, compared to the Logistic Regression Model. The performance of LSTM RNN and BERT models paled in comparison as well. For BERT, it could be that the pretrained model did not generalise well on the dataset, due to the nature of the local Singlish language (in terms of different words and sentence structures). The LSTM RNN model also did not do well, as it relied on learning words before and after a significant word, instead of standalone words, which did not work particularly well for this dataset.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that methods such as SMOTE, random oversampling and manipulating class weights were used to try to address the issue of unbalanced classes in the data, all of which did not perform as well as a model where the minority classes were not oversampled/given more weightage in the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "The process of assessing a production model for sentiment analysis is as follows:\n",
    "1. **Train Multinomial NB model on all posts in train set, which have labelled sentiments (THIS NOTEBOOK)** \n",
    "2. **Predict label on posts in test set (THIS NOTEBOOK)** \n",
    "3. Check accuracy of predictions and make changes to incorrect labels \n",
    "4. Collate labelled posts in train and test sets to train final production model \n",
    "\n",
    "While I acknowledge that it is not ideal to use a regular supervised learning classification models to predict the sentiment of text posts, this was the best method for this particular dataset. I believe that with more data gathered, a LSTM RNN or BERT model can be sufficiently trained to better predict sentiment of posts from Singaporean forums.  "
