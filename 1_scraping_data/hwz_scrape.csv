"National Development Minister Lawrence Wong conceded that the safeguards against COVID-19 in foreign worker dormitories were ¬ìnot sufficient¬î, according to a CNBC report on Wednesday (6 May), in the frankest admission yet by a Singapore leader that the government dropped the ball on the issue.In an interview with CNBC¬ís Squawk Box Asia, the co-chair of the multi-ministry taskforce on the coronavirus was asked by anchor Sri Jegarajah why the government had failed to identify these dorms, which house some 400,000 men across Singapore, as a potential area of infection risk.Wong responded by pointing out that the foreign worker clusters have occurred not just in the dormitories, but also in common work sites and gathering areas.Jegarajah then pressed Wong, ¬ìBut do you accept that conditions in those foreign worker dormitories were frankly appalling, frankly unhygienic, and this was an accident waiting to happen from a public health point of view?

I agree that we were honestly doing quite well in handling the outbreak prior to the explosion in the dorms, with imported cases from returning Singaporeans and residents being taken care of and achieving a high discharge rate.While I agree it is not easy especially the need to balance workers well-being with employer¬ís cost, it is squarely the responsibility of her ministry to find a balance equation.

"On Thursday (Apr. 9), the Ministry of Health (MOH) announced 287 new Covid-19 cases.This brings the total number of cases in Singapore to 1,910.Of the new cases today, over 200 are related to foreign workers residing in dormitories.Links between seven clustersSpeaking at a press conference on Apr. 9, MOH's Director of Medical Science, Kenneth Mak, revealed that contact tracing efforts have established links between these seven clusters:Mustafa CentreProject Glory Construction SiteS11 Dormitory @ PunggolTampines DormitoryToh Guan DormitorySungei Tengah LodgeCochrane Lodge IIAs of Apr. 8, the total number of cases in these clusters, excluding the ones from Mustafa, is 224.Started with Mustafa clusterMak explained that the cases began with the Mustafa cluster after a number of employees in the mall tested positive for Covid-19.""We believe that the (foreign) workers had visited Mustafa, and they subsequently transmitted the infection to their co-workers, either at the Project Glory construction site or to other residents within the dormitories that they lived in,"" said Mak.It is believed that the transmissions most likely occurred through close contact, such as during mealtimes or the physical proximity of workers at the construction site.They then subsequently transmitted the virus to friends and colleagues within their dormitories through social activities.Continued to work despite having mild symptomsNational Development Minister Lawrence Wong added that many of the workers had very mild symptoms and thus, they continued to work.He stated:""That's why there was a delay in picking them up. So it's very likely that the virus spread had been going around for some time in the dormitories, and we are now seeing all the indicators of it.""He said that Singapore is currently dealing with two separate infections ¬ó within the foreign worker dormitories, where the numbers are rising sharply, and within the general population, where the numbers are more stable now.MOH working with MOM, SPF, MINDEF and SAFWith regard to the dormitory clusters, MOH has been working very closely with the joint task force that's led by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the Singapore Police Force (SPF), Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).MOH has set-up medical posts in the dormitories where medical personnel can look after workers as they present with symptoms.In addition, MOH is also performing an active case finding to look for workers who are not well and bring them down for further assessment if necessary.When symptomatic workers are identified, they would be immediately isolated and prevented from mixing with other workers in the dormitory.If they test positive for Covid-19, they will be treated at a hospital or community isolation facility.Those who are not tested positive but remain symptomatic they will be kept separated so as to prevent any infection from spreading to other workers in the dormitory.https://mothership.sg/2020/04/covid-...-mustafa-link/","09-04-2020, 09:03 PM", 5 foreign worker dormitory clusters might have stemmed from Mustafa Centre cluster
"Cruise ships are being assessed for their feasibility as temporary housing for foreign workers who are recovered from Covid-19 and tested negative for the virus.SuperStar Gemini and SuperStar Aquarius, mid-sized cruise ships operated by Genting Cruise Lines, will be checked for consideration by the Government for factors such as ventilation systems, security protocols and infection control measures.If deemed feasible, the two cruise ships may be used to complement other interim facilities such as Singapore Armed Forces military camps and vacant Housing Board blocks that have been refurbished to house healthy workers.By reducing numbers of workers in existing dormitories, health measures can be implemented more effectively, said the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in a media statement on Friday (April 17) morning.Cruise ships are being considered for use as temporary housing as they have readily available rooms and en-suite toilets to minimise person-to-person contact, added STB.SuperStar Gemini, which arrived from Hong Kong on Friday, is berthed at Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore. SuperStar Aquarius may be activated for assessment at a later date.If deemed suitable, the two ships may accommodate up to 2,000 foreign workers in total.STB said that ""if activated, every effort will be made to uphold the health, welfare and security of foreign workers on board the ship, where they will be expected to observe the highest standards of safe distancing at all times"".Foreign workers would also be allowed scheduled outdoor time on the vessels and would be provided with wireless Internet access.While the spread of the coronavirus in the wider community has held steady over the past two weeks, the number of cases linked to foreign workers in dormitories has risen exponentially.As of Friday morning, the total number of foreign workers linked to dorms who have tested positive for Covid-19 is 2,689, which is about 60 per cent of all Singapore's cases.There are now a total of 12 dormitories declared as isolation areas where workers at these lodgings must be quarantined in their rooms for 14 days.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ealthy-foreign","17-04-2020, 12:21 PM", Cruise ships Gemini & Aquarius assessed for feasibility to temporarily house healthy foreign workers

"Foreign workers‚Äô cramp living conditions very ideal for spread of COVID-19; So why no preparation for an outbreak?Activists such as Jolovan Wham have long criticised Singapore for the way it treats its foreign workers. It would probably be fair to say that they live in tight cramp quarters with low pay and no rights to citizenship even as they build the infrastructure in which we rely on.Even Professor Tommy Koh, Singapore‚Äôs Ambassador-at-Large commented that foreign workers are treated in a Third World manner.‚Äú‚Ä¶The government has allowed their employers to transport them in flat bed trucks with no seats. They stay in overcrowded dormitories and are packed likes sardines with 12 persons to a room. The dormitories are not clean or sanitary. The dormitories were like a time bomb waiting to explode. They have now exploded with many infected workers. Singapore should treat this as a wake up call to treat our indispensable foreign workers like a First World country should and not in the disgraceful way in which they are treated now..Given their housing arrangements, it comes as no surprise that the dreaded COVID-19 has reared its ugly head in these foreign worker dormitories.As of yesterday, 6 of the reported COVID-19 clusters are foreign workers dormitories and three that are construction sites.Bloomberg reports that:‚ÄúSingapore reported its highest daily increase of coronavirus cases on Sunday, as infections rose among foreign workers housed in massive dormitories‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.In particular, two previously reported clusters, involving dorms for foreign workers, saw a jump in the number of cases. These two dorms have now been declared ‚Äúisolation areas‚Äù and any individuals residing there will have to stay in their rooms for 14 days to avoid the spread of the virus, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo. Almost 20,000 people live in the two dorms.‚ÄùCountries the world over have asked its citizens to go into lock down in their own home to reduce the spread of the virus.But how are foreign workers who live so closely together in their dormitories ever to go into lock down or isolation properly? Even if they were to isolate themselves from the public, they still have to share their room with 10-20 other room mates.With people living so closely together, its conditions are pretty much ideal for the spread of the virus!Should Singapore not have done something earlier about this? It is after all not rocket science that the dormitories would be sitting ducks for the corona virus spread?Besides, cases having foreign workers being infected with COVID-19 are not new. There have been reports of the virus spreading in foreign workers‚Äô accommodation as early as 10 February this year.Almost two whole months ago!Why didn‚Äôt the government act then? Why has the government not thought of measures to spread the foriegn workers out or find alternative housing in an event of a outbreak within a dormitory?Now, the workers in the two largest cluster of COVID-19 infection ‚Äî S11 Dormitory @ Punggol (63 cases) and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory (28 cases) ‚Äî are being isolated within the dormitories itself.This reeks of a potential repeat of the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship where the Japanese government is being accused of failing to isolate the crew of the Diamond Princess from the beginning of the quarantine, he said infected workers may have passed on ‚Äúsecondary or tertiary‚Äù infections to their fellow crew members and passengers, thereby exacerbating the deadly outbreak. At least 705 people contracted the virus during the quarantine, four of whom have died.Now word has it that the government is scrambling to refurnish housings to house these foreign workers for quarantine. But the government has had ample time to react but has seemingly done little or nothing? Why?Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo has said that the ‚Äúkey objective is to ensure the health and well-being of everyone, not just of our own people but also foreign workers helping our economy‚Ä¶ We want to give foreign workers the assurance that the measures we take are in their interest as well as their well-being.‚ÄùWhile the statement sends a strong feeling of intent, questions still remain as to whether this is a case of too little too late? If we genuinely cared about the welfare of our foreign workers, why wait till now to take action?We already know they live in close quarters. We already know that the virus tends to spread through close contact. Surely, it is a question of common sense to have done something about this earlier?Now that the virus has already begun to spread in the living quarters of the workers, it may well be too late to effectively stem the tide.Singapore prides itself as an efficient country. In view of this reputation of efficiency, it might be harder to believe that the government did not have an inkling that foreign workers would be susceptible to the outbreak and make preparation for it.https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/202...embccoCJMmHBGc","06-04-2020, 11:47 AM", Foreign workers¬í cramp living conditions very ideal for spread of COVID-19

My son is three years old. I‚Äôm just concerned. Even though they house healthy foreign workers here, we will never know right?‚Äù said the 32-year-old, who works in the food and beverage sector.An elderly resident who gave his name as Mr Woo said he would have a peace of mind if there could be a way of guaranteeing that the foreign workers housed at Redhill Close are free from Covid-19. An example could be medical proof from the Singapore General Hospital, suggested the 82-year-old retiree.‚ÄúI‚Äôm not saying they have the disease. But if the Government can provide proof that they went through some health checks, there would be some peace of mind,‚Äù he said.TODAY has sent queries to the Manpower Ministry.","09-04-2020, 01:20 PM", 'Healthy' foreign workers being moved from domitories to REDHILL CLOSE - Potential next cluster?

"Good reporting by TODAY - https://www.todayonline.com/singapor...-redhill-close-----The workers told this reporter that they moved in on Tuesday from Acacia Lodge at Bukit Batok and would have to be isolated for two weeks.During these two weeks, they would not be able to leave the cordoned area but food would be delivered to them three times a day.When asked what kind of food they have received, two foreign workers said it was ¬ìChinese food¬î. Their meals contained rice, chicken and fruit, and they seemed satisfied with it.When asked whether the toilets were clean, the workers replied in the affirmative.The workers also seemed generally satisfied with their living conditions, saying all is ¬ìokay¬î...However, Singapore residents living around Redhill Close were a little concerned with the prospect of a large group of foreign workers living near them.Ms Jenny Mak, 52, pointed out that the estate has a relatively large elderly population, who might be more vulnerable to getting serious complications from Covid-19 infection.Ms Melissa Azmi, another resident in the estate, echoed similar sentiments, adding that she would have no issue if the foreign workers were kept behind the barricades.¬ìI have my grandfather at home and my mother. My son is three years old. I¬ím just concerned. Even though they house healthy foreign workers here, we will never know right?¬î said the 32-year-old, who works in the food and beverage sector.An elderly resident who gave his name as Mr Woo said he would have a peace of mind if there could be a way of guaranteeing that the foreign workers housed at Redhill Close are free from Covid-19. An example could be medical proof from the Singapore General Hospital, suggested the 82-year-old retiree.¬ìI¬ím not saying they have the disease. But if the Government can provide proof that they went through some health checks, there would be some peace of mind,¬î he said.TODAY has sent queries to the Manpower Ministry.Read more at https://www.todayonline.com/singapor...-redhill-close","09-04-2020, 11:08 PM", 'Healthy' foreign workers being moved from domitories to REDHILL CLOSE - Potential next cluster?

"In a Facebook post on Apr. 13, co-chair of the Multi-Ministry TaskForce for Covid-19 Lawrence Wong gave an update on the Covid-19 situation in Singapore.Wong shared three charts detailing the three types of infected cases in Singapore:Imported casesCommunity casesWork permit and dormitory casesThe charts document the number of cases in each category up to Apr. 11.Wong mentioned that the number of community cases increased with the wave of imported cases, but the numbers have seen ""some moderation in recent days"".Wong attributes this to the safe distancing measures that have been put in place.However, he noted that the number of cases related to work permit holders and dormitories have increased sharply, and will likely continue to do so as Singapore undertakes ""more aggressive testing"" of workers staying in the dormitories.He reiterated that Singapore has a ""comprehensive strategy"" to take care of foreign workers in the dormitories, and assured the public that the government is ""going all out to tackle this"" though it will take some time for the effects of the circuit-breaker measures to show.""We will only see the full effects of the circuit breaker in the next one to two weeks. So let's press on with our efforts to stay home, minimise contact with others, and break the transmission chain in our community,"" Wong wrote.233 new cases on Apr. 12On Apr. 12, MOH reported an additional 233 Covid-19 cases in Singapore.51 are linked to known clusters, while 15 are linked to other cases.167 cases are pending contact tracing. Of these 167 cases, 16 are Singapore Citizens and Permanent Residents while 10 are Work Pass or Long Term Pass holders residing in our community.141 are Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, work sites and other living quarters.https://mothership.sg/2020/04/covid-...s-dormitories/","13-04-2020, 12:46 PM", Covid-19 cases in dormitories likely to increase because of 'more aggressive testing': Lawrence Wong

"This is my take and analysis on the current situation. The measures we have implemented seem to be working, local cases (outside of foreign workers, worker dormitories and living quarters) are going down. We can confirm that home space/living density is one of the key contributory factors for the spread of COVID-19 despite heat/humidity being a key deterrent. The Singapore government should start to do the same segmentation procedures to test, separate, space out and relocate all foreign workers if necessary for all remaining foreign dormitories and living quarters which are not isolated currently. This needs to be done now, proactively and aggressively. Singapore‚Äôs problem is unique due to our high dependence and reliance on foreign workers. In order to resolve the issue of the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore, stopping the spread of this virus in the foreign quarter dormitories and living quarters is the paramount key. I hope the authorities have already realise this and are putting in place, proactive and aggressive measures to stop COVID-19 from spreading amongst all cramped quarters in Singapore. We solve this, we will solve 90% of the COVID-19 cases and the spread of in Singapore. If we fail to do so, there is a high chance that the virus will reactivate it again for a third wave even if there is a drop of COVID-19 cases initially and the next few weeks. We have to remember that it is likely that the virus could have been circulating in the foreign dormitories as early as February, reaching the stage it has today.","13-04-2020, 12:48 PM", Covid-19 cases in dormitories likely to increase because of 'more aggressive testing': Lawrence Wong

"Simply said, out of the 200+ cases reported daily.I think probably less than a quarter are sinkies and are mostly linked.Rest are mostly dorms.

There were dorm cases long ago, their contact tracing were doing what?The biggest cluster of people staying together are the dorms, they did practically nothing to reduce their risk.

"Some foreign workers who have recovered from COVID-19 in Singapore will be temporarily housed on two SuperStar cruise ships, Genting Cruise Lines said on Friday (May 1).SuperStar Gemini and SuperStar Aquarius have ""completed stringent evaluation checks"" by the Government and will provide accommodation for the workers, it said in a press release.The number of COVID-19 cases among migrant workers living in dormitories has surged in recent weeks, and now make up about 85 per cent of Singapore's 16,169 cases.Many workers who are well have been moved out of the tightly packed dormitories to other living quarters, such as military camps and vacant HDB flats.On Apr 27, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said that authorities have an ""extensive"" plan to house recovered foreign migrant workers, involving new sites.Earlier, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) had said that the two cruise ships were being assessed as they have readily available rooms and en-suite toilets to minimise person-to-person contact.The assessment considered factors such as the ship‚Äôs ventilation systems, security protocols and infection control measures, said STB. The two ships together can accommodate up to 2,000 foreign workers.""Every effort will be made to uphold the health and welfare of Singapore‚Äôs foreign workers while on board the ship, which include observing the highest standards of safe distancing and preventive measures at all timess,"" said Genting Cruise Lines.‚ÄúWe are pleased that our on board facilities, as well as preventive and safety standards meet Singapore‚Äôs strict requirements for this initiative,"" said Mr Michael Goh, president of Dream Cruises, adding that there have been no reported cases of COVID-19 among its guests or crew to date.The SuperStar Gemini arrived on Apr 17 from Hong Kong, and is berthed at Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore.

"Singapore is looking ahead to a ‚Äúrecovery phase‚Äù for foreign workers currently isolated in dormitories to allow them to resume working safely, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said on Sunday (May 10).These workers, some of whom have recovered from Covid-19, will be able to return to work as various businesses eventually resume operations. This involves getting the workers tested to ensure they have properly recovered, and to continue monitoring their health, she said.The new system will involve the distribution of medical technology ‚Äî including 20,000 pulse oximeters ‚Äî to worker dormitories and other places they reside in, Mrs Teo added. A pulse oximeter gives an early warning of deteriorating health by measuring the level of oxygen in the blood.Conducting tele-medical consultations will also be used for foreign workers using tele-kiosks at dormitories or via mobile phones. Since April 25, about 400 consultations between doctors and foreign workers have taken place via phones, the Ministry of Manpower stated in a media release on Sunday.‚ÄúThe whole point of the recovery is aligned with our approach to eventually allow more activities in the economy to resume,‚Äù said Mrs Teo, who spoke to reporters after attending the unveiling of a new Covid-19 medical facility at the JTC Space @ Tuas, catering to foreign workers who do not reside in purpose-built dormitories.The vast majority of new Covid-19 cases in Singapore in recent weeks have been among foreign workers housed in dormitories.Mrs Teo said: ‚ÄúWe are very mindful that from the worker standpoint, ultimately they are here in Singapore to work. And then from their employers' standpoint, workers are here to support their business. The main objective of this recovery phase is how to enable this to happen in a safe way.‚ÄùShe said to achieve this, changes in where the foreign workers live and where they work have to be made.Mrs Teo added that the ministry is now planning a ‚Äúwhole stream of activities‚Äù in order to bring about safe living, as well as safe working for these workers, noting that the virus spreads quickly due to communal living, even if hygiene levels are high.‚ÄúBy safe living and safe working, what we will also enable is for the businesses to continue in a safe way,‚Äù she said.Mrs Teo said the overall operation is ‚Äúa fairly large piece of work‚Äù and that a technical media briefing would be held later to provide further details.A very important aspect of this recovery phase will be focused on how to strengthen health monitoring and surveillance in dormitories, she said. The ministry is, therefore, looking to use technology to enable more effective medical monitoring.‚ÄúWe are introducing new measures that will help us to look after the health conditions, and to do the health surveillance of our foreign workers in a more comprehensive way,‚Äù she said.‚ÄúAnd we hope that by doing so, we will be able to help the individual worker prevent the recurrence if he has already been infected, or for those who have not been infected to prevent them from falling sick in the first place,‚Äù said Mrs Teo.The*new Covid-19 medical facility, which will start operations on Monday, includes a medical post and a swab isolation facility with 150 cubicles for foreign workers to reside in. Of those, 120 will be for workers waiting for their results while the other 30 will be for those who have tested positive. Results usually come back within two to three days.The medical post is the fifth of its kind outside of those that are available in the 43 purpose-built dormitories. The swab isolation facility is the third of its kind.A worker will be transported to the medical facility by shuttle bus if he feels the onset of symptoms of acute respiratory infection. He will be assessed by a doctor at the medical post, who will then determine if the worker is required to take the swab test or not.USING TECHNOLOGYMrs Teo said that about 8,000 pulse oximeters had been issued, with another 12,000 to be given out progressively. The priority is to issue the small, easy-to-use devices to workers with Covid-19 displaying mild symptoms in order to see if their health deteriorates.‚ÄúSo, in all, we're looking at maybe about 20,000 pulse oximeters that will be made available to our foreign workers in the purpose-built dorms, factory-converted dorms as well as the construction temporary quarters.‚ÄùAnother technological innovation at the medical facility is a tele-kiosk machine which facilitates video consultations with doctors and is connected to devices that can monitor vital signs such as blood pressure, oxygen saturation and temperature.Workers who are awaiting their results can connect to a doctor through this machine as doctors are available at all times and medication will be delivered to the workers if necessary. Eight tele-kiosks have been installed in other dormitories.A teleconsultation service via personal mobile devices to provide care after hours has also been set up, enabling workers to contact doctors through WhatsApp video call. Medication will be delivered to the workers if necessary.‚ÄúWhen the workers eventually return to work their work hours are not likely to be the same for each and every one of them,‚Äù Mrs Teo*said.‚ÄúSome of the workers may return to the dormitory at a time where the medical outposts cannot remain open,*so we have to look at what are some of the more sustainable ways to continue to perform this health monitoring, which is a very important part of taking care of the foreign workers.‚ÄùShe added: ‚ÄúWe want them to stay healthy. We want them to be able to continue to support their employer. In order to be able to do so, we must find ways to protect their health. And if there is any cluster that is forming, we need to have some way of detecting it so that we can act fast.‚Äùhttps://www.todayonline.com/singapor...uding-covid-19","10-05-2020, 10:55 PM"," S'pore looking to return foreign workers, including Covid-19 survivors, to work in 'recovery phase'"

"Wife of grassroots leader in workers‚Äô dorm business, shows their Sentosa weekend ‚Äúparty home‚Äù to mediaIt was earlier reported that as of Wed (8 Apr) this week, active COVID-19 clusters have been found at 9 different foreign worker dormitories in Singapore.A few of the 9 are operated by companies linked to grassroots leaders of People‚Äôs Association (PA). The top 2 foreign worker dormitories with the most number of confirmed COVID-19 cases as of yesterday (10 Apr) were S11 Dormitory (306 cases) and Westlite Toh Guan (69 cases). Both have been gazetted by the government as isolation areas under the Infectious Diseases Act.In particular, Westlite Toh Guan is run by public listed company Centurion Corporation Ltd, helmed by two PA grassroots leaders who are ‚Äújoint chairmen‚Äù of the company: David Loh Kim Kang and Han Seng Juan. Han was awarded PBM in 2010 and BBM in 2015, while Loh got his PBM in 2011 and BBM in 2016.They were both given public service medals for ‚Äúhelping‚Äù out at Potong Pasir SMC under MP Sitoh Yih Pin. In the general election of 2011, PAP managed to wrestle back Potong Pasir from opposition and it‚Äôs now under PAP.Another board member of Centurion Corporation, Rajah & Tann‚Äôs lawyer Chandra Mohan, is also a grassroots leader awarded with PBM and BBM in recognition of his contribution towards community services in Northwest Community Development Council (NWCDC).Han‚Äôs Sentosa Cove weekend party home has rooms inspired by four seasonsFurther checks online revealed that socialite Susanna Kang is married to Han. In fact, 4 years ago, Mrs Han opened up their weekend ‚Äúparty home‚Äù at Sentosa Cove for reporters to take a look (‚ÄòChic abodes: Two stylish women open up their homes‚Äò).Mrs Han is said to be a ‚Äúfixture in society magazines‚Äù, often seen wearing head-turning gowns and ensembles, complete with elaborate hairstyles.At the Hans‚Äô Sentosa Cove weekend home, the ST reporter noted the ‚Äúcreative streak‚Äù in its design. ‚ÄúStanding on a 9,000 sq ft plot of land, the expansive house is a weekend home and features rooms inspired by the four seasons,‚Äù the reporter wrote. ‚ÄúIt is here that the family entertain friends and host dinners for close business partners about once a month, with as many as 100 people gathering at what has come to be known as the Party House.‚ÄùApparently, Mrs Han wanted a house that has the ‚Äúwow factor‚Äù for the purpose of entertaining guests. It was built in 2012. A ‚Äúcurtain‚Äù weighing more than 2,721kg imported from Germany and made of high-grade stainless steel cloaks the perimeter of the second floor. It can be pulled back to get an unblocked beautiful view of the sea.When guests arrive at the four-storey house, they descend a long flight of stairs into a cavernous basement. Mrs Han said, ‚ÄúI meant for it to be like a runway, where guests can sashay and strut their stuff down the stairs. It‚Äôs also the perfect spot to see the rest of the house. As you look up from the stairs, you get a good look at what else there is to explore.‚ÄùThe basement is filled with futuristic-looking furniture from well-known brands and designers such as Italian label Moroso and renowned architect Zaha Hadid. An Hermes screen, made of a wood frame and scraps of crocodile skin taken from the cutting-room floor at the French luxury house‚Äôs atelier, adds a luxurious touch. A luscious green wall, filled with creepers growing under ultraviolet light, is encased behind a misty glass screen, creating a tropical spring feel for the basement. Adding to that wild factor are two taxidermied peacocks that preen regally next to the bar.The dining room has a 22-seat custom-made table with bronzed legs and a high-gloss finish ‚Äì the result of multiple layers of lacquer. It beautifully reflects American industrial designer Karim Rashid‚Äôs topograph-shaped chandelier that was made as part of Swarovski‚Äôs Crystal Palace collection.The upper floors were designed for smaller break-out groups for relaxation especially after a nice dinner. On second level there are 3 rooms: One is a karaoke and media room, complete with decor of KTV lounges for the ‚Äúfeel of the real thing‚Äù, said Mrs Han. Another has a masculine vibe with a dark brown sofa by Italian furniture-maker Poltrona Frau and a well-stocked wine chiller. Here, the men can kick back and relax with cigars, while talking business, politics or any other matters. The third room simulates a chic ski resort cabin. Mrs Han has the air-conditioning ducts trained on this area so that the blast of cold air creates that icy feeling. The floor is covered in a fluffy, white carpet and there is a fireplace that runs on ethanol. It produces flames, but not heat.For parties around the pool, guests head to the summer room in the attic that is designed to look like a ship‚Äôs cabin. Sofa beds face the infinity pool outside. For movie nights, a hidden projector comes down and guests can kick back or sleep over if they want to and wake up to a sea view. ‚ÄúI get my respite here. It‚Äôs quite peaceful looking at the blue, open sea,‚Äù she said.She described her Sentosa home as a ‚Äúmodern kelong‚Äù as it is surrounded by water but the family does not live there. Their family home is a good-class bungalow in Bukit Timah.(Pictures of the Hans‚Äô Sentosa Cove weekend home from ST Photo):Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) warns about crammed condition in foreign worker dormitoriesMeanwhile, non-profit organization Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) has been warning about the crammed conditions in foreign worker dormitories being highly conducive to spread the coronavirus (‚ÄòForum: Employers‚Äô practices leave foreign workers vulnerable to infection‚Äò, 23 Mar).Writing to ST Forum on 23 Mar, TWC2 said, ‚ÄúCurrently, foreign workers are housed 12 to 20 men per room in double-decker beds. They are transported to work on the back of lorries sitting shoulder to shoulder. Neither of these conditions conforms with social distancing. The risk of a new cluster among this group remains undeniable,‚ÄùTWC2 warned and advocated that new dormitory should require more space per head and no more than four persons to a room.On TWC2 website, it shows a picture of how crammed the condition is at a dormitory (Westlite Mandai) run by Han‚Äôs company.Indeed, about a week later after TWC2 wrote to ST to warn everyone, clusters of COVID-19 started breaking out in different foreign worker dormitories.Perhaps Han should ask his wife to use her ‚Äúcreative streak‚Äù to also help design the Centurion‚Äôs foreign worker dormitories so that the workers can have less crammed spaces to live in?https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/202...UDJQEHJzCQJekInot sure why, but if u guys wanna look at the house pics have to access the link above.pai say","11-04-2020, 07:25 PM"," Wife of grassroots leader in workers¬í dorm biz', shows their Sentosa weekend ¬ìparty home¬î to media"

"Wife of grassroots leader in workers¬í dorm business, shows their Sentosa weekend ¬ìparty home¬î to mediaIt was earlier reported that as of Wed (8 Apr) this week, active COVID-19 clusters have been found at 9 different foreign worker dormitories in Singapore.A few of the 9 are operated by companies linked to grassroots leaders of People¬ís Association (PA). The top 2 foreign worker dormitories with the most number of confirmed COVID-19 cases as of yesterday (10 Apr) were S11 Dormitory (306 cases) and Westlite Toh Guan (69 cases). Both have been gazetted by the government as isolation areas under the Infectious Diseases Act.In particular, Westlite Toh Guan is run by public listed company Centurion Corporation Ltd, helmed by two PA grassroots leaders who are ¬ìjoint chairmen¬î of the company: David Loh Kim Kang and Han Seng Juan. Han was awarded PBM in 2010 and BBM in 2015, while Loh got his PBM in 2011 and BBM in 2016.They were both given public service medals for ¬ìhelping¬î out at Potong Pasir SMC under MP Sitoh Yih Pin. In the general election of 2011, PAP managed to wrestle back Potong Pasir from opposition and it¬ís now under PAP.Another board member of Centurion Corporation, Rajah & Tann¬ís lawyer Chandra Mohan, is also a grassroots leader awarded with PBM and BBM in recognition of his contribution towards community services in Northwest Community Development Council (NWCDC).Han¬ís Sentosa Cove weekend party home has rooms inspired by four seasonsFurther checks online revealed that socialite Susanna Kang is married to Han. In fact, 4 years ago, Mrs Han opened up their weekend ¬ìparty home¬î at Sentosa Cove for reporters to take a look (¬ëChic abodes: Two stylish women open up their homes¬ë).Mrs Han is said to be a ¬ìfixture in society magazines¬î, often seen wearing head-turning gowns and ensembles, complete with elaborate hairstyles.At the Hans¬í Sentosa Cove weekend home, the ST reporter noted the ¬ìcreative streak¬î in its design. ¬ìStanding on a 9,000 sq ft plot of land, the expansive house is a weekend home and features rooms inspired by the four seasons,¬î the reporter wrote. ¬ìIt is here that the family entertain friends and host dinners for close business partners about once a month, with as many as 100 people gathering at what has come to be known as the Party House.¬îApparently, Mrs Han wanted a house that has the ¬ìwow factor¬î for the purpose of entertaining guests. It was built in 2012. A ¬ìcurtain¬î weighing more than 2,721kg imported from Germany and made of high-grade stainless steel cloaks the perimeter of the second floor. It can be pulled back to get an unblocked beautiful view of the sea.When guests arrive at the four-storey house, they descend a long flight of stairs into a cavernous basement. Mrs Han said, ¬ìI meant for it to be like a runway, where guests can sashay and strut their stuff down the stairs. It¬ís also the perfect spot to see the rest of the house. As you look up from the stairs, you get a good look at what else there is to explore.¬îThe basement is filled with futuristic-looking furniture from well-known brands and designers such as Italian label Moroso and renowned architect Zaha Hadid. An Hermes screen, made of a wood frame and scraps of crocodile skin taken from the cutting-room floor at the French luxury house¬ís atelier, adds a luxurious touch. A luscious green wall, filled with creepers growing under ultraviolet light, is encased behind a misty glass screen, creating a tropical spring feel for the basement. Adding to that wild factor are two taxidermied peacocks that preen regally next to the bar.The dining room has a 22-seat custom-made table with bronzed legs and a high-gloss finish ¬ñ the result of multiple layers of lacquer. It beautifully reflects American industrial designer Karim Rashid¬ís topograph-shaped chandelier that was made as part of Swarovski¬ís Crystal Palace collection.The upper floors were designed for smaller break-out groups for relaxation especially after a nice dinner. On second level there are 3 rooms: One is a karaoke and media room, complete with decor of KTV lounges for the ¬ìfeel of the real thing¬î, said Mrs Han. Another has a masculine vibe with a dark brown sofa by Italian furniture-maker Poltrona Frau and a well-stocked wine chiller. Here, the men can kick back and relax with cigars, while talking business, politics or any other matters. The third room simulates a chic ski resort cabin. Mrs Han has the air-conditioning ducts trained on this area so that the blast of cold air creates that icy feeling. The floor is covered in a fluffy, white carpet and there is a fireplace that runs on ethanol. It produces flames, but not heat.For parties around the pool, guests head to the summer room in the attic that is designed to look like a ship¬ís cabin. Sofa beds face the infinity pool outside. For movie nights, a hidden projector comes down and guests can kick back or sleep over if they want to and wake up to a sea view. ¬ìI get my respite here. It¬ís quite peaceful looking at the blue, open sea,¬î she said.She described her Sentosa home as a ¬ìmodern kelong¬î as it is surrounded by water but the family does not live there. Their family home is a good-class bungalow in Bukit Timah.(Pictures of the Hans¬í Sentosa Cove weekend home from ST Photo):Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) warns about crammed condition in foreign worker dormitoriesMeanwhile, non-profit organization Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) has been warning about the crammed conditions in foreign worker dormitories being highly conducive to spread the coronavirus (¬ëForum: Employers¬í practices leave foreign workers vulnerable to infection¬ë, 23 Mar).Writing to ST Forum on 23 Mar, TWC2 said, ¬ìCurrently, foreign workers are housed 12 to 20 men per room in double-decker beds. They are transported to work on the back of lorries sitting shoulder to shoulder. Neither of these conditions conforms with social distancing. The risk of a new cluster among this group remains undeniable,¬îTWC2 warned and advocated that new dormitory should require more space per head and no more than four persons to a room.On TWC2 website, it shows a picture of how crammed the condition is at a dormitory (Westlite Mandai) run by Han¬ís company.Indeed, about a week later after TWC2 wrote to ST to warn everyone, clusters of COVID-19 started breaking out in different foreign worker dormitories.Perhaps Han should ask his wife to use her ¬ìcreative streak¬î to also help design the Centurion¬ís foreign worker dormitories so that the workers can have less crammed spaces to live in?https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/202...UDJQEHJzCQJekInot sure why, but if u guys wanna look at the house pics have to access the link above.pai sayWhy you so sour grape ?","18-04-2020, 02:07 PM"," Wife of grassroots leader in workers¬í dorm biz', shows their Sentosa weekend ¬ìparty home¬î to media"

"The Republic has been aggressively testing foreign workers for the coronavirus, even those who are well and have no symptoms, the multi-ministry task force told a press conference on Tuesday (April 21).Authorities have refrained from testing every single person in the larger community because of their sheer number, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, who co-chairs the task force.Singapore has a ""very strategic way"" of conducting tests, he explained.He said: ""We have millions of Singaporeans, and we will not be able to test every one of them. So... we do targeted testing.""For instance, tests are done on essential workers who need to go out to ensure that they are not carrying the infection while going to work.A random testing programme, known as sentinel surveillance, is also used to pick up cases in the community that would otherwise have gone undetected.This programme is aimed at finding people who have the virus, but have very mild symptoms or do not meet criteria that will make them a suspect case.Such testing has revealed that there are still cases of Covid-19 being transmitted in the community, some of whom remain infectious despite mild symptoms, said Mr Gan.""That is why we need to put in extra effort (with) these circuit breaker measures, to make sure that we are able to bring down these community cases, particularly those that are unlinked,"" he said.The Health Ministry's Director of Medical Services, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, said that although the number of tests conducted varied on a daily basis, it could rise to between 2,800 and 3,000 on some days.Between 1,500 and 2,500 of these tests were being carried out on foreign workers.Mr Gan explained that testing helped to give a sense of the prevalence of Covid-19 in the dormitories, allowing the authorities to identify those where the disease is more widespread, and determine the level of response.It also enables those in charge to identify infected patients and get them the necessary medical attention.Noting that over 5,000 foreign workers had already tested positive for the virus, Assoc Prof Mak said: ""We've in fact (tested) more than that, because there's also those (that) tested negative as well. So the number continues to grow.""But Singapore is prepared for the increased pace of testing. Earlier on Tuesday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in an address to the nation, said that in addition to developing and manufacturing its own test kits Singapore was also getting them from overseas.Mr Gan explained during the press conference that this was intended to help keep testing options open here.""We want to be able to also use different models, different test kits, different ways of testing,"" he said.He added that the purchase of test kits from overseas was also intended to help Singapore increase its testing capacity and capabilities, in order to prepare for the eventual lifting of circuit breaker measures.""Our testing is not just for now... as we progress in opening up our circuit breaker measures, we will need to increase our testing capability because we need to make sure that there is no transmission in the community - and in order to make sure that there's no transmission in the community, we need to test a lot more,"" he said.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...ost-on-foreign","21-04-2020, 10:27 PM"," Up to 3,000 tests for Covid-19 done daily in S'pore, most on foreign workers"

"Too difficult to test every resident for infection...I suggest to test on per household basis.Since residents in the same household are rikely to be in close proximity and masks are typically not worn indoors, then testing just one member per household works fine, and testing everyone in the household is only needed if one member is discovered to be infected.However even for that be viable, we will need to expand our testing capability by 10x per day to finish testing all households within 6-7 weeks in the best case scenario...And that ish just to test for infection, testing for resistance ish another thing all together.On top of that there ish this issue of ppl being required to run essential services and buying of supplies. Not exactly doable unless a full lockdown is implemented where everyone is required to stay at home and supplies are distributed.Earlier on there were discussion about segmenting SG into 4 regions for coordinated full lockdowns for testing/recovery. Was thinking about the issues involved and difficulty in enforcing movement and abuses. After checking out SG's map, I think it might be doable, though might not be in exactly 4 zones. There are still quite a large number of natural defensible choke points, which, if public transport services were being coordinated/controlled properly, human movement out of the zones could be enforced. The placement of the ""natural chokepoints"" almost seems strategically and deliberately placed.The major issue would be that the essential services workers might need to travel across entire island to work. Those personnel would either have to stay in at or near their work place for the period of time away from the family, or that they would have to stop work for a long time.","22-04-2020, 12:52 AM"," Up to 3,000 tests for Covid-19 done daily in S'pore, most on foreign workers"

If you catch the vibe, it means for the workers in the 43 dorms, should we mass test all of them, we can safely assume at least 10% of them would be infected and this means 50,000 workers at least. We are still sweeping though the domes now, but 3000 is the number of tests we can conduct daily, but how many foreign workers do we have? Around 1 million. Let‚Äôs not forget that those whom we haven‚Äôt tested yet could be positive and in their dorms asymptomatically infecting others before the test can reach them.

They also receive onsite medical support and enhanced health screening.COVID-19 infections have spiked in foreign worker dormitories recently, with cases linked to 10 such dormitories across the island. Out of Singapore's 2,108 COVID-19 cases, more than 500 cases are linked to dormitories.Photos and videos circulating on social media earlier this week appeared to show crowded and unsanitary conditions at the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol -  currently the largest coronavirus cluster in Singapore, with 306 cases. MOM said it had instituted ¬ìenhanced waste management and sanitation regimes¬î at the four isolation areas. ¬ìThe frequency of refuse collection and removal from the premises for disposal have been increased from once a day to three to five times daily, depending on the premises,¬î said the ministry. It noted that disinfection and cleaning of common areas and washroom facilities are also being carried out an average of thrice a day at the four isolation areas. These measures will also be introduced at the Tampines Dormitory - where are there currently 49 COVID-19 cases - which was also gazetted as the fifth such isolation area on Friday. MOM also noted that dormitory operators had been working with external vendors as well as in-house cleaners to improve the cleanliness and sanitation in the dorms. The measures taken include increasing the rounds of cleaning at the dormitories up to five times a day and getting additional to clean frequently used areas such as toilets and corridors. External vendors have also been engaged to clear rubbish at the isolation areas, as well as increasing the frequency of disinfecting from twice to four times daily.  ¬ìMOM officers have been working round the clock at the dormitories gazetted as isolation areas to ensure the foreign workers¬í well-being is taken care of and the living conditions are of the highest standards,¬î said the ministry. It added it would act on feedback provided by dormitory residents to determine possible areas of improvements. In a video posted on his Facebook page on Friday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Singapore was paying ¬ìclose attention¬î to the welfare of foreign workers, amid the COVID-19 outbreak. ""They came to Singapore to work hard for a living, and provide for their families back home ...

This is between 10-5 and 9-5 situation reports.  This time there is a sharp drop of the number of cases of WP(STOD) cases from 627 to 466 people. WP(STOD)10-5 figure should be 627+11 = 638however it was reported as 466.638-466 = 172 cases shortfall.DORM10-5- figure should be 19971+860 = 20831however it was reported as 20961.20961-20831 = 130 cases increase.172-130 = 42 cases balance.

"MOH released a press release today on Scaling up of testing for COVID-19.https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highligh...vid-19-testing 27TH APR 20201. Testing is a critical enabler of our fight against COVID-19. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been steadily building up our national capacity to conduct tests for COVID-19. From an average of 2,900 tests per day in early April, we are now able to conduct more than 8,000 tests per day. To date, Singapore has tested about 2,100 per 100,000 persons. In comparison, the US has tested 1,600 per 100,000 and the UK 1,000 per 100,000. The higher intensity of testing allows us to pick up far more cases than many other countries.2. We have taken steps to continue building up our testing capacity over the coming weeks and months. Even as we do so, we will continue to prioritise our existing testing capacity based on public health considerations.Testing for Diagnosis and Surveillance3. Testing is used for three key purposes. First, for diagnosis in order to provide the appropriate treatment early for persons who are unwell. Second, for active case finding in order to identity infected individuals early and isolate them. Contact tracing around confirmed cases allows us to ring-fence any clusters, and prevent further transmissions. And third, for surveillance purposes, in particular of groups at higher risk of contracting or transmitting the disease.4. Such testing is done systematically across our hospitals, polyclinics and general practitioner clinics. We test high risk groups showing symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI), such as those who are close contacts of confirmed cases, those with travel history, patients already diagnosed with pneumonia, or patients with prolonged ARI. We also conduct testing as a means of general surveillance to detect signs of community spread and to pick up unlinked cases.Testing in the Migrant Worker Dormitories5. A similar testing strategy is applied to our migrant worker community, including those living in dormitories. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has been testing close to 3,000 migrant workers residing at the dormitories every day, and will continue to do more tests. Many of these workers showed no symptoms when they were tested. In most countries, people who are asymptomatic are not tested. To date, more than 21,000 migrant workers living in dormitories have been tested. This means that we have tested about one in 15 workers in dormitories (or 6,500 per 100,000), far higher than the testing rates seen in countries like South Korea (one in 90, or 1,100 per 100,000).6. This aggressive testing regime enables us to determine the extent of infection in the dormitories. Those who are confirmed with COVID-19 infection will be reported in the daily tally of newly confirmed cases. We started with the dormitories with a higher incidence of infections, and are continuing to test the workers in the other dormitories.7. Due to the need to prioritise, we are not be able to test all in the dormitories at one go. But if any worker were to report sick or show ARI symptoms, we will immediately pull aside and isolate the worker from his room-mates, and ensure that he receives the necessary medical care. This allows us to provide medical care quickly to the symptomatic foreign workers, and to ensure that those with higher risk factors or have more severe illnesses are transferred to receive care at our healthcare institutions.8. One urgent priority is to test migrant workers who have moved out of the dormitories but are continuing to work in essential services. This is to reduce the risk of transmission in workplaces and to the wider community.Testing for Protection and Monitoring9. Finally, we are doing more tests to protect vulnerable groups. For instance, we are testing the staff at nursing homes where there is close contact with seniors, as well as healthcare workers and frontline officers who have regular contact with confirmed cases. This will help to ensure that they continue to stay healthy, and receive medical treatment promptly if required.10. As more testing capacity is brought on-stream, we will gradually expand testing to the wider pool of workers in order to ensure the continuity of critical functions and services. This is important, as it will also enable us to progressively resume economic activities beyond the circuit breaker period.Holistic Strategy11. While testing is important, it has to be part of a broader strategy to fight COVID-19. Testing alone cannot substitute for other important measures like safe distancing and infection control. Individual responsibility in upholding good personal hygiene, minimising contact, and seeing a doctor immediately when sick are all critical aspects of the overall strategy. Together, we can slow down transmissions, beat the virus, and emerge stronger after the crisis.MINISTRY OF HEALTH27 APRIL 2020","27-04-2020, 09:28 PM", [OFFICIAL] SINGAPORE COVID-19 Consolidated Info Thread

"https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...hcare-12715806SINGAPORE: Processes and measures taken at COVID-19 community care and recovery facilities will be reviewed, after several cases of healthcare workers and volunteers being infected.Four people who worked at the Singapore Expo community care facility have tested positive for the coronavirus as of Thursday (May 7). They include a radiographer, two nurses and a healthcare volunteer. Two quarantine officers who served at various foreign worker dormitories have also contracted COVID-19.Authorities are looking into how transmission occurred - whether they were infected by patients or by interaction with other staff members.","08-05-2020, 10:56 PM", [OFFICIAL] SINGAPORE COVID-19 Consolidated Info Thread
"My opinion on the current situation is that the dormitory cases is still a long way to be under control. Yesterday's press release indicated that a volunteer at one of the dormitories most likely got the virus at the dormitory and went home to infect her family member. So there is risk of leakage from the dormitories if their protocols are weak to protect healthcare workers there.Bad or worse I am not sure, there is a lot of information that MOH did not release to the public so the full picture is not known. what i feel is that the circuit breaker will extend if community cases and workers who stay out of dorm figures maintain at the current levels.hope doesnt extendSent from Samsung SM-N950F using GAGT","08-05-2020, 11:10 PM", [OFFICIAL] SINGAPORE COVID-19 Consolidated Info Thread

Major Discrepancy found in MOH's situation report for the 3rd instance. This is between 10-5 and 9-5 situation reports.  This time there is a sharp drop of the number of cases of WP(STOD) cases from 627 to 466 people. WP(STOD)10-5 figure should be 627+11 = 638however it was reported as 466.638-466 = 172 cases shortfall.DORM10-5- figure should be 19971+860 = 20831however it was reported as 20961.20961-20831 = 130 cases increase.172-130 = 42 cases balance. Where did this 42 cases go? Look at the subtotal for community cases btw 10th and 9th reports.the figure for 10-5 should be 1129+17 = 1146however it was reported as 11881188-1146 = 42So that shows to me that subtracted cases from the period between 10-5 to 27-4 of the situation report and put it in the before 27-Apr figures at the top of the table. This is the graph after the corrections are appliedThis is the graph before the corrections are appliedDo note that the 7 day average trend line of the chart with the amended figures shows a more pronounced lower trend line then when it's not corrected. Why is MOH amending the data in such a way to show a lower and more positive trend line? This shows to me how unreliable MOH's data are. As such i will no longer update this chart as the figures are totally unreliable.is the situation report based on press release figures or onset of symptom figures? can MOH come clean on this?,"12-05-2020, 05:03 PM", [OFFICIAL] SINGAPORE COVID-19 Consolidated Info Thread

"Ambassador-at-large Chan Heng Chee said in an interview that Singapore's high Covid-19 numbers relative to the region was due to the difference in testing capabilities, and that Singapore was testing aggressively for the virus.Said that Singapore knew foreign workers would be a stress pointSpeaking in an interview with CNBC, Chan said that Singapore ""knew that the foreign workers would be a stress point"".She added that when the first Covid-19 case involving a foreign worker was found on Feb. 8, 2020, ""no one in the world knew about asymptomatic cases"".""On April 3, there were just 36 cases amongst the foreign workers. We did what we always do ¬ó we test, we track, and we quarantined them, but later it just exploded,"" Chan told CNBC.Moving out of dormitories earlier would not have made big differenceChan said that Singapore could have moved the foreign workers out of the dormitories earlier, but opined that it would have hardly made a difference in transmission.""(The foreign workers) would be going to work, they would be cooking together in communal activities, and they would be going to the mall,"" Chan said.She told CNBC that the Singapore government had reacted ""very decisively"", providing medical attention to every worker, giving them food, entertainment, and WiFi access.""More importantly, we are telling them that they will keep their jobs and they will be paid,"" Chan added.The more you test, the more numbers you haveShe also told CNBC that Singapore was experiencing a surge in Covid-19 cases as the government was testing ""aggressively and transparently"".""The more you test, the more numbers you have,"" Chan said.""In the region, you find that testing capabilities are different, so our numbers look much higher than others.""She also added that Singapore had the densest population in the world, with the exception of Monaco, and dense cities have a problem dealing with epidemics and pandemics.Put into contextChan added that she wanted to put the numbers ""into context"".""Bear in mind you have 11,000 people in Singapore who are confirmed infected, but 26 are in critical condition, 1,300 or so are in hospital, stable and improving,"" she said.Chan said that another 8,800 mild cases are currently in isolation centres, and added: ""So the numbers don¬ít look as grim as all that.""https://mothership.sg/2020/04/chan-heng-chee-covid-19/","24-04-2020, 10:44 PM", Ambassador-at-large Chan Heng Chee says Covid-19 numbers high as S'pore 'tests aggressively'

"Hmm. Won¬ít say it¬ís fake lah. It¬ís just the standard. All other countries are doing the same on this as well including Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea etc. Only when you are sick and do not recover, then do you see the doctor again to do a swab test. The 5 day MC is just a delayed response, it does not increase the numbers but bring it to 5-7 days later only if you do not recover. Based on 3000 test capability for Singapore now, this is unreasonable as most persons with the same kind of symptoms as COVID-19 could number at least 30,000 daily. Tests can be ordered at most GPs and polyclinics now already, so if you feel strongly you need a test, you can just inform the doctor. My thinking is better not unless you don¬ít recover. Actually ok wan, then you are waiting and queuing with somebody with COVID, you touch the desk of the nurse who¬ís administering the swab test for you, after that you go home take out mask, accidentally touch your face etc. So better not. A 5-day delay is reasonable to filter out this virus. It is unlikely that you will not recover from a sore throat if you on antibiotics like Augmentin or Klacid for example.

"1. As of 23 April 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 1,037 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:      a) Imported cases: 0      There are no imported cases today.      b) Cases in the community: 25 (22 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents1, 3 Work Passes)The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 34 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 25 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has decreased slightly, from an average of 20 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 18 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.      c) Work Permit holders (residing outside dormitories): 30The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside dormitories has continued to increase, from an average of 16 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 30 per day in the past week.       d) Work Permit holders (residing in dormitories): 982The main increase today continues to be for Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, where we are picking up many more cases because of extensive testing. Most of these cases have a mild illness and are being monitored in the community isolation facilities or general ward of our hospitals. None of them is in the intensive care unit.2. Details of these trends can be found in MOH‚Äôs daily situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.3. Of the new cases, 75% are linked to known clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.Links between previous cases found4. In the past week (16 April to 22 April), MOH has uncovered links for 1,024 previously unlinked cases.5. Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer to Annex B for details.Update on condition of confirmed cases6. 36 more cases2 of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 924 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.7. As our care protocols adapt based on our understanding of the disease, we have re-categorised the confirmed cases to more accurately reflect where the confirmed cases are being cared for. There are currently 1,368 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 26 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. 8,874 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 12 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.8. Case 8190, a 46 year-old male Indian national, has passed away on 23 April. He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 19 April, and had been warded at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. Police investigations into his death are ongoing.

"Why the PAP has failed14 Feb - there was a foreign worker tested positive for COVID-19 and he was rushed into ICU a day later. 17 Feb - 2 more foreign workers were tested positive for the virus. 18 Feb - it was revealed that they formed a new cluster from a work site.News came out and employers rushed to send their foreign workers, who are unwell, to the hospital for a swab test.19 Feb - MOM published a news article from Mr Kelvin Teoh (divisional director of MOM for foreign workers) that employers must not send the foreign workers to the hospital or they may have their WORK PASS privileges suspended. Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet. The poor foreign workers in numbers of 300,000 became victims of the PAP government, due to their lack of hindsight and that huge stench of arrogance to listen to the public when many threads about the issue was raised in and around mid Feb. To this day, neither did Mr Kelvin Teoh nor Josephine Teo nor PAP Taskforce apologise to Singaporean and the foreign workers.(Saw this comment on fb)Full timeline of the government's response to the dormitory crisis consolidated with all known articles and moh publications.

Had they had taken care of the dorm situation earlier, our infection rate would not be so high, and more importantly, these resources that are being expended to rectify the FW situation could have be used elsewhere.All the while they have been damn reactive what... Told them to ban Wuhan people they also dowan, say cannot xenophobic, Confucius teaching...Then healthy no wear masks... Life goes on as usual.

If the MIW is so good and perfect as you said to be, there won't be a crisis at the dormitories now. Our government is always a few steps behind the virus and data don't lie. There is no insinuation of vast community spread but suspicion, it's MOH's approach to regard workers who does not live in dorms as non community cases that drew suspicion they are trying to play with numbers to make it look like community spread is low vs dormitory linked cases within the dorms and dorms to community. Then there is the withholding of information from public. the annex which already was deprived of many crucial information on specific cases was abruptly stopped on 19th april. Now no one can independently track and collate the cases anymore. You can argue MOH got interactive that shows all the cases. You got go try? moment you go in the page will freeze and hang. Then there is no cluster map to link the dormitories to other clusters too, which will show the full extend of the spread of the virus.

"Another 42 dormitories for foreign workers in Singapore have been cleared of the coronavirus disease, taking the total to over 130.In a press release issued by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Tuesday, the 42 dorms housing around 4,000 residents include one purpose-built dorm, 39 factory-converted dorms, and two construction temporary quarters.This brings the total number of dorms cleared of COVID-19 to 132, and 14 blocks of recovered workers in purpose-built dorms.Separately, the MOM advised that dorm operators, employers and migrant workers have to complete three required steps before workers can resume work.Step 1:*Dorm operators to arrange staggered pick-up/drop-off timing with employersStep 2:*Employers to confirm or update the residential addresses of their workers on MOM databaseStep 3:*Workers to download FWMOMCare to update health status and report residence location that matches with employers¬í and dorm operators¬í records; and download TraceTogether to facilitate contact tracingAs of Monday, 67 dorms out of 132 have completed these steps and some of the 10,000 residents have resumed working.¬ìThe Forward Assurance & Support Teams (FAST) are working closely with dormitory operators, employers and migrant workers to complete all the necessary steps and clear the remaining dormitories,¬î said the ministry.¬ìEmployers can refer to the MOM website for the latest list of cleared dormitories and dormitories to be cleared in the coming week.¬îThe MOM added that it will be possible to progressively reduce the density of migrant workers¬í living space with more blocks and dorms cleared, and new ones ¬ñ quick built dormitories and construction temporary quarters ¬ñ becoming available over the next few months.¬ìAs we continue to gradually resume work, we urge all dormitory operators, employers and workers to remain vigilant and ensure that the Safe Working and Safe Living measures are rigorously followed,¬î it added.To date, Singapore has*40,969 cases, of which over 38,500 are foreign workers living in dorms.https://sg.news.yahoo.com/amphtml/42...141525666.html","16-06-2020, 10:32 PM", 42 more foreign worker dorms cleared of COVID-19: MOM

"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...nd-clusters-inRecord 287 new Covid-19 cases in S'pore, links found between Mustafa Centre and clusters in foreign worker dormitoriesRecord 287 new Covid-19 cases in S'pore, links found between Mustafa Centre and clusters in foreign worker dormitories.SINGAPORE - Singapore saw a sharp spike of 287 coronavirus cases on Thursday (April 9), with the majority linked to foreign worker dormitories.This is the highest daily number reported to date and brings the total number of cases here to 1,910, as the global number of cases crossed the 1.5 million mark.Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean is now advising the multi-ministry task force on handling the Covid-19 situation in foreign worker dormitories, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, noting that the police and Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) are involved in operations there.To cut the chain of transmission in dormitories, thousands of foreign workers who are healthy - especially those working in essential services - will be moved to army camps, floating hotels, and vacant Housing Board blocks.Singapore has also started active case finding and is swab-testing workers in various dormitories, said the Health Ministry's (MOH) director of medical services Kenneth Mak at a press conference on Thursday.Preliminary investigations have linked the cluster at Mustafa Centre with clusters at the construction site at Project Glory and five dormitories.Associate Professor Mak said the ministry believes that foreign workers had visited Mustafa Centre, where some employees had fallen ill, and got infected there.They then transmitted the infection to their co-workers, who subsequently infected others at their dormitories.""Many had very mild symptoms and so they continued to work, that's why there was a delay in picking them up,"" said Mr Wong, who chairs the ministerial task force along with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong. It is likely that the virus had been spreading in dormitories for some time, he said.Mr Wong said Singapore is dealing with two separate infection spreads.In foreign worker dormitories, numbers are rising sharply, he noted. But in the wider community, numbers are more stable.""This is a major and urgent issue that requires active intervention,"" he said. ""That is why we decided to put in more resources and set up a dedicated task force focusing on dorms.""On Tuesday, the Manpower Ministry (MOM) had announced the formation of an inter-agency task force to provide support to foreign workers and dormitory operators.The task force will ensure the well-being of workers and improve their living conditions by supporting dormitory operators as they implement circuit breaker measures.MOM is supported by the Ministry of Health, National Environment Agency, the SAF, the Singapore Police Force, Migrant Workers' Centre and other agencies.Explaining the Government's decision to set up a task force, Mr Wong said: ""We cannot rely solely on dorm operators anymore, given the current situation.""Manpower Minister Josephine Teo noted that there has been no cluster in dormitories until recently, even though a number of foreign workers have tested positive for the virus.""Bear in mind that dorms are home to foreign workers,"" she added. ""Within dorms workers interact with each other very regularly, very closely, they're like family, so the risk of transmission was always there.""Workers will now not be able to prepare their own meals, to reduce human contact, and cleanliness and hygiene have been stepped up. Existing sick bays will also be scaled up to take care of workers that need to be isolated.","09-04-2020, 08:30 PM", <Straits Times> Record 287 new Covid-19 cases in S'pore

"lol. MoM really look very foolish now.From BBC:Singapore's foreign workers 'among the most vulnerable'Andreas IllmerSingapore""In  Singapore, the recent spike in new positive tests is largely taking  place among foreign workers. They are housed in huge dormitories and  often live with 10 to 20 people in one room. The virus clusters in those  dorms are spreading fast.‚ÄúMany  of the dorms are now quarantined,"" Alex Au of migrant rights group  Transient Workers Count Too told the BBC. ""But that‚Äôs like quarantining a  cruise ship - in the end, thousands of workers will contract the virus  which makes them one of the most vulnerable groups.‚ÄùIt's  a crisis of neglect, he says. ""When authorities did their crisis  modelling and began implementing social distancing guidelines, it seems  they completely forgot that the workers are living in very different  conditions to most other Singaporeans.""The  city has now begun moving some workers into different facilities to  enable social distancing, but Au says it‚Äôs a drop in the ocean.""Plenty of COVIDIOTS in Parliment","15-04-2020, 04:24 PM", [BREAKING] 5000 FOREIGN WORKERS TO UNDERGO COVID-19 TEST

"OMG! That's the reason employers of FDWs are very very scared and silent about it...no wonder lah...Conclusion bad move and decision by MOM...Coronavirus: Employers who send healthy workers to hospitals for Covid-19 test may get work pass privileges suspended, warns MOMSINGAPORE - Do not send employees to hospitals unless there is a medical emergency, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has warned employers, after hospitals reported that employers were dropping off workers to have them tested for the coronavirus.""Employers who act irresponsibly by misusing medical facilities may have their work pass privileges suspended,"" it added.In a message sent to employers seen by The Straits Times on Wednesday (Feb 19), Mr Kevin Teoh, divisional director of MOM's foreign manpower management division, said the ministry had been getting feedback from hospitals that employers were sending their workers to be tested for Covid-19, as the disease is now known.ST has contacted the Health Ministry for more information on the extent of such behaviour.Mr Teoh reminded employers that hospitals will not test individuals who are well.""This is to ensure that medical facilities and resources are focused on unwell individuals who need medical treatment,"" he said.A worker who is unwell should be sent to a general practitioner, who will then assess if the worker needs to be taken to hospital.""Our hospitals are working hard to ensure that medical emergencies are handled promptly,"" said Mr Teoh.""We encourage you to be socially responsible and only send workers to the hospital if it is a medical emergency, as doing so otherwise will deny immediate treatment to those who need it.""He added that employers should monitor the health of their workers by checking their temperature twice daily and reminding them to observe good personal hygiene, such as washing their hands with soap frequently. MOM has been taking employers and workers to task for not following rules restricting workers‚Äô  entry and movements when returning from China.For example, it revoked the work passes of two workers and suspended their employers‚Äô work pass privileges on Thursday (Feb 13) for breaching entry approval requirements.On Feb 9, it repatriated four work pass holders and suspended six employers for not complying with Leave of Absence rules.On Monday, the Government introduced the Stay-Home Notice scheme which requires all who return from China not to leave their homes for 14 days.MOM said the scheme also applies to all work pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China.This is stricter than the previous Leave of Absence scheme, where people could still leave their residence briefly for food and other necessities. https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...-hospitals-forI remember reading this news I was like wtf.

"The Ministry of Defence (Mindef) started recruiting former Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regulars as the inter-agency task force handling a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases at foreign worker dormitories had asked for ‚Äúpersonnel with operational experience‚Äù.They were to augment the Forward Assurance Support Teams (Fast) deployed at various foreign worker dormitories, Mindef said in response to TODAY‚Äôs queries on Sunday (April 19).Manpower Minister Josephine Teo announced the formation of such teams on April 9 as part of the Government‚Äôs strategies to manage daily needs such as food, and ensure cleanliness and hygiene at those sites.At the time, she said that a team is assigned to each of the 43 purpose-built worker dormitories, and each team comprises nine officers from the SAF, police and the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).On Thursday, Mindef alerted the public through a Facebook post that fake recruitment messages were circulating through text messaging platforms, although it acknowledged that the ministry was indeed hiring former SAF regulars to support the task force.The fake messages asked interested former SAF regulars to submit their personal particulars to the ministry and PrimeStaff email addresses, and promised a pay package of S$5,000 to S$5,500 for every ‚Äúcompleted month of work‚Äù. PrimeStaff is an employment agency.Giving more details on Sunday, Mindef said that it did not hold an open recruitment and had instead reached out to former regulars directly.It added that shortlisted candidates would undergo necessary training with the taskforce, including going on site visits, to familiarise themselves with their roles before being progressively deployed in the coming weeks.Mindef said it ‚Äútakes the health and safety of our personnel seriously‚Äù.It is working closely with the taskforce to ensure that the appropriate precautionary measures for personnel involved in Covid-19 operations are implemented in accordance with the Ministry of Health‚Äôs guidelines.The inter-agency task force handling the Covid-19 outbreak at foreign workers‚Äô dormitories was set up on April 7. The task force, which involves personnel from the Health Ministry, MOM, SAF and the Home Team, is led by Brigadier-General Seet Uei Lim, Chief Guards Officer at SAF.https://www.todayonline.com/singapor...ntain-covid-19","19-04-2020, 11:55 PM", Ex-SAF regulars called upon as ¬ëpersonnel with operational experience¬í to tackle Covid-19 at dorms

"PUTRAJAYA: While Malaysia has not detected any COVID-19 cluster among the foreign workers, there have been continuous efforts to screen them for the coronavirus.Health Ministry director-general Noor Hisham Abdullah said in a daily press conference on Thursday (Apr 16) that the ministry would focus on high-risk areas with a huge population of foreign workers.¬ìThe screening is ongoing with our PKD (district health offices). So far we have not seen a cluster formation. It is a continuous process,¬î he said.Dr Noor Hisham said the ministry realised that some of the foreign workers have not been coming forward to be screened. Therefore, the ministry is working with several non-governmental organisations (NGO) to reach out to them.Mercy Malaysia and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees were among the NGOs involved, he added. In a wholesale market in Selayang, Selangor, a total of 465 foreign workers have been screened, the director-general revealed. https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...going-12651768","17-04-2020, 04:50 PM"," No foreign worker COVID-19 cluster for now, but screening ongoing: Malaysian health ministry"

"After Singapore¬ís Covid-19 spike, Health D-G urges firms to check on migrant workersFriday, 17 Apr 2020 06:27 PM MYTBY JULIA CHANHealth workers arrive at Menara City One in Kuala Lumpur March 31, 2020. ¬ó Picture by Hari AnggaraHealth workers arrive at Menara City One in Kuala Lumpur March 31, 2020. ¬ó Picture by Hari AnggaraKUALA LUMPUR, April 17 ¬ó With 601 cases of Covid-19 among foreigners in the country, companies employing foreign workers must take the necessary precautions to prevent new clusters, Datuk Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah said.The Health director-general said the 601 cases detected consisted of 108 Indonesians, 104 Filipinos, 63 Bangladeshis, 60 Indians and 51 Pakistanis.¬ìThis group includes tourists, foreign workers, refugees and asylum seekers. Of this, there have been three deaths, while 356 are still being treated and 242 have recovered,¬î he said in his daily briefing today.He said that Malaysia must take note of developments in Singapore, which experienced a spike in cases, of which more than 50 per cent were in migrant workers¬í dormitories.¬ìBecause Malaysia also hires a lot of foreign workers, we need to take action to prevent the virus from spreading among our foreign-worker community,¬î he said.He said it was the responsibility of employers to ensure necessary action was taken to protect its workers by following the guidelines set by the authorities.These include taking each employees temperature and monitoring for symptoms, increase disinfection exercises in common areas, social distancing for work and outside of work shifts and no congregations or confined spaces whether at work or in staff quarters among others.Singapore saw its sharpest single-day spike of 728 new coronavirus cases yesterday, of which foreign workers living in dormitories made up 654, or almost 90 per cent.The total number of foreign workers linked to dorms who have tested positive for Covid-19 is 2,689 ¬ó about 60 per cent of all Singapore¬ís cases.The total number of cases in SIngapore is up to 4,427.While the spread of the virus in the wider community has held steady over the past two weeks, the number of cases linked to foreign workers in dormitories has risen exponentially over the past two weeks.Dr Noor Hisham also said that the ministry was working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to ensure refugees and asylum seekers were included in the authorities¬í effort to prevent and curb the infection which has so far caused 86 deaths in the country.¬ìWe are also working closely with the relevant embassies and non-governmental organisations to help spread news and information about our efforts, in their native language.Flourish logoA Flourish chartSource : https://www.malaymail.com/news/malay...igrant/1857724After reading this article , i feel xia suay .. as Sinkie","18-04-2020, 12:55 PM"," After Singapore¬ís Covid-19 spike, Health D-G urges firms to check on migrant workers"

" ""Migrant workers are viewed only as digits on a spreadsheet of menial labour, to be deployed as resources when necessary and kept out of sight when not.""She added that conditions at dorms have varied, with workers reporting hot and stuffy rooms and issues with food quality and quantity, some of whom were Bangladeshis fasting during Ramadan.Mr Mirpuri said the government cares for the welfare of migrant workers, giving free treatment to workers who show symptoms ""just like everyone else"".Meals and internet access are catered for workers being quarantined at the dorms, and during Ramadan, Muslim workers got their meals before dawn so that they could perform their religious practices, he said.Support is also given to employers so workers can continue to get paid and arrangements have been made for workers to remit money to their families.Mr Mirpuri said 3,000 public officers have been deployed to support dormitory operators and employers, and many Singaporeans have volunteered time, effort and money to complement the government's efforts.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has also publicly committed to caring for migrant workers like Singaporeans, he added. ""The scope and scale of our efforts reflects the responsibility we feel for our migrant workers,"" he said.MANY CHOOSE TO CONTINUE WORKING IN SINGAPOREIn her piece, Ms Han said the fact that about 20 dorm operators and an average of 1,200 employers are penalised yearly for flouting licensing laws suggested substandard living conditions are a long-standing problem that has not been effectively addressed.She noted that rights groups had urged the government to address issues of overcrowding and sanitation even before the pandemic hit the dorms, but the concerns were brushed off.""Now that activists have been proved right in the most miserable way, Singapore still struggles with seeing migrant workers as equally valuable members of the community,"" she wrote.In his response, Mr Mirpuri said any approach to migrant worker welfare must take into account practical realities like Singapore's ageing society, small indigenous workforce, and lack of a hinterland to draw additional workers from.Housing migrant workers in land scarce Singapore can never be straightforward, he said.The government decided to meet this challenge with dorms built to specified standards, which have been progressively raised, with laws passed in 2015 requiring large dorms to have recreational and health facilities, and some amenities.While dorms allow workers to socialise and relax together, any communal living space comes with risks in an infectious outbreak, he added.Recognising the risks, the government in January told dorm operators to take several precautions, more stringent than those for the general population. When cases grew sharply despite the measures, a massive effort was mobilised to take care of workers, he said.Ms Han had also said that the current posture toward migrant workers will hamper efforts for systemic change after the pandemic, and places them in an even more vulnerable position in society.Already stigmatised as dirty or threats to public order, they are now also blamed by some for the spike in Covid-19 cases or berated for not being grateful enough, she added.Mr Mirpuri acknowledged that the government's response has not been perfect. ""There certainly are areas we can improve. We are determined to learn from this episode and will do a thorough review after the crisis is over.""He added that some migrant workers have been in Singapore for as long as 20 years.""They have chosen to continue to live and work in Singapore, rather than go elsewhere or return to work in their home countries,"" he said.""Their revealed preference shows the reality of the migrant worker experience in Singapore. They reflect what the government and Singaporeans have done to care for the migrant workers in our midst.""https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...id-19-outbreak","28-05-2020, 06:48 PM", S'pore ambassador to US rebuts article by Kirsten Han on Covid-19 outbreak in dorms

"SINGAPORE - Some 21 vacant Housing Board blocks in Bukit Merah are being refurbished to house healthy foreign workers working in essential services, the Ministry of National Development (MND) has said.The workers will start to move into the three-room flats progressively as works are completed in the coming weeks.MND said in response to queries from The Straits Times on Wednesday (April 8) that the affected blocks had earlier undergone the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme, which buys back from residents public housing sitting on land with high redevelopment potential for other purposes.The flats were vacated in 2018 but not yet demolished.With foreign dormitories becoming a source of concern for the spread of the coronavirus in recent days, an inter-agency task force has been set up to, among other things, ensure that any disruption to essential services is minimised by having workers in these industries housed separately.The foreign workers who are expected to move into the Redhill Close flats work in areas such as cleaning and maintenance.In a notice to residents in the area on Monday, Minister of State for Social and Family Development Sam Tan said that the dormitories of the workers slated to move in have not been spared from Covid-19.Covid-19: Don't miss the latest on the outbreak and its impactStay in the know with e-mail alertsEnter your e-mail Sign upBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions.Housing them separately will ""keep them safe from the disease, which will in turn keep us safe when they are working in our midst"", said Mr Tan, who is also Minister of State for Foreign Affairs.He also assured residents that just like the rest of Singapore during the ""circuit breaker"" measures, which began on Tuesday, the workers will remain in their flats except to travel to work using company transport or to buy essentials.Related StoryCoronavirus: Inter-agency taskforce to provide support to foreign workers, dormitory operatorsRelated StoryCoronavirus: Workers describe crowded, cramped living conditions at dormitory gazetted as isolation areaPolice and Certis officers will be deployed to maintain order at these blocks.""Let's show our support to these workers by welcoming them during this difficult period,"" he added.The Straits Times has contacted MND for more information.","08-04-2020, 01:26 PM", Coronavirus: 21 vacant HDB blocks in Bukit Merah being refurbished to house essential foreign worker
"A forum letter published in Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao that links the COVID-19 outbreak in dormitories to the personal hygiene and living habits of foreign workers shows ""underlying racism"", Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said.""I think the letter reveals some underlying racism ... Because it typecasts an entire group - several hundred thousand of them - as lacking in personal hygiene, on the basis of their background, because they all come from backward countries,"" he said in an interview with Lianhe Zaobao on Friday (Apr 17).Mr Shanmugam also said that the letter is xenophobic and deeply insensitive, and reflected a ""lack of understanding of why we have this transmission of COVID-19 amongst our foreign worker population"".Singapore has seen a spike in its number of COVID-19 cases in recent weeks, with the majority of new cases involving foreign workers from dormitories.On Friday, Singapore reported 623 new infections, of which 558 were linked to foreign worker dormitories.Kranji Lodge 1 on Saturday became the 13th foreign worker dormitory to be gazetted an isolation area, meaning residents will have to be quarantined in their rooms.To date, more than 3,200 of Singapore's 5,050 cases are attributed to foreign worker domitories.The forum letter, published on Apr 13, questioned if foreign workers were to be blamed for the rise in cases, pointing to their eating habits and alleged lack of personal hygiene.Mr Shanmugam, however, said that the number of cases at foreign worker dormitories were primarily due to communal living, pointing out that foreign workers live, work and cook together.""Personal habits are extremely important ¬ñ washing of hands, keeping yourself clean are very important,"" he said.""But when you put people together, when they sleep in the same room, they cook together and they are in close proximity over a long period of time, of course there will be high levels of transmission.""Mr Shanmugam also acknowledged concerns over the living conditions in dormitories, saying that conditions in the newer dormitories were ""quite okay"", while standards in the older ones varied.""As (Manpower) Minister Josephine Teo has said, look, we will fix this up after COVID-19, and we will deal with the older dorms,"" he said.With foreign worker cases expected to continue rising amid aggressive testing, Mr Shanmugam said there is a need to educate people on the reasons.""The circulation is limited, they are in community isolation,"" he said.""The cross-infection from that person to the rest of the community, whether Singaporean or PR, or foreign worker, is extremely minimised through our isolation approaches.""Some people have also expressed concern that foreign domestic workers, because of potential interaction with foreign workers on their days off, could be another group at risk of being infected in large numbers.Current data shows that infection among foreign domestic workers is very low, said Mr Shanmugam.Foreign domestic workers have to comply with circuit breaker measures and must remain in their employers' homes on their rest days.""The evidence so far is that they get the infection from their employers, not from outside,"" he added.Looking at the bigger picture, Mr Shanmugam said Singaporeans have a duty to care for foreign workers and show them empathy, adding that the Government and community have moved to help them.Fifty-seven per cent of Singaporeans have been able to become professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMET) because of foreign workers, he said.""They clean Singapore, they build our HDB flats, they build our buildings, they handle our waste management, they form the base of our economy,"" he added.""And therefore they are helping us build our prosperity.""Mr Shanmugam cautioned Singaporeans against making sweeping statements about foreign workers, even as he acknowledged that racial fault lines run deep.""As Singaporeans, I would say, whether Chinese, Indian or Malay, or Eurasians, others, we are really kind, compassionate, generous people,"" he stated.""We are bigger than the sentiments expressed in that letter.""https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...mugam-12654924","18-04-2020, 12:32 PM"," Zaobao Forum letter on foreign worker dormitory cases reveals 'underlying racism', says Shanmugam"

"A forum letter published in Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao that links the COVID-19 outbreak in dormitories to the personal hygiene and living habits of foreign workers shows ""underlying racism"", Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said.""I think the letter reveals some underlying racism ... Because it typecasts an entire group - several hundred thousand of them - as lacking in personal hygiene, on the basis of their background, because they all come from backward countries,"" he said in an interview with Lianhe Zaobao on Friday (Apr 17).Mr Shanmugam also said that the letter is xenophobic and deeply insensitive, and reflected a ""lack of understanding of why we have this transmission of COVID-19 amongst our foreign worker population"".Singapore has seen a spike in its number of COVID-19 cases in recent weeks, with the majority of new cases involving foreign workers from dormitories.On Friday, Singapore reported 623 new infections, of which 558 were linked to foreign worker dormitories.Kranji Lodge 1 on Saturday became the 13th foreign worker dormitory to be gazetted an isolation area, meaning residents will have to be quarantined in their rooms.To date, more than 3,200 of Singapore's 5,050 cases are attributed to foreign worker domitories.The forum letter, published on Apr 13, questioned if foreign workers were to be blamed for the rise in cases, pointing to their eating habits and alleged lack of personal hygiene.Mr Shanmugam, however, said that the number of cases at foreign worker dormitories were primarily due to communal living, pointing out that foreign workers live, work and cook together.""Personal habits are extremely important ¬ñ washing of hands, keeping yourself clean are very important,"" he said.""But when you put people together, when they sleep in the same room, they cook together and they are in close proximity over a long period of time, of course there will be high levels of transmission.""Mr Shanmugam also acknowledged concerns over the living conditions in dormitories, saying that conditions in the newer dormitories were ""quite okay"", while standards in the older ones varied.""As (Manpower) Minister Josephine Teo has said, look, we will fix this up after COVID-19, and we will deal with the older dorms,"" he said.With foreign worker cases expected to continue rising amid aggressive testing, Mr Shanmugam said there is a need to educate people on the reasons.""The circulation is limited, they are in community isolation,"" he said.""The cross-infection from that person to the rest of the community, whether Singaporean or PR, or foreign worker, is extremely minimised through our isolation approaches.""Some people have also expressed concern that foreign domestic workers, because of potential interaction with foreign workers on their days off, could be another group at risk of being infected in large numbers.Current data shows that infection among foreign domestic workers is very low, said Mr Shanmugam.Foreign domestic workers have to comply with circuit breaker measures and must remain in their employers' homes on their rest days.""The evidence so far is that they get the infection from their employers, not from outside,"" he added.Looking at the bigger picture, Mr Shanmugam said Singaporeans have a duty to care for foreign workers and show them empathy, adding that the Government and community have moved to help them.Fifty-seven per cent of Singaporeans have been able to become professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMET) because of foreign workers, he said.""They clean Singapore, they build our HDB flats, they build our buildings, they handle our waste management, they form the base of our economy,"" he added.""And therefore they are helping us build our prosperity.""Mr Shanmugam cautioned Singaporeans against making sweeping statements about foreign workers, even as he acknowledged that racial fault lines run deep.""As Singaporeans, I would say, whether Chinese, Indian or Malay, or Eurasians, others, we are really kind, compassionate, generous people,"" he stated.""We are bigger than the sentiments expressed in that letter.""https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...mugam-12654924huh?  indians dont bring in the virus.  its the chinese.  so why blame FW?","18-04-2020, 02:08 PM"," Zaobao Forum letter on foreign worker dormitory cases reveals 'underlying racism', says Shanmugam"

"Weighing Singapore's response to the Covid-19 pandemicDid Singapore overlook Covid-19 cases in foreign worker dormitories; give wrong advice on mask-wearing; and is it too lax in its circuit breaker measures?https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion...id-19-pandemicThe plaudits had come early for Singapore in its fight against the coronavirus.Around the world, epidemiologists and media reports held the country up as a model to emulate for bringing the outbreak under control with a strategy of aggressive testing, meticulous contact tracing and strict isolation.Yet, from being hailed by some as the ""gold standard"" in tackling the virus, the Republic is now referred to by others as a ""cautionary tale"" of how potent the coronavirus is as well as the risks of easing up on measures to contain it.This has led some to question the approach taken in recent weeks: Did the Government overlook the situation in the dormitories? Should mask-wearing have been mandated from the start? Could an earlier and stricter lockdown have prevented the current situation?Often, this is done with 20/20 hindsight. But with what is known about the virus being debunked week to week and the situation evolving daily, it is normal for people to feel uncertain and wonder if the authorities have got it right.BLINDSIDED BY BUGThe most pressing situation now is the one playing out in the purpose-built mega dormitories and factory-converted dorms housing over 320,000 of the 720,000 foreign work permit holders (excluding foreign domestic workers).An explosive growth in Covid-19 cases in these compounds has led to 19 of them being declared isolation zones as of Monday, while all other purpose-built accommodations housing foreign workers have been placed under partial lockdowns.Yesterday alone, close to 1,100 cases were recorded among foreign workers, and health experts warn that if the spread is not curtailed fast, deaths will almost be certain, and hospitals will be overstretched.Could this disaster have been prevented? Some critics believe so.The workers sleep 12 to 20 to a room, with even larger numbers sharing facilities like bathrooms and kitchens, and migrant worker groups have lobbied for better living conditions for years.On March 23, Transient Workers Count Too, or TWC2, had warned of a cluster possibly breaking out, given that the workers live in such close quarters that it is impossible to practise safe distancing.The non-governmental group had alluded to how this could be averted - it would require the rehousing of hundreds of thousands of workers. But it acknowledged that it is unrealistic for additional dormitories to be built in mere weeks or months.With attention at the time focused elsewhere, especially with the flurry of Singaporeans returning home from abroad having to be kept apart from the rest of the population to prevent the spread of the virus, it is doubtful that the public would have appreciated the need to peremptorily expend huge resources to rehouse workers from dormitories at the time.Yet, in the recent weeks alone, thousands of workers have had to be moved out of dormitories and into alternative housing at military camps, floating hotels and vacant Housing Board blocks, with more areas such as sports facilities and hotels set to be converted for such use.So inevitably the question has arisen of whether it could have been done before the super spreading event at Mustafa Centre seeded the infections in the dormitories.Several factors may have informed the decision to manage outbreaks as they happen, say experts.The first Covid-19 cases involving foreign workers in February had been successfully contained, and never ""exploded into big clusters"", in the words of Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry coronavirus task force.Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said this suggests that responses put in place such as testing, contact tracing and isolating cases were adequate.Also, precautions were already being taken at the compounds, with temperature checks, increased cleaning of shared spaces, and hand sanitisers for workers to use.Prof Teo said the current crisis at the dormitories was the result of what epidemiologists call a super spreading event that is difficult to predict.""This is what we mean by a very unfortunate event that, in hindsight, people will say we should have known,"" he added.Such events have driven epidemics and once they happen, it is crucial to quickly recognise and understand them to arrest the spread.On this count, Nanyang Technological University's Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine visiting professor Annelies Wilder-Smith believes the Government is on the right track in thinning out the dorms. But she warned that it is now a race against time and the infection could ""spread like a fire, and Singapore has to move faster than the speed of the virus"".At the same time, gazetting the worst-hit dorms as isolation areas is necessary to keep the infection from spilling over into the general population.Prof Teo cautioned that this should not be misconstrued as ""discrimination"", adding that such a classical public health response was also employed in Hong Kong during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic, when an entire apartment block had to be closed off.As long as workers are also being cared for and protected in the dorms, this is probably the best way to control the dormitory outbreak, said Professor Wilder-Smith.Both experts said that a lesson to take away from this is that the spread of Covid-19 can quickly go out of control in situations where people live side by side, not just in dormitories, but also in old folks' homes.TO MASK OR NOT?Another issue that is hotly debated now is whether the Government was wrong to urge people not to wear masks in the initial phase of the outbreak.Then, ministers had discouraged people from using masks, citing advice from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other experts on the Sars-CoV-2 virus being spread through droplets and not aerosols.Officials also noted that in the light of a global shortage, it was best to conserve the use of such protective gear to ensure that it is available to medical professionals when they need it to care for patients.As more became known about the disease, the Government has in the past weeks changed its stance, distributing reusable masks to everyone and mandating the wearing of masks in public. While the WHO has maintained that healthy people do not need to wear masks, officials have acknowledged that it may become common practice.Some have called it a flip-flop.Others have attributed the rise in cases in Singapore to people not wearing masks, pointing to how in places like Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, where the practice is commonplace, the numbers of infections have been kept low.But experts point out that these regions have also espoused other key public health responses to the pandemic such as rigorous testing, comprehensive contact tracing and strict isolationHas not wearing masks been detrimental here?Prof Teo said this is not borne out by the data on community transmission.Up until March 24, there had mostly been fewer than 10 cases of such transmissions a day, he said, adding that the numbers would have spiked by February had the limited use of masks been a big factor. With such small numbers of infected people roaming around in the community, the chances of people catching the disease when going about their daily life were also small, and there was thus no need for the widespread adoption of masks early on, he added.He likened the wearing of surgical masks in the early days to people wearing motorcycle helmets everywhere they go.""Does the helmet protect one from head injury? The answer is yes. But why does one not wear it to, say, FairPrice to shop? Because we perceive our risk of getting a head injury from grocery shopping to be very low,"" he said.""Similarly, when there is very little transmission, wearing a face mask is similar to wearing a motorcycle helmet while buying groceries. We need to manage or perceive risk in an objective way.""With a shortage of N95 respirators and surgical masks worldwide, experts believe that every country's priority should be to maintain inventories of such protective equipment for doctors, nurses and first responders.If healthcare workers get infected or die in large numbers, healthcare systems will collapse, causing panic in society.Thus, encouraging the use of masks has to be balanced with the preservation of the limited resource. If three-quarters of the 5.6 million people here use just two surgical masks a day, Singapore will expend more than 58.8 million masks a week.Now, with scientists discovering that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infected people might unwittingly spread the virus, the advice on mask-wearing has changed, and people are encouraged to wear a reusable mask in public so as to protect others.Ironically, it has been an uphill task to get everyone to comply, and it has not been hard to spot people without masks in public.LAISSEZ-FAIRE LOCKDOWN?The third issue is whether an earlier and more complete lockdown would have helped Singapore avoid the current situation, where daily Covid-19 cases have breached the 1,000 mark.From the get-go, Singapore has taken a calibrated approach to managing the outbreak, with measures changing as the situation evolved.While testing, contact tracing and quarantining have been a constant, the Government has preferred a proportionate response in implementing safe distancing measures gradually, instead of having a more draconian total lockdown.For some, this calibrated approach, with rules changing on a daily basis, has seemed wishy-washy and confusing.If Singapore had taken a more cut and dried approach, imposed a police-enforced lockdown with curfews and stopped public transport as some countries have done, could it have eradicated the virus?Debate on this topic has intensified as lockdowns take their toll on economies and public life around the world, and countries contemplate the loosening of restrictions to allow some modicum of normal life to resume.Ironically, some commentators were citing Singapore as the model of what a less stringent lockdown might look like. With the surge in numbers now, Singapore is also pointed to as an example of the risks that premature easing up might entail, making it plain that no easy, one-size-fits-all solution exists for this very unusual outbreak.Prof Wilder-Smith believes that for some countries like Singapore and New Zealand, completely locking down is possible and can potentially bring infections to zero.But she added that this would include ringfencing the country from even its own citizens who are overseas and want to return.Also, such a total lockdown would have to be maintained for some time for infections to be kept out, as the world has missed the boat on containment and infections can easily be reintroduced once Singapore opens its borders.""Four weeks ago, I would say every country should go for containment. But worldwide, we have missed that chance,"" Prof Wilder-Smith said. ""If it's one or two weeks, we will all gladly do it. But we don't know how long this situation will last and a total lockdown can mean long-term suffering with very strict restrictions for months and months to come, which also causes major damage.""As for an earlier lockdown, Prof Teo said data in the early days did not justify it.A lockdown reduces physical interaction and helps to break chains of transmission. But with the number of cases spreading in the community in the double digits daily at most, a lockdown would have been akin to using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, bringing unneeded disruption to life when cases could have been controlled through strategies like contact tracing, testing and isolation.Elsewhere, in Wuhan, where the virus had first emerged, and in Italy, one of the worst-hit European countries so far, lockdowns substantially reduced the number of new cases for a time.But experts now agree that it is mostly a delaying tactic, and believe that cases will rebound when the restrictions are lifted.So far, lockdowns are estimated to cost a staggering total of US$7.8 trillion (S$11.2 trillion) worldwide. In Singapore, the economic toll of the current partial lockdown is predicted to be around $10 billion. As people work from home and children stay away from school, there have also been more reports of domestic abuse and mental health issues.After just 15 days of the circuit breaking period in Singapore, there are also signs of ""lockdown fatigue"", with people venturing out and crowding the only places where they are now allowed to visit such as supermarkets and parks.This is why governments around the world have struggled to find the right balance between imposing strict restrictions to resolve the pandemic and not causing irreversible harm to the economy and society.At the same time, for a calibrated approach to work, rules have to be kept simple. For now, caveats and exemptions for mask-wearing and enlisting the help of grandparents for childcare support, for instance, have caused confusion and led to non-compliance.LONG ROAD AHEADIn an interview with CNN on March 29, when asked about Singapore's success, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had cautioned against complacency, pointing to a long road ahead, as other ministers had also done. Indeed, several had said early on that the outbreak could last into 2021, raising some eyebrows at the time.""I hesitate to talk about success because we are right in the midst of a battle which is intensifying,"" said PM Lee. ""With great effort, I think it (Singapore's measures) has helped to keep the number of cases down, but I am under no illusions that we have won. We are just going in, and there is a long battle ahead.""His words have rung true and Singapore is in the news again, this time as a cautionary tale.Harvard University professor of epidemiology Marc Lipsitch, who had praised Singapore's approach in a research paper, said, when asked, that while Singapore has done admirably well in how long it was able to maintain a degree of control while keeping up significant economic activity, he never believed with certainty that the epidemic would be kept under control here.He told The Straits Times: ""But I see the failure of containment after a significant period of time as reflecting the strong challenges of this virus (even more than Sars, for example) rather than the failure of any specific location.""Prof Wilder-Smith said: ""So Singapore looked good three weeks ago and not so now... We should not be too early in making judgments and should maybe wait until the end to compare.""With scientists predicting that lockdowns might have to last until next year, and new information indicating that recovering from the infection may not confer immunity for long, governments will have to be careful about allowing hubris or complacency to set in while a vaccine is being developed.This is yet another fine balancing act.Prof Teo said: ""Definitely we should not be arrogant and we should not be mocking the efforts of other countries... Equally, it does not mean Singapore is arrogant or smug if we share our experiences with other countries.""In a crisis faced by the whole world, sharing those experiences becomes crucially important as a case study of what has worked and what hasn't.""","22-04-2020, 10:23 AM", Weighing Singapore's response to the Covid-19 pandemic

If you close schools, what¬ís the trigger to reopen them?In Singapore, we want life to go on as normal. We want businesses, churches, restaurants and schools to stay open. This is what success looks like. Everything goes forward with modifications as needed, and you keep doing this until there¬ís a vaccine or a treatment.On testing, the threshold for getting a test is pretty low. For the first week, we tested only people from Wuhan or Hubei province, then we tested anyone who had been in China within the last 14 days.By the end of January, all of our public hospitals could do tests. Then we moved to enhanced screening ¬ñ we tested anyone coming to a hospital with a respiratory illness, anyone who had been in contact with a COVID-19 patient.Now, it¬ís even become more liberal. If you¬íre a hospital staff member with a mild cold, we¬íll give you a test.But if you¬íre a normal person with no contacts with anybody and mild symptoms, we¬íd just send them home. You can get a medical certificate that allows you to stay home from work for five days. If you are a casual worker, there¬ís financial help with that, too.","26-04-2020, 12:11 PM", Fewer COVID-19 tests are being conducted in foreign worker dormitories with higher infection rates

Full genome sequences of the new virus were shared with WHO and the international community immediately after the pathogen was identified on 7 January. On 10 January, an expert group involving Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwanese technical experts and a World Health Organization team was invited to visit Wuhan. A set of nucleic acid primers and probes for PCR detection for COVID-19 was released on 21 JanuaryQuote:The Joint Mission consisted of 25 national and international experts from China, Germany, Japan, Korea, Nigeria, Russia, Singapore, the United States of America and the World Health Organization (WHO). The Joint Mission was headed by Dr Bruce Aylward of WHO and Dr Wannian Liang of the People¬ís Republic of China. The full list of members and their affiliations is available in Annex A. The Joint Mission was implemented over a 9-day period from 16-24 February 2020. The schedule of work is available in Annex B.Quote:Asymptomatic infection has been reported, but the majority of the relatively rare cases who are asymptomatic on the date of identification/report went on to develop disease. The proportion of truly asymptomatic infections is unclear but appears to be relatively rare and does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.Quote:Specimens from both the upper respiratory tract (URT; nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and lower respiratory tract (LRT; expectorated sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage) are collected for COVID-19 testing by PCR. COVID-19 virus has been detected in respiratory, fecal and blood specimens. According to preliminary data from Guangzhou CDC as of 20 February, virus can initially be detected inupper respiratory samples 1-2 days prior to symptom onset and persist for 7-12 days in moderate cases and up to 2 weeks in severe cases. Viral RNA has been detected in feces in up to 30% of patients from day 5 following onset of symptoms and has been noted for up to 4-5 weeks in moderate cases. However, it is not clear whether this correlates with the presence of infectious virus. While live virus has been cultured from stool in some cases, the role of fecal-oral transmission is not yet well understood. COVID-19 has been isolated from the clinical specimens using human airway epithelial cells, Vero E6 and Huh-7 cell lines.Quote:Patients are discharged after clinical recovery (afebrile >3 days, resolution of symptoms and radiologic improvement) and 2 negative PCR tests taken 24 hours apart. Upon discharge, they are asked to minimise family and social contact and to wear a mask. There are expectations of clinical trial results within a matter of weeks, which will see furtheropportunities for treatment.Quote:A.

"Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo on Tuesday (Apr 14) thanked foreign workers for their hard work in Singapore and their cooperation as the country fights to curb the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak.In a video, Mrs Teo extended her Tamil New Year greetings to foreign workers in Singapore, wishing them good health.""Today is the start of the new year for you, but it is difficult to celebrate without family and friends,"" said Mrs Teo in the video.""The COVID-19 outbreak has affected all of us, but I know it is especially hard for you. I want to thank you for all your hard work in Singapore and for your cooperation during this period.""On behalf of all Singaporeans, I wish you good health in the new year. Stay safe for your families, stay safe for your friends,"" she said.Ministry of Communications and Information of Mr Iswaran, who also appeared in the video, also paid tribute to foreign workers for their contribution to Singapore¬ís development and growth.Amid COVID-19, Mr Iswaran said he understood the foreign workers¬í concerns about their wages and that is why the government is working with their employers to ensure that they will continue to be paid in this period.¬ìWe are also making arrangements to ensure that you get the necessary healthcare and also the services for food and for your accommodation, and also for the larger needs in terms of IT and Wi-Fi connectivity so that you can stay connected to your families,¬î he added.Singapore has put in place strict safe distancing measures during what it calls a circuit breaker period to stem the spread of COVID-19. The measures - which include shutting down non-essential workplaces and schools - will be in place for one month until May 4.A large number of Singapore's recent COVID-19 cases have been from foreign worker dormitories.Several dormitories have been declared as isolation areas, meaning residents have to be quarantined in their rooms.Concerns have been raised about the welfare of foreign workers in dormitories, and the ability of dorm operators to implement COVID-19 safe distancing measures, with photos and videos circulating online of crowded and unsanitary conditions.The Ministry of Manpower has since stepped in to help manage the situation - saying it has ensured better distribution and quality of meals, as well as improved waste management and hygiene conditions.Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said on Sunday that the Government has short-term and long-term plans in place to improve conditions at foreign worker dormitories.In the immediate term, the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force has set up a special group to look at the measures needed for foreign worker dormitories, said Mr Heng.This includes raising standards of cleanliness and hygiene and reducing the concentration of foreign workers in the dormitories, said Mr Heng, adding that authorities are looking into housing foreign workers in other facilities.Mr Iswaran said on Tuesday that the implementation of circuit breaker measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 had imposed much inconvenience and challenges for all, but that it was important for everyone to work together.¬ìIt is important that all of us whether we are citizens, permanent residents, or workers from overseas like you, that we all come together and do our part so that we can overcome this challenge,¬î he said.He wished them a Happy New Year, Happy Vishu and Happy Vaisakhi.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...vid19-12638796","14-04-2020, 11:28 AM", 'Thank you for all your hard work': Josephine Teo thanks Singapore's foreign workers in Tamil New Ye

"https://www.moh.gov.sg/news-highligh...er-dormitories5TH APR 2020    The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) had issued advisories on enhanced precautionary measures in dormitories to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission. However transmissions within foreign worker dormitories have continued to rise and we are seeing more confirmed cases and workers who are ill. The S11 Dormitory @ Punggol (2 Seletar North Link) and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory (18 Toh Guan Road East) are of particular concern.2.    The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has decided that further measures are necessary to contain the risk of further transmission among the foreign workers within these two dormitories. This would keep the workers safe, as well as protect the wider community from widespread transmission from these clusters. Both S11 Dormitory @ Punggol and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory have been declared as isolation areas. Onsite medical support has been deployed, along with provision of food and essential supplies.Measures to contain further outbreak3.    The S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, with 13,000 resident workers, and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory, with 6,800 resident workers, have been gazetted as isolation areas. Given the rising number of confirmed cases, this is necessary to avoid the risk of further transmissions from any potentially infected workers to others in the dormitories, as well as into the community. Workers who are symptomatic have already been isolated.4.    Within these two dormitories, precautionary steps have also been taken to protect workers who are well. All the affected workers will not go to work. Access to recreational facilities will be regulated to reduce the inter-mixing of workers. Movement between blocks is prohibited. Workers have also been advised to cease social interactions with others who do not reside in the same room or floor.5.    MOM is working closely with all dormitory operators, to implement similar measures within their premises with immediate effect. Efforts are also underway in the larger dormitories to reduce the density of their resident workers, by transferring some among them to alternative accommodation during this period.Support provided to workers6.    The workers will continue to be paid their salaries for the duration of the quarantine. Their period of absence from work is treated as paid hospitalisation leave as part of the worker¬ís leave eligibility under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA). Their employers are eligible to claim for the $100 daily quarantine allowance.7.    Arrangements will be made to cater three meals a day for all affected workers for the duration of the quarantine. They will also be issued with reusable masks, surgical masks, thermometers, hand sanitisers and other essentials so they can keep themselves safe and comfortable.8.    Onsite medical support has been deployed to support the workers residing at both dormitories. The dormitories have also implemented enhanced health screening measures, such as requiring workers to check and report their temperature twice daily, as well as the regular monitoring for fever and respiratory symptoms. Those who are unwell will be isolated and will be assessed by medical personnel for further attention. Support provided to companies with affected workers9.    Companies that are providing essential services with workers affected by this quarantine order will be supported and arrangements will be made to ensure these essential services can continue to be provided.Advisory to dormitory operators10.   Dormitory operators and workers living in dormitories are reminded of the importance of maintaining high standards of hygiene and cleanliness to safeguard their own health and those of others who are living in the same space. Safe distancing measures must be strictly adhered to. These include measures such as no inter-mixing of workers between dormitory blocks and floors, and for workers to stay within their rooms and to minimise interactions.11.   Social responsibility is critical in slowing the transmission of the virus. We need every individual to play their part in the fight against the virus. Those who are unwell, even with mild flu-like symptoms, should not be at work. They must see a doctor immediately to prevent spreading illness to others.MINISTRY OF HEALTH & MINISTRY OF MANPOWER5 APRIL 2020","05-04-2020, 07:51 PM", [05-04-2020] 120 new cases of COVID-19 infection confirmed

These include measures such as no inter-mixing of workers between dormitory blocks and floors, and for workers to stay within their rooms and to minimise interactions.11.   Social responsibility is critical in slowing the transmission of the virus. We need every individual to play their part in the fight against the virus. Those who are unwell, even with mild flu-like symptoms, should not be at work. They must see a doctor immediately to prevent spreading illness to others.MINISTRY OF HEALTH & MINISTRY OF MANPOWER5 APRIL 2020MOH think they can outrun the virus with such half-f**ked reactive measures......how wrong they are.....","05-04-2020, 07:53 PM", [05-04-2020] 120 new cases of COVID-19 infection confirmed

Besides for construction I think only if it's critical public infrastructure or like tunneling works to come to a safe stop are allowed to carry on.The past few days had saw new clusters of worker's dormitories and construction sites. I believe this type of triple digit daily figures will be sustained till a more drastic lockdown is announced.

"Gold standard no more? Singapore¬ís response to the Covid-19 outbreak begins to tarnishhttp://theindependent.sg/gold-standa...ns-to-tarnish/Singapore¬óOnce considered the ¬ìgold standard¬î by many nations for its measures to address the coronavirus outbreak, the Singaporean Government is now facing criticism due to the rising number of local cases confirmed for Covid-19, as well as other issues that have recently surfaced, including poor living conditions at foreign workers¬í dormitories, where 70 percent of new coronavirus cases are linked.Activists previously sounded the alarm that the overcrowded dormitories of migrant workers would be a threat to public health, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reports.Singapore¬ís foreign workers¬í dormitories are home to around 200,000 individuals employed in construction and other industries. Medical and logistics staff have been assigned to man outbreaks in these dormitories, and a new task force for the specific purpose of looking after the migrant workers was formed, headed by Teo Chee Hean, Singapore¬ís senior minister in charge of security.PM Lee assured the public in a video message posted on social media last week that the well-being of the foreign workers would be attended to.¬ìWe have worked with their employers to make sure they will be paid their salaries, and can remit money home. We will provide them with the medical care and treatment they need,¬î he added.However, others wonder if these measures could have been implemented earlier. Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), a workers¬í rights group, had written a letter to The Straits Times (ST) on March 23, asking the Government to disclose their plan of action in case a mass infection should break out in the dormitories of migrant workers, which would assure the ¬ìresident and non-resident community.¬îWhile the issue of the welfare of migrant workers is not a new one, it has galvanized many Singaporeans into action, and more and more have commented on it, giving rise to a national debate.Veteran Tommy Koh wrote on Monday (Apr 7) that ¬ìthe way Singapore treats its foreign workers is not First World but Third World,¬î in response to an ST article concerning the unhygienic and overcrowded conditions in foreign workers¬í dormitories, while social media influencer and YouTube comic Preeti Nair, more popularly known as Preetipls, in six days raised more than twice the goal amount of $100,000 she had aimed to donate to HealthServe and TWC2 to help migrant workers.Local activist for foreign worker communities Kokila Annamalai took to Facebook to highlight the poor quality of meals the quarantined migrant workers had been receiving, with many netizens are taking up the same cry. Ms Kokila compared the meals the foreign workers were receiving to the ones that expatriates serving Stay Home Notices in posh hotels were being given. Within a day, Ms Kokila took to social media again to say the quality of the food had improved.Veteran journalist PN Balji wrote in a commentary on Friday (Apr 10), ¬ìHow quickly fortunes can turn. It was only a few weeks ago that Singapore was smelling like roses with the country being praised, both here and abroad, for its efficient handling of the COVID-19 crisis. Today, the same government is struggling to contain the quick spread of the virus as dormitories for migrant workers open up a new battlefront.¬î","19-04-2020, 05:42 PM", Gold standard no more?

"Weighing Singapore's response to the Covid-19 pandemicDid Singapore overlook Covid-19 cases in foreign worker dormitories; give wrong advice on mask-wearing; and is it too lax in its circuit breaker measures?https://www.straitstimes.com/opinion...id-19-pandemicThe plaudits had come early for Singapore in its fight against the coronavirus.Around the world, epidemiologists and media reports held the country up as a model to emulate for bringing the outbreak under control with a strategy of aggressive testing, meticulous contact tracing and strict isolation.Yet, from being hailed by some as the ""gold standard"" in tackling the virus, the Republic is now referred to by others as a ""cautionary tale"" of how potent the coronavirus is as well as the risks of easing up on measures to contain it.This has led some to question the approach taken in recent weeks: Did the Government overlook the situation in the dormitories? Should mask-wearing have been mandated from the start? Could an earlier and stricter lockdown have prevented the current situation?Often, this is done with 20/20 hindsight. But with what is known about the virus being debunked week to week and the situation evolving daily, it is normal for people to feel uncertain and wonder if the authorities have got it right.BLINDSIDED BY BUGThe most pressing situation now is the one playing out in the purpose-built mega dormitories and factory-converted dorms housing over 320,000 of the 720,000 foreign work permit holders (excluding foreign domestic workers).An explosive growth in Covid-19 cases in these compounds has led to 19 of them being declared isolation zones as of Monday, while all other purpose-built accommodations housing foreign workers have been placed under partial lockdowns.Yesterday alone, close to 1,100 cases were recorded among foreign workers, and health experts warn that if the spread is not curtailed fast, deaths will almost be certain, and hospitals will be overstretched.Could this disaster have been prevented? Some critics believe so.The workers sleep 12 to 20 to a room, with even larger numbers sharing facilities like bathrooms and kitchens, and migrant worker groups have lobbied for better living conditions for years.On March 23, Transient Workers Count Too, or TWC2, had warned of a cluster possibly breaking out, given that the workers live in such close quarters that it is impossible to practise safe distancing.The non-governmental group had alluded to how this could be averted - it would require the rehousing of hundreds of thousands of workers. But it acknowledged that it is unrealistic for additional dormitories to be built in mere weeks or months.With attention at the time focused elsewhere, especially with the flurry of Singaporeans returning home from abroad having to be kept apart from the rest of the population to prevent the spread of the virus, it is doubtful that the public would have appreciated the need to peremptorily expend huge resources to rehouse workers from dormitories at the time.Yet, in the recent weeks alone, thousands of workers have had to be moved out of dormitories and into alternative housing at military camps, floating hotels and vacant Housing Board blocks, with more areas such as sports facilities and hotels set to be converted for such use.So inevitably the question has arisen of whether it could have been done before the super spreading event at Mustafa Centre seeded the infections in the dormitories.Several factors may have informed the decision to manage outbreaks as they happen, say experts.The first Covid-19 cases involving foreign workers in February had been successfully contained, and never ""exploded into big clusters"", in the words of Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry coronavirus task force.Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said this suggests that responses put in place such as testing, contact tracing and isolating cases were adequate.Also, precautions were already being taken at the compounds, with temperature checks, increased cleaning of shared spaces, and hand sanitisers for workers to use.Prof Teo said the current crisis at the dormitories was the result of what epidemiologists call a super spreading event that is difficult to predict.""This is what we mean by a very unfortunate event that, in hindsight, people will say we should have known,"" he added.Such events have driven epidemics and once they happen, it is crucial to quickly recognise and understand them to arrest the spread.On this count, Nanyang Technological University's Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine visiting professor Annelies Wilder-Smith believes the Government is on the right track in thinning out the dorms. But she warned that it is now a race against time and the infection could ""spread like a fire, and Singapore has to move faster than the speed of the virus"".At the same time, gazetting the worst-hit dorms as isolation areas is necessary to keep the infection from spilling over into the general population.Prof Teo cautioned that this should not be misconstrued as ""discrimination"", adding that such a classical public health response was also employed in Hong Kong during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic, when an entire apartment block had to be closed off.As long as workers are also being cared for and protected in the dorms, this is probably the best way to control the dormitory outbreak, said Professor Wilder-Smith.Both experts said that a lesson to take away from this is that the spread of Covid-19 can quickly go out of control in situations where people live side by side, not just in dormitories, but also in old folks' homes.TO MASK OR NOT?Another issue that is hotly debated now is whether the Government was wrong to urge people not to wear masks in the initial phase of the outbreak.Then, ministers had discouraged people from using masks, citing advice from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other experts on the Sars-CoV-2 virus being spread through droplets and not aerosols.Officials also noted that in the light of a global shortage, it was best to conserve the use of such protective gear to ensure that it is available to medical professionals when they need it to care for patients.As more became known about the disease, the Government has in the past weeks changed its stance, distributing reusable masks to everyone and mandating the wearing of masks in public. While the WHO has maintained that healthy people do not need to wear masks, officials have acknowledged that it may become common practice.Some have called it a flip-flop.Others have attributed the rise in cases in Singapore to people not wearing masks, pointing to how in places like Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, where the practice is commonplace, the numbers of infections have been kept low.But experts point out that these regions have also espoused other key public health responses to the pandemic such as rigorous testing, comprehensive contact tracing and strict isolationHas not wearing masks been detrimental here?Prof Teo said this is not borne out by the data on community transmission.Up until March 24, there had mostly been fewer than 10 cases of such transmissions a day, he said, adding that the numbers would have spiked by February had the limited use of masks been a big factor. With such small numbers of infected people roaming around in the community, the chances of people catching the disease when going about their daily life were also small, and there was thus no need for the widespread adoption of masks early on, he added.He likened the wearing of surgical masks in the early days to people wearing motorcycle helmets everywhere they go.""Does the helmet protect one from head injury? The answer is yes. But why does one not wear it to, say, FairPrice to shop? Because we perceive our risk of getting a head injury from grocery shopping to be very low,"" he said.""Similarly, when there is very little transmission, wearing a face mask is similar to wearing a motorcycle helmet while buying groceries. We need to manage or perceive risk in an objective way.""With a shortage of N95 respirators and surgical masks worldwide, experts believe that every country's priority should be to maintain inventories of such protective equipment for doctors, nurses and first responders.If healthcare workers get infected or die in large numbers, healthcare systems will collapse, causing panic in society.Thus, encouraging the use of masks has to be balanced with the preservation of the limited resource. If three-quarters of the 5.6 million people here use just two surgical masks a day, Singapore will expend more than 58.8 million masks a week.Now, with scientists discovering that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infected people might unwittingly spread the virus, the advice on mask-wearing has changed, and people are encouraged to wear a reusable mask in public so as to protect others.Ironically, it has been an uphill task to get everyone to comply, and it has not been hard to spot people without masks in public.LAISSEZ-FAIRE LOCKDOWN?The third issue is whether an earlier and more complete lockdown would have helped Singapore avoid the current situation, where daily Covid-19 cases have breached the 1,000 mark.From the get-go, Singapore has taken a calibrated approach to managing the outbreak, with measures changing as the situation evolved.While testing, contact tracing and quarantining have been a constant, the Government has preferred a proportionate response in implementing safe distancing measures gradually, instead of having a more draconian total lockdown.For some, this calibrated approach, with rules changing on a daily basis, has seemed wishy-washy and confusing.If Singapore had taken a more cut and dried approach, imposed a police-enforced lockdown with curfews and stopped public transport as some countries have done, could it have eradicated the virus?Debate on this topic has intensified as lockdowns take their toll on economies and public life around the world, and countries contemplate the loosening of restrictions to allow some modicum of normal life to resume.Ironically, some commentators were citing Singapore as the model of what a less stringent lockdown might look like. With the surge in numbers now, Singapore is also pointed to as an example of the risks that premature easing up might entail, making it plain that no easy, one-size-fits-all solution exists for this very unusual outbreak.Prof Wilder-Smith believes that for some countries like Singapore and New Zealand, completely locking down is possible and can potentially bring infections to zero.But she added that this would include ringfencing the country from even its own citizens who are overseas and want to return.Also, such a total lockdown would have to be maintained for some time for infections to be kept out, as the world has missed the boat on containment and infections can easily be reintroduced once Singapore opens its borders.""Four weeks ago, I would say every country should go for containment. But worldwide, we have missed that chance,"" Prof Wilder-Smith said. ""If it's one or two weeks, we will all gladly do it. But we don't know how long this situation will last and a total lockdown can mean long-term suffering with very strict restrictions for months and months to come, which also causes major damage.""As for an earlier lockdown, Prof Teo said data in the early days did not justify it.A lockdown reduces physical interaction and helps to break chains of transmission. But with the number of cases spreading in the community in the double digits daily at most, a lockdown would have been akin to using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, bringing unneeded disruption to life when cases could have been controlled through strategies like contact tracing, testing and isolation.Elsewhere, in Wuhan, where the virus had first emerged, and in Italy, one of the worst-hit European countries so far, lockdowns substantially reduced the number of new cases for a time.But experts now agree that it is mostly a delaying tactic, and believe that cases will rebound when the restrictions are lifted.So far, lockdowns are estimated to cost a staggering total of US$7.8 trillion (S$11.2 trillion) worldwide. In Singapore, the economic toll of the current partial lockdown is predicted to be around $10 billion. As people work from home and children stay away from school, there have also been more reports of domestic abuse and mental health issues.After just 15 days of the circuit breaking period in Singapore, there are also signs of ""lockdown fatigue"", with people venturing out and crowding the only places where they are now allowed to visit such as supermarkets and parks.This is why governments around the world have struggled to find the right balance between imposing strict restrictions to resolve the pandemic and not causing irreversible harm to the economy and society.At the same time, for a calibrated approach to work, rules have to be kept simple. For now, caveats and exemptions for mask-wearing and enlisting the help of grandparents for childcare support, for instance, have caused confusion and led to non-compliance.LONG ROAD AHEADIn an interview with CNN on March 29, when asked about Singapore's success, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had cautioned against complacency, pointing to a long road ahead, as other ministers had also done. Indeed, several had said early on that the outbreak could last into 2021, raising some eyebrows at the time.""I hesitate to talk about success because we are right in the midst of a battle which is intensifying,"" said PM Lee. ""With great effort, I think it (Singapore's measures) has helped to keep the number of cases down, but I am under no illusions that we have won. We are just going in, and there is a long battle ahead.""His words have rung true and Singapore is in the news again, this time as a cautionary tale.Harvard University professor of epidemiology Marc Lipsitch, who had praised Singapore's approach in a research paper, said, when asked, that while Singapore has done admirably well in how long it was able to maintain a degree of control while keeping up significant economic activity, he never believed with certainty that the epidemic would be kept under control here.He told The Straits Times: ""But I see the failure of containment after a significant period of time as reflecting the strong challenges of this virus (even more than Sars, for example) rather than the failure of any specific location.""Prof Wilder-Smith said: ""So Singapore looked good three weeks ago and not so now... We should not be too early in making judgments and should maybe wait until the end to compare.""With scientists predicting that lockdowns might have to last until next year, and new information indicating that recovering from the infection may not confer immunity for long, governments will have to be careful about allowing hubris or complacency to set in while a vaccine is being developed.This is yet another fine balancing act.Prof Teo said: ""Definitely we should not be arrogant and we should not be mocking the efforts of other countries... Equally, it does not mean Singapore is arrogant or smug if we share our experiences with other countries.""In a crisis faced by the whole world, sharing those experiences becomes crucially important as a case study of what has worked and what hasn't.""","22-04-2020, 10:23 AM", Weighing Singapore's response to the Covid-19 pandemic

"Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said: ""First of all, now (FDWs) can't go out, and second, when you drill down on the data, the rate of infection among foreign domestic workers is very low.""The evidence we have so far is that they get the infection from their employers, not from outside.""Hmmm... MOH says ""most"". Shan said something else.I beg to differ. I actually believe nowadays the biggest group of potential virus carriers out there are the FW. They are the ones that have least concern abt getting infected by the virus cos they don't have a family in here, so no need to worry about spreading the virus to their family members. The mortality of covid19 is still low, so it's like someone said b4 ""get it and then recover"".

"https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2020/04/20/foreign-worker-dormitory-linked-to-grassroots-gains-70m-in-valuation-after-govt-approves-redevelopment-plan-on-10-feb/new COVID-19 cases in Singapore hit a new record of 1,426  with the total number of infected cases exceeding 8,000.As of yesterday, Singapore has highest number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in South-East Asia.Of the 1,426 new cases, ¬ìvast majority¬î of the new cases are work permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in its media release of preliminary figures.As of 20 April, there are a total of 18 foreign worker dormitories that have been declared as isolation areas.As reported earlier, Westlite dormitories are run by public listed company Centurion Corporation who is helmed by Potong Pasir grassroots leaders: David Loh Kim Kang and Han Seng Juan (¬ëForeign worker dormitories with active COVID-19 clusters linked to PA grassroots leaders¬ë, 10 Apr).According to its website, Centurion Corporation currently operates 5 foreign worker dormitories:Westlite Toh Guan and Westlite Mandai have been gazetted as isolated area while Westlite Woodlands has been identified by MOH as a cluster.SLA extends dorm lease and Centurion doesn¬ít have to pay development premiumIn any case, 2 months ago (14 Feb), Centurion Corporation announced that it has obtained approval from the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) on 10 Feb for the redevelopment of an existing block at Westlite Toh Guan dormitory to an 8 storey workers dormitory and industrial training centre. It said the company has obtained planning permission from the URA in relation to the redevelopment project.Also, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) would issue the company an offer to regularise the title restriction so as to reflect the approved use of the property as a worker dormitory, training centre and ancillary commercial use.SLA would also extend the use of the existing lease of Westlite Toh Guan by another 25 years from 2032 to 2057. The company said it ¬ìunderstands¬î from SLA that a development premium for the ¬ìintensification of the property¬î is not payable.Westlite Toh Guan dormitory was the first 2 foreign worker dormitories to be gazetted on 5 Apr as isolation areas under the Infectious Diseases Act, after a large surge in the numbers of infected workers were seen in the 2 dormitories.After its announcement on 14 Feb, Centurion Corporation gave a positive profit alert on 18 Feb to the public in relation to the ¬ìgood news¬î it had received from URA and SLA earlier.It said that as the period of use for Westlite Toh Guan is extended by 25 years, the company would gain a fair value uplift on the investment property by S$70 million. It announced that property firm Knight Frank has valued Westlite Toh Guan at S$284 million as at 31 December 2019 giving the revaluation gain of S$70 million or about 33% from the original value.With the valuation gain thanks the redevelopment approvals the company had received from the government, it¬ís not known if it would also help to create a less crowded and better living environment for those foreign workers living in its dormitories.","21-04-2020, 08:28 AM", Foreign worker dorms linked to PAP grassroots gains valuation on 10 Feb

"SINGAPORE ¬ó The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (April 9) announced 287 new cases of Covid-19 in Singapore, with many of the cases traced to Mustafa Centre in Little India.Among the new cases, 219 are linked to foreign worker dormitory clusters containing workers who had visited the mall. Another 19 are linked to other known clusters and three are imported.The latest daily tally marks a new record, and is more than double the highest daily spike of 142 cases seen on Wednesday. This brings the total number of confirmed cases here to 1,910.National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-disciplinary taskforce tackling the coronavirus, said at a media briefing on Thursday that Singapore needs a ¬ìmajor and urgent intervention¬î to fight the spread of Covid-19 among the foreign worker population.ADVERTISEMENTHe noted that the taskforce requires a ¬ìdedicated strategy¬î for foreign workers due to the higher rate of transmission among them, and said it had enlisted the help of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and Singapore Police Force (SPF).The SAF and SPF will form part of a separate inter-agency taskforce, he said.Mr Wong added that the taskforce had also invited Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean to guide it in this strategy, given his familiarity with police work. Mr Teo had previously been Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Defence.As of Wednesday, six people had died from complications due to Covid-19 infection.Speaking on Thursday at the virtual media briefing on the latest cases, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, MOH¬ís director of medical services, said preliminary links have been established between the clusters at Mustafa Centre, a 51-storey mixed-use construction site called Project Glory at Market Street in the central business district and five dormitories ¬ó Tampines Dormitory, S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, Toh Guan Dormitory, Sungei Tengah Lodge and Cochrane Lodge II.¬ìMany of these cases, in fact, started out in the cluster at Mustafa,¬î said Assoc Prof Mak.He added that MOH is now testing foreign workers for Covid-19, as ¬ìmany cases who tested positive were workers who had very mild symptoms and were well¬î.Mr Wong said that it is important for Singapore to realise that it is dealing with two separate infections ¬ó one in the foreign worker dormitories and one among the local population, where numbers are more stable for now, he added.¬ìWe have had foreign worker cases before, including cases in dormitories. But this time, it is different, because there are many more venues outside of dorms, like Mustafa Centre and the Project Glory (construction site), where foreign workers had gathered and worked together, and the virus spread among them,¬î he said.¬ìAnd when they went back to the dorms, they transmitted it to fellow dorm residents. So it is very likely that the virus spread has been going around for some time in dorms and we are now seeing the indications of it.¬îThat is why Singapore needs a dedicated strategy for foreign workers, Mr Wong added.¬ìThere is a higher transmission rate among them, due to the high number of workers in close quarters.¬îThe strategy will firstly involve the effective management of all dormitories, which means taking care of foreign workers¬í basic needs and well-being, taking into account factors such as cleanliness and food, and ensuring that safe-distancing measures are fully complied with, Mr Wong said.Secondly, MOH has deployed medical posts, first at critical dormitories and then at other foreign worker lodgings, for active testing.To do all of this well, Singapore will need to reduce the number of workers in each dormitory, Mr Wong added.¬ìSo we are moving them out, those who are not sick, and accommodating them.¬îSingapore Armed Forces military camps, the Changi Exhibition Centre, floating hotels usually used for offshore accommodation and a few vacant Housing and Development Board blocks are among the properties that have been requisitioned for this purpose.¬ìEssentially we are sparing no effort,¬î Mr Wong said. ¬ìWe have a responsibility to these foreign workers who come all the way here at considerable expense.¬î¬ìDespite our best efforts, all of us will have to be mentally prepared for the number of cases in dorms to rise¬Ö But we do have comprehensive measures in place,¬î he added.Read more at https://www.todayonline.com/singapor...26012019_today","09-04-2020, 08:28 PM", SAF Camps among a few locations to relocate foreign workers working in essential services

"this link is correcthttps://www.zaobao.com.sg/realtime/s...m_medium=shareEnglish onehttps://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...ghest-12624378SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 287 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday (Apr 9), the largest daily increase so far and more than double yesterday's highest record, the multi-ministry task force dealing with the coronavirus said during a press conference on Thursday (Apr 9).This brings the national tally to 1,910.Of the new cases, 219 are linked to existing clusters, with at least 160 cases linked to the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol.A total of 19 cases are linked to previous cases, with 46 unlinked cases, the task force said. Three of the latest cases announced are imported. 314 cases have been discharged from acute care, and 705 cases have been moved to a community isolation facility, the task force said. Singapore has also seen six fatalities from COVID-19, the task force said. It was reported on Wednesday a 32-year-old Indian national died after taking a swab test, and was confirmed to have COVID-19 after his death.READ: Day 2 of COVID-19 'circuit breaker' sees more than 3,000 breaches of safe distancing measuresAdvertisementThe task force said that with the help of the police and Ministry of Defence, it established a link between the  cluster at Mustafa Centre shopping mall and the Project Glory construction site as well as a number of foreign worker dormitories: S11 Dormitory@Punggol, Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tampines Dormitory Cochrane Lodge II  and Toh Guan Dormitory. Director of medical services at the Ministry of Health Assoc Prof Kenneth Mak described how some of the dormitory cases were linked to the Mustafa Centre cluster.""We believe that the workers had visited Mustafa and they subsequently transmitted the infection to their co-workers,"" he said.  ""Transmission most likely occurred through close contact,for example at meal times, during breaks, and also between co-workers at work due to physical proximity at work sites,"" he said.Subsequently, they could have spread the infection to colleagues and friends within the dormitories, he added. Singapore has seen a rise of COVID-19 cases at foreign worker domitories recently.Sungei Tengah Lodge became the fourth foreign worker dormitory to become an isolation area from midnight on Thursday, in a move aimed at preventing the spread of the disease.The other three dormitores that have been gazetted as isolation areas are: S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, Westlite Toh Guan dormitory and Toh Guan Dormitory.READ: COVID-19: Sungei Tengah Lodge declared an isolation area under Infectious Diseases ActOn Thursday, the Land Transport Authority announced additional measures to ensure social distancing on public transport networks to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore.This includes thermal scanners at select MRT stations and safe distancing stickers on buses, trains, train stations, bus interchanges and bus stops.READ: COVID-19: Additional safe distancing measures implemented on public transportThis came after heightened safe distancing measures kicked in on Tuesday as part of a ""circuit breaker"" period until May 4 to stem the spread of COVID-19.About 10,000 written advisories were issued on the first two days of the circuit breaker for breaches, including individuals who gathered in public and those who failed to adhere to safe distancing rules.People who repeatedly flout the stricter safe-distancing measures will face a fine or be charged in court, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli wrote on Facebook on Thursday.First-time offenders will get a stern written warning. Anyone who commits a second offence will be fined S$300, while a third offence will lead to the person being charged in court.","09-04-2020, 07:53 PM", [BREAKING] COVID-19 [9 APRIL 2020] 287 NEW CASES

"Record 287 new Covid-19 cases in S'pore, links found between Mustafa Centre and clusters in foreign worker dormitoriesWorkers at the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol on April 6, 2020. Most of the new cases are linked to foreign worker dormitories.ST PHOTO: KEVIN LIMSINGAPORE - Singapore saw a sharp spike of 287 coronavirus cases on Thursday (April 9), with the majority linked to foreign worker dormitories.This is the highest daily number reported to date and brings the total number of cases here to 1,910, as the global number of cases crossed the 1.5 million mark.Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean is now advising the multi-ministry taskforce on handling the Covid-19 situation in foreign worker dormitories, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, noting that the police and Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) are involved in operations there.To cut the chain of transmission in dormitories, thousands of foreign workers who are healthy - especially those working in essential services - will be moved to army camps, floating hotels, and vacant Housing Board blocks.Singapore has also started active case finding and is swab-testing workers in various dormitories, said the Health Ministry's (MOH) director of medical services Kenneth Mak at a press conference on Thursday.Preliminary investigations have linked the cluster at Mustafa Centre with clusters at the construction site at Project Glory and five dormitories.Associate Professor Mak said the ministry believes that foreign workers had visited Mustafa Centre, where some employees had fallen ill, and gotten infected there.They then transmitted the infection to their co-workers, who subsequently infected others at their dormitories.""Many had very mild symptoms and so they continued to work, that's why there was a delay in picking them up,"" said Mr Wong, who chairs the ministerial task force along with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong. It is likely that the virus had been spreading in dormitories for some time, he said.Preliminary investigations have linked the cluster at Mustafa Centre with clusters at the construction site at Project Glory and five dormitories. ST PHOTOS: TIMOTHY DAVID, ONG WEE JINMr Wong said Singapore is dealing with two separate infection spreads.In foreign worker dormitories, numbers are rising sharply, he noted. But in the wider community, numbers are more stable.""This is a major and urgent issue that requires active intervention,"" he said. ""That is why we decided to put in more resources and set up a dedicated task force focusing on dorms.""On Tuesday, the Manpower Ministry (MOM) had announced the formation of an inter-agency task force to provide support to foreign workers and dormitory operators.The task force will ensure the well-being of workers and improve their living conditions by supporting dormitory operators as they implement ""circuit-breaker"" measures.MOM is supported by the Ministry of Health, National Environment Agency, the SAF, the Singapore Police Force, Migrant Workers' Centre and other agencies.Explaining the Government's decision to set up a task force, Mr Wong said: ""We cannot rely solely on dorm operators any more, given the current situation.""Manpower Minister Josephine Teo noted that there has been no cluster in dormitories until recently, even though a number of foreign workers have tested positive for the virus.""Bear in mind that dorms are home to foreign workers,"" she added. ""Within dorms workers interact with each other very regularly, very closely, they're like family, so the risk of transmission was always there.""Workers will now not be able to prepare their own meals, to reduce human contact, and cleanliness and hygiene have been stepped up. Existing sick bays will also be scaled up to take care of workers that need to be isolated.Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that despite*circuit breaker measures kicking in on Tuesday, social gatherings are still taking place. More than 10,000 written advisories have been issued over the past two days to those who did not observe safe distancing.""This cannot continue,"" he said.Mr Wong added that enforcement efforts will be stepped up against those who continue to flout safe-distancing measures.""We hope Singaporeans will comply not just because of enforcement efforts but really out of a necessity for all of us to do our part,"" he said.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...kEJMn-A5uAciPw","09-04-2020, 08:41 PM", [BREAKING] COVID-19 [9 APRIL 2020] 287 NEW CASES

Three of the latest cases announced are imported. 314 cases have been discharged from acute care, and 705 cases have been moved to a community isolation facility, the task force said. Singapore has also seen six fatalities from COVID-19, the task force said. It was reported on Wednesday a 32-year-old Indian national died after taking a swab test, and was confirmed to have COVID-19 after his death.READ: Day 2 of COVID-19 'circuit breaker' sees more than 3,000 breaches of safe distancing measuresAdvertisementThe task force said that with the help of the police and Ministry of Defence, it established a link between the  cluster at Mustafa Centre shopping mall and the Project Glory construction site as well as a number of foreign worker dormitories: S11 Dormitory@Punggol, Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tampines Dormitory Cochrane Lodge II  and Toh Guan Dormitory. Director of medical services at the Ministry of Health Assoc Prof Kenneth Mak described how some of the dormitory cases were linked to the Mustafa Centre cluster.""We believe that the workers had visited Mustafa and they subsequently transmitted the infection to their co-workers,"" he said.  ""Transmission most likely occurred through close contact,for example at meal times, during breaks, and also between co-workers at work due to physical proximity at work sites,"" he said.Subsequently, they could have spread the infection to colleagues and friends within the dormitories, he added. Singapore has seen a rise of COVID-19 cases at foreign worker domitories recently.Sungei Tengah Lodge became the fourth foreign worker dormitory to become an isolation area from midnight on Thursday, in a move aimed at preventing the spread of the disease.The other three dormitores that have been gazetted as isolation areas are: S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, Westlite Toh Guan dormitory and Toh Guan Dormitory.READ: COVID-19: Sungei Tengah Lodge declared an isolation area under Infectious Diseases ActOn Thursday, the Land Transport Authority announced additional measures to ensure social distancing on public transport networks to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore.This includes thermal scanners at select MRT stations and safe distancing stickers on buses, trains, train stations, bus interchanges and bus stops.READ: COVID-19: Additional safe distancing measures implemented on public transportThis came after heightened safe distancing measures kicked in on Tuesday as part of a ""circuit breaker"" period until May 4 to stem the spread of COVID-19.About 10,000 written advisories were issued on the first two days of the circuit breaker for breaches, including individuals who gathered in public and those who failed to adhere to safe distancing rules.People who repeatedly flout the stricter safe-distancing measures will face a fine or be charged in court, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli wrote on Facebook on Thursday.First-time offenders will get a stern written warning. Anyone who commits a second offence will be fined S$300, while a third offence will lead to the person being charged in court.wow really more 1% from S11 Dorm","09-04-2020, 08:45 PM", [BREAKING] COVID-19 [9 APRIL 2020] 287 NEW CASES

"Links between seven clustersSpeaking at a press conference on Apr. 9, MOH's Director of Medical Science, Kenneth Mak, revealed that contact tracing efforts have established links between these seven clusters:Mustafa CentreProject Glory Construction SiteS11 Dormitory @ PunggolTampines DormitoryToh Guan DormitorySungei Tengah LodgeCochrane Lodge IIAs of Apr. 8, the total number of cases in these clusters, excluding the ones from Mustafa, is 224.Started with Mustafa clusterMak explained that the cases began with the Mustafa cluster after a number of employees in the mall tested positive for Covid-19.""We believe that the (foreign) workers had visited Mustafa, and they subsequently transmitted the infection to their co-workers, either at the Project Glory construction site or to other residents within the dormitories that they lived in,"" said Mak.It is believed that the transmissions most likely occurred through close contact, such as during mealtimes or the physical proximity of workers at the construction site.They then subsequently transmitted the virus to friends and colleagues within their dormitories through social activities.Continued to work despite having mild symptomsNational Development Minister Lawrence Wong added that many of the workers had very mild symptoms and thus, they continued to work.He stated:""That's why there was a delay in picking them up. So it's very likely that the virus spread had been going around for some time in the dormitories, and we are now seeing all the indicators of it.""He said that Singapore is currently dealing with two separate infections ‚Äî within the foreign worker dormitories, where the numbers are rising sharply, and within the general population, where the numbers are more stable now.MOH working with MOM, SPF, MINDEF and SAFWith regard to the dormitory clusters, MOH has been working very closely with the joint task force that's led by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the Singapore Police Force (SPF), Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).MOH has set-up medical posts in the dormitories where medical personnel can look after workers as they present with symptoms.In addition, MOH is also performing an active case finding to look for workers who are not well and bring them down for further assessment if necessary.When symptomatic workers are identified, they would be immediately isolated and prevented from mixing with other workers in the dormitory.If they test positive for Covid-19, they will be treated at a hospital or community isolation facility.Those who are not tested positive but remain symptomatic they will be kept separated so as to prevent any infection from spreading to other workers in the dormitory.","09-04-2020, 08:56 PM", [BREAKING] COVID-19 [9 APRIL 2020] 287 NEW CASES

"Links between seven clustersSpeaking at a press conference on Apr. 9, MOH's Director of Medical Science, Kenneth Mak, revealed that contact tracing efforts have established links between these seven clusters:Mustafa CentreProject Glory Construction SiteS11 Dormitory @ PunggolTampines DormitoryToh Guan DormitorySungei Tengah LodgeCochrane Lodge IIAs of Apr. 8, the total number of cases in these clusters, excluding the ones from Mustafa, is 224.Started with Mustafa clusterMak explained that the cases began with the Mustafa cluster after a number of employees in the mall tested positive for Covid-19.""We believe that the (foreign) workers had visited Mustafa, and they subsequently transmitted the infection to their co-workers, either at the Project Glory construction site or to other residents within the dormitories that they lived in,"" said Mak.It is believed that the transmissions most likely occurred through close contact, such as during mealtimes or the physical proximity of workers at the construction site.They then subsequently transmitted the virus to friends and colleagues within their dormitories through social activities.Continued to work despite having mild symptomsNational Development Minister Lawrence Wong added that many of the workers had very mild symptoms and thus, they continued to work.He stated:""That's why there was a delay in picking them up. So it's very likely that the virus spread had been going around for some time in the dormitories, and we are now seeing all the indicators of it.""He said that Singapore is currently dealing with two separate infections ¬ó within the foreign worker dormitories, where the numbers are rising sharply, and within the general population, where the numbers are more stable now.MOH working with MOM, SPF, MINDEF and SAFWith regard to the dormitory clusters, MOH has been working very closely with the joint task force that's led by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the Singapore Police Force (SPF), Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).MOH has set-up medical posts in the dormitories where medical personnel can look after workers as they present with symptoms.In addition, MOH is also performing an active case finding to look for workers who are not well and bring them down for further assessment if necessary.When symptomatic workers are identified, they would be immediately isolated and prevented from mixing with other workers in the dormitory.If they test positive for Covid-19, they will be treated at a hospital or community isolation facility.Those who are not tested positive but remain symptomatic they will be kept separated so as to prevent any infection from spreading to other workers in the dormitory.SAF barracks open to them liao https://www.facebook.com/mindefsg/vi...7886520605473/","09-04-2020, 09:01 PM", [BREAKING] COVID-19 [9 APRIL 2020] 287 NEW CASES

"https://www.linkedin.com/content-gue...igmcLuuodWKDsMQuote:This post is for those of you who somehow still don't understand how it is that China achieved getting the virus outbreak under control. There are no lies about it. There are no new cases and when a few crop up, the controls here are quickly put back in place. Our children are STILL not back to school even though there are no new cases. And this is even if President Trump wonders whether ""those numbers seem light"". I don't whether to laugh, cry or throw dishes at the wall.Here is exactly what we did and how we did it. (Living here for 21 years and having been here through the entire winter months up to now, I am extremely familiar with what has happened here on the ground along with thousands of other foreigners here as well, including our community through many of the chambers of commerce.) If you were also here in China during this time, then you fully understand this situation as well, please feel free to add anything I may have missed in the comments.1. The reason China does NOT have any new cases and got the virus completely under control in a few weeks is because even BEFORE any province had less than a hundred cases, the ENTIRE country was COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN. And EVERY person at all times outside wears a MASK. It is mandatory, not optional. What don't you understand about this crystal clear explanation?2. For example, here where we live in Liaoning province, we only had 89 cases and the ENTIRE province was shut down.3. ALL public transportation, EVERY retail shop, EVERY office building, EVERY school. EVERYTHING was ENTIRELY shutdown.4. The ONLY thing you could do was go to a nearby grocery store with temperature and QR scan controls to buy groceries. That's it. Every 3-4 days I went out to one of the two large markets that were open. On entering, they took your temperature and you scan the QR code to track where and when you were so they can back trace who you were in contact with later if you later developed symptoms.5. After shopping, then go back home and enjoy your self isolated. With your children at home because the schools were shut. It has been a struggle to keep Vincent busy in a routine, moving him from playtime to online courses to reading to playing downstairs. But we're doing great.6. THIS is what WE did for weeks. More importantly, THIS is what EVERY province across the ENTIRE country WITHOUT exception DID. This was provinces with very few cases.7. We didn't WAIT. The govt said do it, we did it. Its called civic duty and sacrifice to your community in the society in which you live.8. By end of February, most provinces had no new cases. All controls remain in place, now relaxed. If and when any small clusters of new cases pop up, those controls will instantly be turned ON again. So there will never be another large outbreak ever again anywhere in China.9. Updated here: As of now, all cities have rolled out the ""Green Health QR Code APP across China's cities. Every Chinese citizen has it on their mobile devices. Here in Shenyang, for example, you need to QR scan show your green health code when you enter the subway, or a mall. Simple. If for some reason, it is yellow you can 't go and if it is red, you belong at home in quarantine. The software works for foreigners in most cities. Here in Shenyang, it is not updated yet. So foreigners need to show their passport and register in a manual book in that case. (UPDATE the version that works for foreigners in Shenyang is now available) Perfect? Nope, definitely not. Annoying at times? Sure. But its a system in action being rolled out and tweaked at lightning speed across the country. Privacy? Hah, don't make me laugh. You better get over that one anywhere on planet earth.So now I want to ask you. DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE SILLY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY THERE ARE NO CASES HERE IN CHINA?Or do you still believe the latest CIA ""Intelligence"" report and other media on how things are still bad in China, which by the way are just trying to make you feel better about how bad things are there instead?And another point regarding all the cremation urns in Wuhan. This is because ALL people who had died from January 1st onward were never released during the outbreak lockdown period because, as I told you all businesses were shut down, which would include ceremony/cemetery services for urns. So it was a backlog of the normal # of people who die which is also thousands plus the virus patients who died.And on the millions of cell phones cancelled, that's because all the workers on very low salaries/income at home for 3 months cancelled their mobile subs to save money while they knew they were stuck at home for at least two months.Are you done speculating? I surely hope so.Thanks, God Bless, Go Home and Stay Home until the end of May and don't touch ANYTHING outside your home, Use sanitizer and wipes. Don't get near ANY PERSON whose history you don't know. Tough. Simple. Do It. I told you before, act like you're going camping for a few weeks. Enjoy yourself and practice hygiene and isolation vigilantly.","10-04-2020, 01:45 AM", [BREAKING] COVID-19 [9 APRIL 2020] 287 NEW CASES

"Way back in January, opposition strategy leader Alex Tan zhixiang correctly predicted that foreign workers will be the weakest link in Singapore.  Alex also correctly pointed out the fake news by the government like People's Association claiming the virus will not spread in crowded places, the shortage of N95 face masks, the imminent border closure and the eventual shortage of essential goods in Singapore.Alex was also the first one who wrote that not wearing a face mask in public is going to be catastrophic, and even called Lee Hsien Loong a fool, and his WHO adviser Dale Fisher a Trojan Horse for issuing the advice.Alex also repeatedly warned that local transmission is out of control, and nobody listened. Is Alex claiming credits? Well, Alex is just giving credits where it is due. Alex did hit all the right buttons after all.For today's chaos, Alex still has solutions. Again, Alex will reveal them only when it is too late.Why? Because  Alex is not a MP or a Minister. ""Nobody owes you a living"", hear that all the time don't you, Alex don't owe anyone his ideas and solutions either.Singaporean fools voted for the PAP, so they must pay for this.Come this General Election, try repeating the same mistake, if you are still alive.My monkey has psychic ability, if you mess with him, he will fark you.

"There are more than 40,000 Malaysians still in Singapore and the Malaysian state of Johor hopes that Singapore will make exemptions for them to be tested for Covid-19 before they are allowed to return to the state.More Malaysian workers are making their way back from Singapore after the Republic began implementing stricter measures to address the pandemic under a period known as the ""circuit breaker"". The measures which began on April 7 and will go on until May 4 have seen most workplaces and schools closed in order to reduce the risk of infections.Currently, Malaysians who test negative in Singapore will be able to go home and be quarantined there, while those without any certification or prior testing will be required to undergo compulsory 14-day quarantine at one of the government centres statewide.Johor Mentri Besar Hasni Mohammad said the state was working with the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the matter with their counterpart in Singapore given that the city-state presently does not conduct Covid-19 tests unless a person has showed symptoms.Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia Vanu Gopala Menon previously said there was currently no requirement by the Singapore government to provide random Covid-19 tests for foreign workers while Singapore's Ministry of Health has said that Covid-19 testing is only performed when clinically indicated, for patients and their close contacts.""That means a Malaysian can't get the test done in Singapore unless they are symptomatic, "" Datuk Hasni said in an interview in the Johor district of Iskandar Puteri.""We hope Singapore will allow for some exemptions so that Malaysians who want to return can get this test done at its clinics or hospitals, "" he said.Hasni said he was confident that the matter would be discussed through the Malaysia-Singapore Special Working Committee on Covid-19 for a solution to be reached.He said since Malaysia implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) on March 18 to curb the coronavirus, it has resolved certain issues, including easing the movement of cargo, essential and non-essential items between both countries as well as accommodation for Malaysian workers in Singapore.""The government will not stop Malaysians returning from Singapore and I can assure them that our frontliners have taken all the necessary steps and procedures at our border, "" he said.Hasni urged returning Malaysians to give their full cooperation to the frontliners conducting the necessary screening and testing at the checkpoints.On the number of Malaysians returning from Singapore after the island republic started its own measures to curb the spread of the virus, Hasni said the biggest influx was registered on April 3 with some 3,400 people. ""Since then there have been between 500 and 600 Malaysians coming back per day and we have been able to cope with the numbers, "" he added.https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se...re-they-return","13-04-2020, 09:44 AM", Johor still hopes Singapore will test Malaysian workers for Covid-19 before they return

"There are more than 40,000 Malaysians still in Singapore and the Malaysian state of Johor hopes that Singapore will make exemptions for them to be tested for Covid-19 before they are allowed to return to the state.More Malaysian workers are making their way back from Singapore after the Republic began implementing stricter measures to address the pandemic under a period known as the ""circuit breaker"". The measures which began on April 7 and will go on until May 4 have seen most workplaces and schools closed in order to reduce the risk of infections.Currently, Malaysians who test negative in Singapore will be able to go home and be quarantined there, while those without any certification or prior testing will be required to undergo compulsory 14-day quarantine at one of the government centres statewide.Johor Mentri Besar Hasni Mohammad said the state was working with the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the matter with their counterpart in Singapore given that the city-state presently does not conduct Covid-19 tests unless a person has showed symptoms.Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia Vanu Gopala Menon previously said there was currently no requirement by the Singapore government to provide random Covid-19 tests for foreign workers while Singapore's Ministry of Health has said that Covid-19 testing is only performed when clinically indicated, for patients and their close contacts.""That means a Malaysian can't get the test done in Singapore unless they are symptomatic, "" Datuk Hasni said in an interview in the Johor district of Iskandar Puteri.""We hope Singapore will allow for some exemptions so that Malaysians who want to return can get this test done at its clinics or hospitals, "" he said.Hasni said he was confident that the matter would be discussed through the Malaysia-Singapore Special Working Committee on Covid-19 for a solution to be reached.He said since Malaysia implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) on March 18 to curb the coronavirus, it has resolved certain issues, including easing the movement of cargo, essential and non-essential items between both countries as well as accommodation for Malaysian workers in Singapore.""The government will not stop Malaysians returning from Singapore and I can assure them that our frontliners have taken all the necessary steps and procedures at our border, "" he said.Hasni urged returning Malaysians to give their full cooperation to the frontliners conducting the necessary screening and testing at the checkpoints.On the number of Malaysians returning from Singapore after the island republic started its own measures to curb the spread of the virus, Hasni said the biggest influx was registered on April 3 with some 3,400 people. ""Since then there have been between 500 and 600 Malaysians coming back per day and we have been able to cope with the numbers, "" he added.https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se...re-they-returnjust tell them all healthy and get them home to malaysia.","13-04-2020, 09:56 AM", Johor still hopes Singapore will test Malaysian workers for Covid-19 before they return

"There are more than 40,000 Malaysians still in Singapore and the Malaysian state of Johor hopes that Singapore will make exemptions for them to be tested for Covid-19 before they are allowed to return to the state.More Malaysian workers are making their way back from Singapore after the Republic began implementing stricter measures to address the pandemic under a period known as the ""circuit breaker"". The measures which began on April 7 and will go on until May 4 have seen most workplaces and schools closed in order to reduce the risk of infections.Currently, Malaysians who test negative in Singapore will be able to go home and be quarantined there, while those without any certification or prior testing will be required to undergo compulsory 14-day quarantine at one of the government centres statewide.Johor Mentri Besar Hasni Mohammad said the state was working with the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the matter with their counterpart in Singapore given that the city-state presently does not conduct Covid-19 tests unless a person has showed symptoms.Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia Vanu Gopala Menon previously said there was currently no requirement by the Singapore government to provide random Covid-19 tests for foreign workers while Singapore's Ministry of Health has said that Covid-19 testing is only performed when clinically indicated, for patients and their close contacts.""That means a Malaysian can't get the test done in Singapore unless they are symptomatic, "" Datuk Hasni said in an interview in the Johor district of Iskandar Puteri.""We hope Singapore will allow for some exemptions so that Malaysians who want to return can get this test done at its clinics or hospitals, "" he said.Hasni said he was confident that the matter would be discussed through the Malaysia-Singapore Special Working Committee on Covid-19 for a solution to be reached.He said since Malaysia implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) on March 18 to curb the coronavirus, it has resolved certain issues, including easing the movement of cargo, essential and non-essential items between both countries as well as accommodation for Malaysian workers in Singapore.""The government will not stop Malaysians returning from Singapore and I can assure them that our frontliners have taken all the necessary steps and procedures at our border, "" he said.Hasni urged returning Malaysians to give their full cooperation to the frontliners conducting the necessary screening and testing at the checkpoints.On the number of Malaysians returning from Singapore after the island republic started its own measures to curb the spread of the virus, Hasni said the biggest influx was registered on April 3 with some 3,400 people. ""Since then there have been between 500 and 600 Malaysians coming back per day and we have been able to cope with the numbers, "" he added.https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se...re-they-returnQuite a number of them run back to Malaysia by producing just MC from Singapore doctors.M‚Äôsian In S‚Äôpore Shares How To Go Home For Those Affected By Our Neighbour‚Äôs Lockdownhttps://mustsharenews.com/malaysian-journey-home/4th Apr 20","13-04-2020, 11:23 AM", Johor still hopes Singapore will test Malaysian workers for Covid-19 before they return

"There are more than 40,000 Malaysians still in Singapore and the Malaysian state of Johor hopes that Singapore will make exemptions for them to be tested for Covid-19 before they are allowed to return to the state.More Malaysian workers are making their way back from Singapore after the Republic began implementing stricter measures to address the pandemic under a period known as the ""circuit breaker"". The measures which began on April 7 and will go on until May 4 have seen most workplaces and schools closed in order to reduce the risk of infections.Currently, Malaysians who test negative in Singapore will be able to go home and be quarantined there, while those without any certification or prior testing will be required to undergo compulsory 14-day quarantine at one of the government centres statewide.Johor Mentri Besar Hasni Mohammad said the state was working with the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the matter with their counterpart in Singapore given that the city-state presently does not conduct Covid-19 tests unless a person has showed symptoms.Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia Vanu Gopala Menon previously said there was currently no requirement by the Singapore government to provide random Covid-19 tests for foreign workers while Singapore's Ministry of Health has said that Covid-19 testing is only performed when clinically indicated, for patients and their close contacts.""That means a Malaysian can't get the test done in Singapore unless they are symptomatic, "" Datuk Hasni said in an interview in the Johor district of Iskandar Puteri.""We hope Singapore will allow for some exemptions so that Malaysians who want to return can get this test done at its clinics or hospitals, "" he said.Hasni said he was confident that the matter would be discussed through the Malaysia-Singapore Special Working Committee on Covid-19 for a solution to be reached.He said since Malaysia implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) on March 18 to curb the coronavirus, it has resolved certain issues, including easing the movement of cargo, essential and non-essential items between both countries as well as accommodation for Malaysian workers in Singapore.""The government will not stop Malaysians returning from Singapore and I can assure them that our frontliners have taken all the necessary steps and procedures at our border, "" he said.Hasni urged returning Malaysians to give their full cooperation to the frontliners conducting the necessary screening and testing at the checkpoints.On the number of Malaysians returning from Singapore after the island republic started its own measures to curb the spread of the virus, Hasni said the biggest influx was registered on April 3 with some 3,400 people. ""Since then there have been between 500 and 600 Malaysians coming back per day and we have been able to cope with the numbers, "" he added.https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se...re-they-return","13-04-2020, 02:56 PM", Johor still hopes Singapore will test Malaysian workers for Covid-19 before they return

"Demand for isolation facilities would likely increase and we should not assume all foreign workers (FWs) are sick.  Healthy FWs could be deployed to increase our isolation capacities. As such, I suggest we:1. Identify areas to build / house these foreign workers e.g. Expo, defuncted army camps.2. Swab FWs in the construction / electrical industries.  Those are tested negative would be housed at the available facilities e.g. Expo and defuncted / operational camps.  3. Deployed these healthy FWs to build the more temporary isolation facilities. 4. In the longer term, all FWs would vacate the dormitories to facilitate upgrade / deep cleaning. The potential upsides:1. Preserve mental wellbeing and improve living environment of FWs.2. Ease the pressure on healthcare system. 3. Provide business for economy.4. Reduce potential of riot.  Police could be deployed for other purposes e.g. contact tracing.  The potential downsides:1. Potential new clusters as Sars-Cov-19 might not be detected with what we have.  To mitigate the risk of transmission, FWs are to be isolated after work.  Basic necessities e.g. internet and food are to be provided. Workplace are to be disinfected before the next shift of FWs takes over.","07-04-2020, 01:13 AM", How would you solve the foreign worker dorm isolation situation?

"Quote:Siloso Beach Resort on Sentosa will be used to house foreign workers, the the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) said in response to media queries on April 30.Workers will have to undergo medical testing to ensure they do not have any symptoms of Covid-19 infection before they can move into the resort that has been designated by the government as one of the facilities to house healthy migrant workers.The SLA spokesperson said on-site amenities and meals will be provided for the well-being of the occupants.This latest move is to get healthy migrant workers out of dormitories.Siloso Beach Resort has 196 rooms.However, it is not known exactly how many foreign workers will be housed there.So far, about 10,000 workers who are not sick have been moved out of the dormitories.These include those working in essential services.They are currently staying at Singapore Armed Forces camp sites, floating hotels, vacant public housing blocks, Singapore Police Force and the Singapore Civil Defence Force facilities, and converted sports halls.","30-04-2020, 11:50 PM", Covid-19: Healthy foreign workers to be moved to Siloso Beach Resort in Sentosa

In 3rd-world countries, their people are scared to be tested for mild symptoms because they don't want to end up quarantined in a crowded shared community facility. By now, can see some Singaporeans are also scared to be tested also after news of those facilities were set up after NTUC resort. (Singapore expo, Changi Exhibition hall, Tanjong Pajar terminal, a haunted ulu army camp..) Especially, those Singaporeans working in frontline or essential services, they sick also go to work because they scared if they test positive, their whole family have to be tested along with them, end up send their family to those quarantine facilities if the NTUC resort is full. If the gov wants the CB to be fruitful, must give them an assurance to encourage people not to hide their symptoms and get tested. If not, the undetected pool in the community will grow because people scared to be tested. Then, we have CB for what? As long as undetected cases exist if CB is lifted, we end up back to square one. That's why it's just as important to eliminate that hidden pool of virus within our community too... not just the FW dormitory side. We want fake local numbers (due to undetected cases) just to have that false sense of assurance, or we want honest numbers now first (search all those undetected cases), for better result after CB is lifted?

,"12-04-2020, 10:03 PM", Life In Isolation: Inside Singapore's Foreign Worker Dormitories During COVID-19
" Foreign workers who are unwell are being identified and separated from other workers, said the multi-agency task force tackling the Covid-19 outbreak, adding that even those who do not show symptoms but are close contacts of confirmed cases are being tested.As of Tuesday (April 14), it said about 7,000 workers who are well and working in essential services have been moved outside of dormitories to other accommodations such as army camps.The task force gave an outline of the measures that have been taken in recent days to tackle the spike in the number of Covid-19 cases involving foreign worker dormitories.It said more than 1,500 workers who have been transferred out of dormitories deemed as isolation areas have been tested over the weekend, and about 5,000 workers are expected to be tested in the next few days.The Ministry of Health's director of medical services, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, said in a virtual press conference: ""Our commitment to the foreign workers is that if they are infected, we want to find them, and we want to be very clear that we're not intending to leave them alone, unattended.""So if we have any concerns, particularly in any of the dormitories where there is, in fact, an infected foreign worker, then we want to know where they are and we will make plans to test as many of them as is possible.""Work is ongoing to test asymptomatic workers or those with minimal symptoms, Prof Mak said.""In some dormitories, we have started work to screen close contacts of confirmed cases. For example, they may be fellow workers who share the same room and, because of their proximity of contact in their living arrangements, are deemed therefore as at higher risk.""We also have tested various other foreign workers in different settings. For example, for some of the workers that have in fact been transferred out from the dormitories that are deemed as isolation areas, we've also tested as a precaution to make sure that as we transfer workers from one place to another, we're not also then seeding new areas, and therefore contributing causing more clusters.""Replying to a question on the number of patients housed at the Singapore Expo, Prof Mak said there were 297 patients there as of yesterday. Another 150 to 160 patients will be transferred there today.""It's steadily building... in fact, would span across several halls. At this point in time, we are planning to use Halls 1 to 6, but we have opened Hall 3 first,"" he said.""And as Hall 3 progressively gets filled up to its full capacity of 480 cases... then we would progressively open the other halls as well until we reach our full capacity.""https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...box=1586864291","14-04-2020, 08:25 PM"," About 5,000 foreign workers to be tested for Covid-19 in next few days"
"Singapore's COVID-19 cases exceed 3,000 with 334 new infections; situation remains 'critical'SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 334 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday (Apr 14), bringing the national total to 3,252. None of the new cases are imported. Of the new cases, 189 are linked to previously identified clusters and 23 are linked to other local cases. A total of 122 are still unlinked, pending contact tracing. Of these, 24 are Singapore citizens and the remaining 98 are long-term pass holders. Nine patients have died from complications due to COVID-19.At a press conference held on Tuesday, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that by and large, Singaporeans are taking circuit breaker measures seriously, but the country cannot be complacent.AdvertisementMr Gan, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force set up to handle the COVID-19 situation, said: ""We remain in a critical situation, the number of cases has been increasing.""He noted that Monday's tally, 386, was the highest daily total so far.The number of cases among foreign workers, especially those in dormitories, rose sharply to around 200 cases per day, reaching about 300 cases on Monday, he added.INTERACTIVE: All the COVID-19 clusters at dorms and construction sites""This increase is likely to continue as we undertake more testing in the dormitories. The outbreak in the foreign worker dormitories has become an important front in our fight against COVID-19,"" he said.A large number of Singapore's recent COVID-19 cases have been linked to foreign worker dormitories.Eight dormitories have been declared isolation areas, meaning residents have to be quarantined in their rooms.Singapore has put in place strict safe distancing measures during what it calls a circuit breaker period to stem the spread of COVID-19. The measures - which include closing non-essential workplaces and schools - will be in place for one month until May 4.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...ation-12639766","14-04-2020, 07:17 PM", [14 APRIL 2020] COVID-19 NEW CASES: 334

"Singapore's COVID-19 cases exceed 3,000 with 334 new infections; situation remains 'critical'SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 334 new cases of COVID-19 on Tuesday (Apr 14), bringing the national total to 3,252. None of the new cases are imported. Of the new cases, 189 are linked to previously identified clusters and 23 are linked to other local cases. A total of 122 are still unlinked, pending contact tracing. Of these, 24 are Singapore citizens and the remaining 98 are long-term pass holders. Nine patients have died from complications due to COVID-19.At a press conference held on Tuesday, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that by and large, Singaporeans are taking circuit breaker measures seriously, but the country cannot be complacent.AdvertisementMr Gan, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force set up to handle the COVID-19 situation, said: ""We remain in a critical situation, the number of cases has been increasing.""He noted that Monday's tally, 386, was the highest daily total so far.The number of cases among foreign workers, especially those in dormitories, rose sharply to around 200 cases per day, reaching about 300 cases on Monday, he added.INTERACTIVE: All the COVID-19 clusters at dorms and construction sites""This increase is likely to continue as we undertake more testing in the dormitories. The outbreak in the foreign worker dormitories has become an important front in our fight against COVID-19,"" he said.A large number of Singapore's recent COVID-19 cases have been linked to foreign worker dormitories.Eight dormitories have been declared isolation areas, meaning residents have to be quarantined in their rooms.Singapore has put in place strict safe distancing measures during what it calls a circuit breaker period to stem the spread of COVID-19. The measures - which include closing non-essential workplaces and schools - will be in place for one month until May 4.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...ation-12639766","14-04-2020, 07:31 PM", [14 APRIL 2020] COVID-19 NEW CASES: 334

"this is very important to preserve equipment for healthcare workers.in the early stages of a pandemica lot of people dont understand.Oh, I think many of us do understand that, I sure as hell do, but why discourage people from wearing masks then? Do you know I get weird looks, and people not wanting to share the lift with me when I have my mask on back when the BS campaign was in full swing? That erroneous 'Healthy don't need masks' campaign may have discourage some from wearing masks.

The moment I clicked post, it disappeared and I don't see it on his wall except for only his messages.*Hong Kong, with much domestic unrest and violence, managed to do a better job than your government in dealing with the COVID19 pandemic crisis. Meaning they were in the midst of a crisis management, when this COVID19 pandemic crisis happened, and they managed it so well too. In fact quite a number of countries, Taiwan, New Zealand, South Korea, etc, with higher population than us with Ministers earning much less than you and your Ministers, have carried out a better crisis management, with foresight. You and your Ministers are earning an exorbitant amount of salary and failing miserably during this COVID19 pandemic crisis. Your worth should be evident, not during the good times but times like this adverse condition. It's fine if you and your government had erred but at least be accountable and apologetic, instead of going on your defence to give excuses. This is not the first time. Each and every time you have messed it up, it's always going on the defence with excuses. Never apologetic with reasons. It's fine to be wrong. No one is perfect. For at least once be bold enough to be accountable, apologetic and be outright about your next course of action. It's so easy for you and your government to point fingers at the opposition but get offended when fingers are pointed at you and be revengeful. To mention that I'm disappointed and frustrated is understating. Do the right thing by going live on television again to admit that you and your government had erred and apologise.

"So, I guess you approve of the govt passing the buck to the WHO, right? Any fool could see that that Tedros character was bending his backside to XJP and the CCP, so this shady character was obviously not to be trusted. Also, any govt that runs a country has to have people who have to think for themselves, and NOT follow everything a foreign body says, even IF, and now, especially IF it's from the WHO. We need people who can think out of the box,and are able see the situation from the ground, sure they need to get reports from local sources, but they should watch foreign news to get a clearer view of what was happening in Wuhan at the height of the outbreak. Many of us here were clamoring for a lockdown, especially flights from China at the time, but this Tedros character was reticent about declaring the situation in Wuhan as a PHEIC, allowing them to escape to the various countries. A govt should NOT be sheep that's herded by a bad shepherd (WHO) when it's gambling with its citizens' lives. Think about it, had the 4G leadership had the stones to say, ""Screw what the WHO is saying, we will lockdown the airport and ban Chinese citizens from entering Sg at the outbreak of COVID-19, we would be in much better shape right now.

"I don't doubt there are many who want extended lockdown purely so they can nua more and WFH, instead of things going back to normal and having to go into office.But there are probably just as many, possibly much much more people who want an extended lockdown to ensure that the virus is contained and things can go back to some kind of normal.FWs are still part of the resident population here. Still need extended lockdown. If its lifted too early, then FWs go back to their workplace, go back to Mustafa, go back on MRT/bus, then wait again another round of infections, causing an even bigger local transmission.I can see your logic, but what's your definition of ""contained""? I was thinking along the lines of the gov letting the majority of the population resume work after 4 May, with the exception of those businesses that require Bangla workers. Masks and social distancing etc will still be maintained and enforced with fines whenever caught.The problem with lockdowns is that govs all over the world (except probably China) have no exit strategy.

"I can see your logic, but what's your definition of ""contained""? I was thinking along the lines of the gov letting the majority of the population resume work after 4 May, with the exception of those businesses that require Bangla workers. Masks and social distancing etc will still be maintained and enforced with fines whenever caught.The problem with lockdowns is that govs all over the world (except probably China) have no exit strategy. Malaysia is a good example.....Well, personally for me, I would want zero cases for 2 weeks before lifting the lockdown.But I am not an epidemiologist. So I will defer condition parameter settings for lifting a lockdown to trained professional epidemiologists with no political bias/obligations. Disease outbreaks are not new in human history. Surely WHO or CDC or whatever have protocols on when a disease outbreak can be deemed as contained/eradicated/resolved etc.No such thing as no exit strategy since the final aim for any country is simply to have no more cases. Its just that this kind of things, politicians will not want to discuss openly with the public. Don't dare to jinx, don't want to over commit. Ditto for doctors/epidemiologists.No. No such thing as half lifting, letting majority of people go back to work after May 4th. Do things cannot half-fark, like this half-fark SG lockdown. Only today then say wear masks ish now mandatory. If PAP never say must wear masks, still will have some cockanadons refuse to wear, just cause they don't want to.Even today, mandatory mask wearing, they still allow for exceptions eg no need to wear masks for duration of exercise. After exercise, must mask on. Simi sai. Just ban exercise. People really want to keep fit, jolly well do static station training at home. Cannot run outside, just do high intensity cardio workout at home cannot meh?So just to go back to the original point of when to lift a lockdown, its not hard at all to update pre-existing exit protocols for disease outbreaks for this Wuhan Coronavirus. Other than that, all efforts should be focused on ensuring this virus is eradicated. Of course, if exit conditions are never met for a long time, then have to see how then. But no country barring China is yet at that stage.Even now, China also never say everything ok liao after lifting their lockdown(s). Their obvious fear is that there could be imported cases if China just fully opens its doors and resumes normal operations. Then China will headache again.For SG, being so densely populated, easy for infections to sexplode, but also easier to contain, cos small area mah. Because of that, SG should be able to lift lockdown earlier than other countries even though SG entered lockdown phase much later. But also, since small area means its probably easier for re-infections to occur, PAP cannot afford to ramp down the seriousness in its messaging about Wuhan Coronavirus. Otherwise, people will become complacent again, setting the conditions for possible re-infection wave.","14-04-2020, 11:27 PM", [14 APRIL 2020] COVID-19 NEW CASES: 334

"MASKS NOW COMPULSORY FOR ALL SINGAPOREANS WHEN THEY HEAD OUT  https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news...-wong-12640828SINGAPORE: It is now mandatory to wear a mask when stepping out of the house, with some exceptions, announced Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong on Tuesday (Apr 14). The mask-wearing requirement takes effect immediately, said Mr Wong, as he spoke at a press conference conducted by the multi-ministry task force tackling COVID-19. Individuals who are caught refusing to wear a mask will be fined S$300 on their first offence, while those who flout the rule a second time will be fined S$1,000. Egregious cases will be prosecuted in court, he added. Foreign residents caught breaching these rules might have their work passes or permanent resident status revoked.Mr Wong, who co-chairs the the task force with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, noted that the Government had updated its advisory on masks based on the ""latest medical and scientific advice¬î and that the exercise to distribute reusable masks to Singaporeans was completed over the weekend. ¬ìNow that we have distributed the mask to everyone and generally people have started to adjust to the new requirements or the advisory, we are making it mandatory for all,¬î said Mr Wong.;¬ìThe minute you leave your room, or you leave your house, you have to wear a mask when you go out.¬îREAD: Singapore's COVID-19 cases exceed 3,000 with 334 new infections; situation remains 'critical'Children below the age of two will not need to wear a mask based on medical experts¬í recommendations on child safety, he said. As for adults, only those who are engaging in strenuous exercises like running and jogging do not have to wear a mask, but they will have to put it on once they stop exercising. Mr Wong also reiterated the need for them to maintain a safe distance from others when they are exercising. ¬ìWe are very happy that many Singaporeans and residents are cooperating and doing their part, and complying with these measures,¬î said Mr Wong, noting that movement across the island has reduced significantly. With safe distancing ambassadors and enforcement officers ¬ìhard at work on the ground¬î, hotspots like wet markets, hawker centres and parks ¬ìare generally now under control¬î, he said.¬ìMost people are doing the right thing. There are a few who are not and they will be dealt with.¬îAcknowledging that some people are finding it ¬ìhard to adjust¬î to the circuit breaker measures and are ¬ìsuffering from cabin fever¬î, Mr Wong said the Government has had to reject many appeals for activities. ¬ìWe cannot let up at this stage. These are still early days and we have at least another three more weeks to go. So we have to double down on our efforts and just stay at home.¬î About 20 per cent of the workforce comprises essential workers and continue to travel to their workplaces, Mr Wong noted. But the list of companies classified as essential services will be tightened further to reduce the number of people commuting to work.Those no mask how?

Do you know I get weird looks, and people not wanting to share the lift with me when I have my mask on back when the BS campaign was in full swing? That erroneous 'Healthy don't need masks' campaign may have discourage some from wearing masks. Also, had they simply admitted to the shortage (and that the reserve of masks is marked for health service providers) and encouraged us to fashion or source for our own masks, like the cloth masks now used by many, how many infections could have been prevented? We are seeing spikes in infection rate in the hundreds now as a direct result of that utterly ill thought out campaign which was a knee jerk reaction to the mask situation. Honestly, this multi-million dollar 4G ministers have failed to impress.....impressively!Yes, they cld jus say we do not hv enough mask and those who hv, please wear. It is oso asymptomatic.With the msg, it definitely will prevent those asymptomatic positive ones from spreading to others as they will be wearing mask till they fall real sick.Plus the 5 days MC oso just delaying those positive ones to quickly get their treatment before it started to attack more.Cant believe if ppl will continue to place their trust in this group after this is over.","15-04-2020, 09:18 AM", [14 APRIL 2020] COVID-19 NEW CASES: 334

"SINGAPORE ‚Äî Foreign workers have been in the authorities‚Äô sight early on in the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore at the start of the year, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on Monday (4 May).Delivering a ministerial statement in Parliament, she explained how the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) helped to prevent imported cases by limiting the return of work pass holders and monitoring returnees‚Äô compliance with Leaves of Absence and Stay-Home Notices, among other things.‚ÄúThroughout this period, migrant workers were also on our radar,‚Äù said Teo.‚ÄúBack in January, soon after the multi-ministry task force was set up, MOM reached out to dormitory operators to be more vigilant and to step up hygiene. In fact, one of the earliest media conferences that Minister Lawrence Wong and I held was at the Tuas View Dormitory, after we inspected their quarantine facilities in early February,‚Äù she said.Wong helms the National Development Ministry and co-chairs the Multi-Ministry Taskforce tackling the spread of the virus.Teo added, ‚ÄúWe produced materials in the workers‚Äô native languages to encourage them to take steps to protect themselves. Subsequently, non-essential facilities in the dormitories like gyms and TV rooms were closed. Meal-times and recreational hours were staggered. Intermixing between blocks was stopped.‚ÄúMOM officers also fanned out on weekends, to advise migrant workers to observe safe distancing measures and disperse big groups that were gathering at popular hangouts.‚Äù‚ÄòNarrow focus on rooming arrangements may not prevent recurrence‚ÄôIn February, the authorities detected the first COVID-19 cluster involving migrant workers at a construction site at Seletar Aerospace Heights. The five workers stayed at five different locations, only two of which were dormitories, Teo noted.‚ÄúThereafter, there was no indication of higher prevalence of COVID-19 among migrant workers, compared to the general community,‚Äù she said.Several MPs had raised queries on the outbreak of COVID-19 in dormitories. Jurong GRC MP Ang Wei Neng asked, among other things, about the lessons to be drawn from the management of dormitories and if safe distancing can be ‚Äúpractically practised‚Äù in the existing purpose-built dormitories.Meanwhile, Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng asked if MOM would consider raising the minimum gross floor area of 4.5 square metres for each resident in a foreign workers' dormitory; and not including the basic living facilities - such as living quarters, kitchen, dining, and toilet areas - in the computation for the minimum gross floor area.Nominated MPs Walter Theseira and Anthea Ong also asked if a Committee of Inquiry would be appointed to probe the COVID-19 outbreak in the dormitories.Responding, Teo said epidemiological findings show that within the dormitories which have clusters, not all blocks or rooms are equally affected. And across the different dormitories, infected workers were linked via common work sites.‚ÄúAt the work sites, it was not uncommon for the infected workers to take breaks together, share food and utensils. Likewise, infected workers from different dormitories had gathered during their rest days to socialise and shop, for example at Mustafa. Back in the dormitories, workers spent time with their friends, cooking, eating and relaxing together,‚Äù said Teo.‚ÄúThe virus may have spread through all of these activities, much like how it spread among family members, religious groups and even colleagues,‚Äù she added.Teo also noted that most infected workers showed mild symptoms of the virus and that many cases were uncovered only due to active case-finding or swab-taking.‚ÄúThis may explain why up to the middle of March, the cases of workers at the dormitories testing positive were few and far between. Once evidence emerged that the virus had spread in the dormitories, we decided to deal with it squarely and quickly, and mobilise whole-of-government resources,‚Äù the minister said.She added, ‚ÄúMultiple channels of transmission among migrant workers, as appear to be the case, also means that we need a multi-faceted approach to dealing with the outbreak. A narrow focus on rooming arrangements may not prevent a recurrence. This consideration underpins the comprehensive approach of the Taskforce.‚Äùhttps://sg.news.yahoo.com/covid-19-m...083406682.html","04-05-2020, 05:02 PM", [News] COVID-19: Migrant workers were on MOM's radar since January - Josephine Teo

"SINGAPORE ¬ó Foreign workers have been in the authorities¬í sight early on in the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore at the start of the year, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on Monday (4 May).Delivering a ministerial statement in Parliament, she explained how the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) helped to prevent imported cases by limiting the return of work pass holders and monitoring returnees¬í compliance with Leaves of Absence and Stay-Home Notices, among other things.¬ìThroughout this period, migrant workers were also on our radar,¬î said Teo.¬ìBack in January, soon after the multi-ministry task force was set up, MOM reached out to dormitory operators to be more vigilant and to step up hygiene. In fact, one of the earliest media conferences that Minister Lawrence Wong and I held was at the Tuas View Dormitory, after we inspected their quarantine facilities in early February,¬î she said.Wong helms the National Development Ministry and co-chairs the Multi-Ministry Taskforce tackling the spread of the virus.Teo added, ¬ìWe produced materials in the workers¬í native languages to encourage them to take steps to protect themselves.

Intermixing between blocks was stopped.¬ìMOM officers also fanned out on weekends, to advise migrant workers to observe safe distancing measures and disperse big groups that were gathering at popular hangouts.¬î¬ëNarrow focus on rooming arrangements may not prevent recurrence¬íIn February, the authorities detected the first COVID-19 cluster involving migrant workers at a construction site at Seletar Aerospace Heights. The five workers stayed at five different locations, only two of which were dormitories, Teo noted.¬ìThereafter, there was no indication of higher prevalence of COVID-19 among migrant workers, compared to the general community,¬î she said.Several MPs had raised queries on the outbreak of COVID-19 in dormitories. Jurong GRC MP Ang Wei Neng asked, among other things, about the lessons to be drawn from the management of dormitories and if safe distancing can be ¬ìpractically practised¬î in the existing purpose-built dormitories.Meanwhile, Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng asked if MOM would consider raising the minimum gross floor area of 4.5 square metres for each resident in a foreign workers' dormitory; and not including the basic living facilities - such as living quarters, kitchen, dining, and toilet areas - in the computation for the minimum gross floor area.Nominated MPs Walter Theseira and Anthea Ong also asked if a Committee of Inquiry would be appointed to probe the COVID-19 outbreak in the dormitories.Responding, Teo said epidemiological findings show that within the dormitories which have clusters, not all blocks or rooms are equally affected.

"¬ëCut back on the back-patting¬í: Singapore¬ís coronavirus response loses its shine as critics speak outPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loong¬ís government faces escalating criticism over a surge of infections at foreign worker dormitoriesMeanwhile, many citizens seem to be flouting tough ¬ëcircuit breaker¬í measures aimed at containing a resurgence in community transmissionsBhavan JaipragasPublished: 9:26pm, 10 Apr, 2020A telecast of Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong addressing the nation regarding the coronavirus. Photo: ReutersSingapore, for months hailed at home and overseas as the ¬ìgold standard¬î for responding to the Covid-19 pandemic, on Friday moved to defuse escalating criticism over how it has handled a surge in infections within foreign worker dormitories that activists had earlier flagged as public health risks due to their cramped conditions.Also weighing heavily on Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong¬ís government were signs that a sizeable number of locals were not obeying tough ¬ìcircuit breaker¬î measures ¬ñ essentially a partial lockdown ¬ñ that have been in place since Tuesday to contain a resurgence in community transmissions after initial successes in containing the outbreak.Lee, in a recorded video message on Facebook, said military medical and logistics staff had been deployed to the city state¬ís 43 foreign worker dormitories. The facilities house some 200,000 work-permit holders ¬ñ many from South Asia ¬ñ who are employed in the construction, marine and other low-wage sectors shunned by Singaporeans.Singapore migrant workers under quarantine as coronavirus hits dormitoriesLee said Teo Chee Hean ¬ñ the senior minister in charge of security affairs and a long-time trusted confidante of the prime minister ¬ñ had been instructed to oversee a new task force responsible for ensuring the migrant workers were cared for.The multi-agency task force is helmed by the commander of the army¬ís Guards Unit ¬ñ an elite rapid deployment formation.¬ìWe are paying close attention to the welfare of foreign workers,¬î Lee said in the nearly 10-minute message. The task force would ensure that workers had food and water, and Wi-fi to keep in touch with families and friends, Lee said.¬ìWe have worked with their employers to make sure they will be paid their salaries, and can remit money home. We will provide them with the medical care and treatment they need.¬îSeparately, he urged the country¬ís elderly citizens to abide by the lockdown measures. Officials have warned they may step up enforcement and penalties amid reports that residents ¬ñ a majority of whom are seniors ¬ñ continue to mingle and gather in public places.¬ìOur chances of dying are much higher, and if we get infected and spread the virus to our friends around our age, or bring the virus back home to our families, then we put them in grave danger,¬î the 68-year-old prime minister said, directly addressing ¬ìolder Singaporeans¬î.Lee¬ís address to the nation ¬ñ exactly a week after he announced the partial lockdown measures that began this week ¬ñ came as local commentators became more vocal in criticising how migrant workers were being cared for.When he spoke last week, the plaudits were still flowing in.But since then the number of confirmed infections has risen to double that of Hong Kong, with the national tally on Friday standing at 2,108 ¬ñ a nearly threefold increase over two weeks.Many of the new cases are linked to clusters in the foreign worker dormitories.Five dormitories are now on a total lockdown ¬ñ residents are expected to spend most of their time in their rooms ¬ñ while the residents of the remaining accommodation are barred from leaving the premises.Those measures are more severe than the ¬ìcircuit breaker¬î measures faced by the bulk of the city state¬ís residents, who are allowed to leave their homes to purchase food or exercise in isolation.Exacerbating the pressure on the government were media reports and accounts by activists about the conditions in one of the dormitories put on total lockdown. The Straits Times reported on Monday, based on residents¬í accounts, that urinals in toilets were overflowing and that the kitchen had a cockroach infestation.A construction worker from the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu currently living in that dormitory told ÔªøThis Week in Asia conditions ¬ñ including cleanliness in common areas and the quality of food served ¬ñ had improved significantly in the days after the report.¬ìMost of us are now worried about two things: how long will this last because it¬ís very boring to be shut in for a long time, and what happens to our jobs when this ends?¬î he said in Tamil, requesting anonymity as he believed his employer ¬ñ a mid-sized construction firm ¬ñ would disapprove of him speaking to the media. He said he spent his time singing to himself and posting video messages to his followers on the social media app TikTok.Another worker, 36-year-old Arun Singaram, a resident at the North Coast Lodge in the city state¬ís northern Woodlands district, said he had been using hand sanitisers and disinfectants regularly as the rising number of reports of migrant workers being sickened by Covid-19 worried him.While he was confident of maintaining hygiene standards inside his 12-person room, he said he was concerned about venturing into the toilet and kitchen.Officials have stressed that they have all hands on deck dealing with the fast evolving situation at the dormitories, and the Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on Monday issued a statement urging critics not to ¬ìdemoralise¬î her staff.That had little effect in containing criticism from some of the country¬ís independent political commentators ¬ñ many of whom had earlier credited the government for its fastidious approach in dealing with the crisis.In a commentary on Friday, the former newspaper editor P.N Balji questioned if the uptick in infection could have been avoided had alarm bells rung when five workers were infected in February.¬ìHow quickly fortunes can turn. It was only a few weeks ago that Singapore was smelling like roses with the country being praised, both here and abroad, for its efficient handling of the Covid-19 crisis,¬î wrote the one-time editor of the country¬ís ÔªøToday newspaper. ¬ìToday, the same government is struggling to contain the quick spread of the virus as dormitories for migrant workers open up a new battlefront.¬îA general view of Westlite Dormitory, one of the worker dormitories gazetted as isolation areas to curb the spread of the coronavirus in Singapore. Photo: ReutersOthers wondered if a March 23 warning by local migrant workers¬í rights group TWC2 had gone unheeded. The group, in a forum letter to The Straits Times, had urged the government to make public its contingency plans for mass infections in dormitories in advance.It cited how the risk of new clusters among foreign workers was undeniable because ¬ìforeign workers are housed 12 to 20 men per room in double-decker beds [and they] are transported to work on the back of lorries sitting shoulder to shoulder.¬îThen and now: Asia-Pacific landmarks emptied by the coronavirus pandemicSudhir Thomas Vadaketh, a local author, suggested in an op-ed piece that the risk had been overlooked because Singaporeans were preoccupied in self-praise over the government¬ís efforts to quarantine residents returning from abroad in posh hotels at the taxpayers¬í expense.¬ìWith many basking in Singaporean pride and glory, society¬ís gaze may have been diverted,¬î Sudhir wrote on the ÔªøNew Naratif website. ¬ìLittle, if anything, has been done to address TWC2¬ís concerns over the past two weeks.¬ìWhat can Singapore do to ensure that nobody else falls through the cracks? First, cut back on the back-patting and self-praise, and instead approach our problems with more humility and self-awareness.¬îThe welfare of Singapore¬ís low-wage migrant workers has long been a subject of controversy, although it only sporadically emerges as a subject of widespread national debate. The last time it happened was in 2013, following a riot triggered by the death of an Indian worker in a road accident.Public anger over the last week has manifested in an outpouring of donations for the workers, with an effort helmed by local social media personality Preeti Nair raising over S$215,000 (US$151,000) within 48 hours. A online petition for the government to do more to secure the rights of the workers has meanwhile obtained some 18,000 signatures.Of Singapore¬ís population of 5.7 million people, some 1.4 million people are non-residents.The city state had 284,300 foreign construction workers and 255,800 foreign domestic helpers as of June 2019, according to official data.Zhup: https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/healt...virus-response","10-04-2020, 10:49 PM"," Kena shoot by SCMP liao: Stop the ownself praise ownself ""Singapore¬ís coronavirus response loses its"

"About 250 Indians, with nearly half of them staying in close contact in the dormitories for foreign workers, have tested positive for the coronavirus in Singapore, the Indian High Commission here said on Friday.Indian High Commissioner Jawed Ashraf told PTI that almost all of the Indians who have the disease are mostly stable or improving.He said that the about 250 Indian nationals, who are suffering from the disease, include some permanent residents.Of the infected Indians, nearly 50 per cent are from dormitories for foreign workers, which have emerged as the disease spreading points in the country.The first cases from the dormitories were reported on March 29, but the number of infections has climbed to 460, of which about 200 were confirmed on Thursday.As the country has ramped up aggressive testing in the dormitories, the numbers are expected to climb in the next few days.Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the COVID-19 task force, said coronavirus cases in the foreign worker dormitories will continue to rise in the coming days and perhaps even in the coming weeks or so.""But we do have a comprehensive strategy and measures are in place, and the agencies are now working round the clock to execute and implement them,"" The Straits Times quoted the Minister as saying on Friday.Noting that foreign workers will still be providing public services such as cleaning, Wong urged people not to be prejudiced against them.""It''s not because of a foreign worker being inherently of higher risk - the risk of infection for the rest of us in the population is the same, regardless of nationality, regardless of race,"" he stressed.Singapore authorities are working to improve the living conditions in dormitories and relocating workers in other accommodations, including empty Housing Development Board flats and Army facilities, according to local media reports.Meanwhile, Indian High Commissioner Ashraf said that the post-mortem report of a 32-year-old Indian man, who died on April 8, confirmed that he passed away because of a heart condition and not due to the COVID-19 as reported earlier.The deceased was advised to stay at home after he underwent the coronavirus test on April 7.As the international flights are suspended due to the lockdown in India, it would be difficult to immediately send back the deceased''s body, an informed source said, adding Singapore authorities are expected to speak to the deceased''s family.Singapore reported 287 cases of coronavirus on Thursday, taking the total of 1,910. So far, the country has reported only 6 deaths.

"SINGAPORE - Four vacant Housing Board blocks in Taman Jurong, known as the ""diamond blocks"", are being refurbished to house foreign workers working in essential services.In a notice to residents there on Friday (April 17), Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who is MP for the Taman Jurong ward in Jurong GRC, said that works are ongoing to refurbish the vacant flats at Blocks 63 to 66 Yung Kuang Road to provide temporary housing for foreign workers, as part of Singapore's national fight against Covid-19.""Many of these foreign workers are doing important jobs that help to keep Singapore going: cleaners and maintenance workers in our neighbourhoods, those who keep our public transport running, and workers who keep electricity and water flowing to our homes,"" he wrote.He explained to residents that these workers need to be temporarily housed away from the existing worker dormitories, while the Government makes every effort to reduce and stop the spread of Covid-19 in their living quarters.""This will keep these workers safe, which will in turn help all of us stay safe,"" he wrote.The four 21-storey blocks, which are connected to form a diamond with a courtyard in the middle, are an iconic sight in Taman Jurong and have been dubbed the "" diamond blocks"" by heritage buffs.The 456-unit residential development was built by the JTC in the 1970s, with companies in the industrial zone renting the units to house their employees, including foreigners, and was later handed over to HDB.Covid-19: Don't miss the latest on the outbreak and its impactStay in the know with e-mail alertsEnter your e-mail Sign upBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions.With occupancy rates falling after the Asian financial crisis in 1997, HDB decided in 2001 to relocate remaining tenants to other rental blocks nearby, with businesses on the first two floors continuing operations.From 2009 to 2014, the blocks were used in a scheme which offered low-cost housing to people without permanent homes. In 2015, a year after the last interim housing residents were relocated, the units were spruced up for HDB's Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme. The scheme puts families in temporary homes as they wait for their new Build-To-Order flats.Mr Tharman said precautions are being taken to ensure that the new temporary housing arrangement is safe for everyone. Just like all other Singapore residents, the workers will do their part by remaining in their flats, except when they travel to work using company transport or buy essentials in the shops at the four blocks.Related StoryCoronavirus: 21 vacant HDB blocks in Bukit Merah being refurbished to house essential foreign workersRelated StoryCoronavirus: Close to 700 foreign workers housed at Home Team Academy, Civil Defence AcademyRelated StoryCoronavirus: Cruise ships assessed for feasibility to temporarily house healthy foreign workersRelated StoryAbout 5,000 foreign workers to be tested for Covid-19 in next few days, even those who are well but are contacts of confirmed casesPolice and security officers will be deployed on site to ensure that rules are followed, and there will also be a temperature screening station for the workers when they leave for work and return each day.Movements in the compound have also been organised so that residents can continue to visit the shops in Blocks 63 to 66.Besides the Taman Jurong blocks, 21 vacant HDB blocks in Bukit Merah will also be refurbished to house healthy foreign workers working in essential services.These are blocks previously under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme, which buys back from residents public housing sitting on land with high redevelopment potential for other purposes. The flats were vacated in 2018 but not yet demolished.Sport facilities which are temporarily closed are also being used to house some workers. SportSG said workers will be progressively moved to ActiveSG sport halls at Pasir Ris, Jurong West, Clementi and Hougang  from Friday (April 17).Strict protocols will be in place to manage the workers¬í entry and presence at these sport centres, a spokesman said.The Singapore Sports Hub has also converted the OCBC Arena Halls to temporarily house about 800 foreign workers from Friday, a spokesman said. The public¬ís access to the halls, including the Arena Park, will be restricted.Foreign worker dormitories have been a growing source of concern during the Covid-19 outbreak, with 19 of the 43 large purpose-built dormitories now having clusters. There are also more than 10 clusters at smaller factory-converted dormitories.About 7,000 foreign workers in essential services living in purpose-built dormitories have moved into alternative living areas, such as military camps and floating hotels.Last week, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the outbreak, said during a media conference that the number of workers in each dormitory needs to be reduced so that effective public health measures can be put in place.","17-04-2020, 05:47 PM", Coronavirus: Diamond HDB blocks in Taman Jurong to house foreign workers in essential services
Our PAP government has the foresight to reserve some empty places for situation like this.Kudos to them!,"17-04-2020, 05:50 PM", Coronavirus: Diamond HDB blocks in Taman Jurong to house foreign workers in essential services
"The increased spotlight on the plight of foreign workers and their vulnerability in the Covid-19 crisis has led to an outpouring of donations from Singaporeans despite economic hard times caused by the coronavirus.Several fundraising campaigns have smashed their targets within 24 hours, raising a total of S$345,000 in just a few days.Mr Ethan Guo, the general manager of Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), set up a fundraiser on the night of April 5 when it was reported that the Covid-19 situation was beginning to affect a large number of foreign workers in dormitories. He started receiving messages from people asking what they could do to help.The fundraiser, which was initially set at a target of S$20,000, is aimed at gathering donations to top-up foreign workers' prepaid SIM cards.¬ìI was not expecting we would even hit S$20,000. I was very surprised when I saw that we were already a quarter way there by lunchtime. By the next morning, we had already surpassed the target,¬î said Mr Guo, whose organisation promotes equitable treatment for foreign workers in Singapore.His target has been raised to S$120,000 and over S$116,000 had been collected as of 5pm on Thursday (April 9).Mr Guo decided to raise funds to top-up SIM cards after receiving feedback from workers who said that they are in need of these cards to let them keep in touch with family back home.¬ìMost of the foreign workers are now stuck in dormitories with limited or no WiFi access. They also have no means or money to top up their cards to make basic phone calls or to buy data during such a critical time,¬î he said.Mr Guo added that his team is already in the midst of consolidating names and numbers of workers they have reached out to via Facebook and word-of-mouth. The top-up will then be done for them online, he said.The number of Covid-19 cases in foreign worker dormitories has escalated quickly in the last few days with more than 20,000 workers currently quarantined in three dormitories after clusters of the infections were found.S11 @ Punggol, Westlite Toh Guan and Toh Guan Dormitory have been gazetted as isolation areas and workers are to stay in their rooms for 14 days. Covid-19 cases have also been found at Singapore's largest foreign worker dormitory Sungei Tengah Lodge, which has also been gazetted as an isolation area, as well as Tampines Dormitory and Kranji Lodge.Concerns about the virus spreading at the tight living quarters of dormitories have been raised after reports of unsanitary and crowded living conditions surfaced, prompting a petition titled ¬ìProtect our migrant workers from Covid-19¬î to be put up on Tuesday on petition website Change.org.Some of the concerns highlighted in the petition included overcrowded spaces with 12 men per room and 60 men sharing toilets. Workers also reported that meals were not being delivered on time and that there were inadequate supplies of masks, sanitisers and other essential supplies.The petition, directed to Manpower Minister Josephine Teo had garnered over 9,000 signatures out of its goal of 10,000 as of 5pm on Thursday.In a statement released on Wednesday, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said that every meal distribution exercise is now completed within two hours and portions have been increased after taking into account feedback from the workers.To cope with the increased usage of washroom facilities and higher volumes of rubbish generated due to workers now spending the entire day in the dormitories, MOM said that the frequency of refuse collection and removal have been increased from once to three or four times daily. The disinfection and cleaning of the common areas and washroom facilities are also being carried out three times per day.Beyond this Covid-19 situation, Mr Guo said the funds collected will assist foreign workers who have salary or work injury issues and those who have lost their jobs and have no income. The funds will also be used to top-up their EZ-Link cards as a single trip to the hospital or the MOM from places such as Tuas costs at least S$3 one way, he said.In support of Mr Guo¬ís campaign, social media personality Preeti Nair, 25, took to her Facebook, Instagram and YouTube pages on Wednesday morning. She urged her over 50,000 followers to donate to a fundraiser she set up on Give.asia, a fundraising campaign website, to support non-governmental organisations such as Mr Guo¬ís TWC2.In a little over 12 hours, her goal of S$100,000 was reached, and as of 5pm on Thursday had hit S$155,000.¬ìWhat I am doing is just using my platform to bridge communities. We did not expect this at all.¬î¬ìI personally thought it was a really ambitious goal so I am honestly speechless and grateful for the generosity and amount of kindness shown towards these foreign workers,¬î said Ms Nair, who set up the fundraiser in collaboration with Utopia, a group of friends hoping to raise awareness of less visible and vulnerable communities here such as foreign workers.The donations received will go to Mr Guo¬ís TWC2 top-up campaign as well as to HealthServe, another organisation which has purchased health-care bags containing personal hygiene items such as hand sanitiser, antibacterial soap and masks for these workers.Ms Nair added that she intends on keeping the page open for as long as it¬ís helpful.Ms Julia Tan, 24, who works with crowdfunding platform FundedHere, launched the ¬ë10in10: Raising 10K (S$10,000) in 10 days for Migrant Workers¬í fundraising campaign on Give.asia on Monday, alongside the Social Development Initiative Academy, a social enterprise that champions the welfare of foreign workers in Singapore.Instead of the 10-day target she had set, she raised the sum in under 24 hours, and as of 5pm on Thursday had raised S$15,000.¬ìWe were incredibly surprised at the amount of community spirit displayed. This shows that despite the racist comments you sometimes see online that perceive foreign workers to be a disposable workforce, there are still Singaporeans who are able to see that foreign workers are human too and deserve human rights,¬î she said.The donations gathered from her fundraiser will go towards providing essential hygiene kits that include face masks and hand sanitisers and dry essential food items like rice and oil.https://www.todayonline.com/singapor...19-cases-spike","09-04-2020, 06:52 PM"," S¬íporeans give S$345,000 to help foreign workers after Covid-19 cases spike in dormitories"

"SINGAPORE -  A man found motionless at a staircase landing at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital on Thursday morning (April 23) later died from his injuries.Police said in a statement that they were alerted to a case of unnatural death at the hospital at around 7.30am.The man, an Indian national, 46, was found lying motionless at the staircase landing. He later died from his injuries.Based on preliminary investigations, the police said they do not suspect foul play. They are investigating the case.The Ministry of Health (MOH) confirmed that the man was a coronavirus patient.In a statement on Thursday evening, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said it is deeply saddened by the man's death. The man's family members and employer, as well as the Indian High Commission in Singapore, have been informed, said the MOM.The ministry said the man was a construction worker and had worked for the same employer since September 2009.""Background checks do not reveal any complaints against the employer,"" the ministry added.The man had lived in a factory-converted dormitory operated by the employer, which was last inspected on April 12.""At the time, it housed nine workers, including the deceased, less than the approved capacity for factory-converted dormitories. The dormitory was found to be in an acceptable condition, including cleanliness and ventilation,"" said the MOM.Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam and Manpower Minister Josephine Teo met the man's roommates at the dormitory.""The workers were sad but calm. They reported that they have been well taken care of by the employer,"" said MOM in its statement.The workers also requested that the man's nephew, who is also employed by the same company, be allowed to pay his last respects.The MOM said it is working with the MOH to facilitate the request.In a recorded video interview, Mrs Teo encouraged any workers who need help or have any feedback to approach the MOM.""We want to assure the workers once again that we are here to help them, and if there's anything at all, they can reach out to our officers. They have the numbers, and they know how to contact us,"" she said.""This is a difficult time for all of them. We appreciate all of their contributions to Singapore and we are committed to looking after them. So whatever it is that they need, as long as they reach out to us, we will provide the support to them.""Mrs Teo also said that ""we have assured (the workers) that they will be taken care of and we will help them to recover, and they should not hesitate to step forward to seek medical attention"".""We¬íve also assured them that we will work with their employers to ensure that they continue to be paid their salaries and that they can send money home to provide for their families,"" she said.On the death of the Indian worker, Mr Shanmugam said in Tamil in a recorded video interview that the police are investigating what happened, why it happened and whether the man had other medical issues.The ministry is also working with the Hindu Endowments Board to undertake the necessary funeral arrangements for the man, as well as the Migrant Workers' Centre to provide support to his family.https://www.straitstimes.com/singapo...g-of-khoo-teck","23-04-2020, 10:10 PM", [Not so breaking] Migrant worker who died in KTPH had Covid-19 before dying at the staircase landing

"A new taskforce has been created to specifically manage the COVID-19 outbreak among foreign workers here.Announced at a COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce (MTF) virtual press conference on Thursday (9 April), the foreign worker taskforce comprises Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean as advisor, and members of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and Singapore Police Force (SPF). It has been operationalised since Monday.MTF co-chair Lawrence Wong explained that cases among foreign workers are increasing at an alarming rate, compared to the increase in the general population, which is more ¬ìstable¬î. The government therefore has to actively intervene in this ¬ìvery major and urgent issue¬î.The approach to tackling it is two-pronged, said Wong.First, the government will work together with dormitory operators to ensure effective management across all dorms. Secondly, there will be heightened public health measures in place, including active screening and testing of workers, and the provision of medical posts on-site at the dorms.Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said, ¬ìAn established, replicated, sustained approach has to be adopted. We have a responsibility to these foreign workers who have come all the way here at considerate expense to make a living in Singapore.¬îLiving conditions in dormitoriesSince Monday, steps have been taken to standardise the delivery of daily needs within the four dorms gazetted as social isolation areas. These include the timely delivery of quality meals, cleaning and removal of garbage up to three times a day and disinfection of the premises up to three times daily.These have been co-ordinated by nine-member FAST teams ¬ñ made up of SAF or SPF personnel and MOM officers ¬ñ since Monday.¬ìBy Tuesday, we had three FAST teams working with dorm operators. By Wednesday, we had put together 43 FAST teams, matching them with dorm operators,¬î said Teo. Some 400 personnel are involved in total.Standards at the dormitories have improved greatly, said Teo, and the government will replicate these measures and standards in all dormitories, regardless whether they are gazetted as isolation areas or not.This will affect some 200,000 workers in 43 dorms. More than 5,000 healthy workers who are providing essential services have already been moved out of the dorms. Places where the government is housing them temporarily include SAF military camps, Changi Exhibition Centre, floating hotels and vacant HDB blocks.The Manpower Minister also pointed out that authorities had already began taking precautions in the dormitories from end-January, with all returning work place holders required to serve Leave Of Absence (LOA) and subsequently Stay Home Notices (SHN). This policy started with China workers and was later extended to all returning workers.90,000 inspection calls were also made on those serving LOA or SHN. 90 individuals¬í work passes were also revoked in order to signal the importance of measures, said Teo.Teo said that ultimately, ¬ìWe need to thin out the dorms (and) reduce the number of people in order to have effective safe distancing measures.¬ìThis is really important, we have to get it right.¬îhttps://sg.news.yahoo.com/covid-19-t...122006700.html","09-04-2020, 08:34 PM", Taskforce set up to manage infections within foreign worker population
