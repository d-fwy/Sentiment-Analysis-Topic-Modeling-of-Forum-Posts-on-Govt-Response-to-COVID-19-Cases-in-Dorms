Future cost of operating dorms after Covid-19Jo Jo has declared that half the existing dorms owners/operators have met existing requirements.They should be fine and nade to pay penalty.  They should not be made to pay for their failure. On future cost of operating dorms, these dedicated dorms owners could still make profit but lesser with upcoming new requirements.   As mentioned, there is no lack of dorms operators as it is very profitable. Alot of larger employers, with more workers prefer to house their workers in factory converted dorms and factory with dorms because dedicated dorms operators charged very high rentals.

"Operators of these dormitories have the responsibilities to ensure the environment be safe and hygiene for the workers or the employers of these workers to rent.When hygiene and the environment failed to meet conducive state, the dormitoryâs operators are responsible. Itâs like we pay the town council to ensure our HDB environment clean, as well as our lift are well maintained. When all these failed the town council are held responsible.And in the case of these workers, the dormitoryâs operators should be held responsible for their failing to keep the living environment to be acceptable state. Which resulted the additional expenses in taking care of these foreign workers should also bear by the dormitory operators and not with public funds which the whole Singapore should pay for?Simply because the dormitory profits does not share with Singaporeans. This is just like the MRT case where the falling short of maintenance on the train system for a period of 10 years due to the former CEO cuts in maintenance budget.

"Operators of these dormitories have the responsibilities to ensure the environment be safe and hygiene for the workers or the employers of these workers to rent.When hygiene and the environment failed to meet conducive state, the dormitoryâs operators are responsible. Itâs like we pay the town council to ensure our HDB environment clean, as well as our lift are well maintained. When all these failed the town council are held responsible.And in the case of these workers, the dormitoryâs operators should be held responsible for their failing to keep the living environment to be acceptable state. Which resulted the additional expenses in taking care of these foreign workers should also bear by the dormitory operators and not with public funds which the whole Singapore should pay for?Simply because the dormitory profits does not share with Singaporeans. This is just like the MRT case where the falling short of maintenance on the train system for a period of 10 years due to the former CEO cuts in maintenance budget. That resulted our train system having many issues for a period of 4-5 years to get corrected with government help in funding. While the board of directors and the CEO continues to enjoy bonuses, this is unfair in my opinion.This is a cronyist despotic MeritocracySo dormitory profits are not shared with dumbfarks CarrotheadsBut all costs and losses are to be paid for by dumbfarks Carrotheads through increasing costs of living and particularly gstTo ensure fairness and equitable distribution it is absolutely essential to vote in alternative and competitive representation in Parliament to reverse the trend of negative TFR and other issues",14-5-2020 9:29 AM ,"Netizens praise WPâs Png Eng Huat for asking if operators, dorm owners are liable to"

"Ex-Deputy Prime Ministers Tharman and Teo Chee Hean brought in to handle manpower matters http://theindependent.sg/ex-deputy-prime...r-matters/After Senior Ministers Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Teo Chee Hean were roped in to handle manpower matters like the jobs council and the foreign worker dormitories situation, some Singaporeans are speculating whether Manpower Minister Josephine Teo was given too big a portfolio for her to cope with.Mr Tharman and Mr Teo served as Singaporeâs Deputy Prime Ministers from 2011 to 2019. The pair stepped down from their posts and became Senior Ministers on 1 May 2019, following a Cabinet reshuffle that was designed to give fourth-generation (4G) ministers more exposure and responsibilities so that they can better support the next Prime Minister who will come from their cohort.The Cabinet reshuffle saw the ruling Peopleâs Action Partyâs (PAP) 4G cohort accept several promotions that resulted in them leading two-thirds of the Governmentâs ministries. Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat kept his ministry but also succeeded Mr Tharman and Mr Teo as Singaporeâs sole Deputy Prime Minister, giving rise to speculation that he is the ruling partyâs Prime Minister designate.Besides Mr Tharman and Mr Teo, fellow veteran politician Lim Swee Say stepped down from his post as Manpower Minister and was succeeded by Josephine Teo, who became Singaporeâs second female minister to helm a ministry after Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu.While Mr Tharman and Mr Teo seemed to take a backseat to allow the younger ministers to take charge, they have now taken on important responsibilities that pertain to manpower.Current DPM Heng Swee Keat tapped on Mr Tharman to chair the new National Jobs Council. Asserting that his predecessor has âboth detailed knowledge and deep expertise in this issueâ in his latest supplementary budget speech last month, Mr Heng revealed that the National Jobs Council will focus on creating jobs and helping workers build deep skills to stay employable in the challenging economy.Mr Teo was brought in to handle the foreign worker dormitories issue after COVID-19 outbreaks in the dorms ended up infecting over 33,567 workers and counting. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that Mr Teo is playing an advisory role in the Governmentâs inter agency task force to handle the situation in the dorms.The veteran politiciansâ involvement in what are perceived as manpower matters has raised questions about the capabilities of Manpower Minister Josephine Teo.Mrs Teo was just recently under public scrutiny for the way she handled the COVID-19 outbreaks at the foreign worker dormitories. Some Singaporeans blamed the minister for allowing the COVID-19 situation to spiral out of control among migrant workers even though she was warned in advance that this might happen due to the workersâ overcrowded living conditions.When she was asked why she did not act early in implementing safe distancing measures in the dorms before the coronavirus infection spread uncontrolled, Mrs Teo did not apologise and instead blamed a lack of hindsight.Expressing a wish to ârewind the clockâ to implement safe distancing measures in the dorms earlier, she told the local press: âIf possible, I really wish to know at which stage the infection has already spread to community and migrant workers group?

"Ex-Deputy Prime Ministers Tharman and Teo Chee Hean brought in to handle manpower matters http://theindependent.sg/ex-deputy-prime...r-matters/After Senior Ministers Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Teo Chee Hean were roped in to handle manpower matters like the jobs council and the foreign worker dormitories situation, some Singaporeans are speculating whether Manpower Minister Josephine Teo was given too big a portfolio for her to cope with.Mr Tharman and Mr Teo served as Singaporeâs Deputy Prime Ministers from 2011 to 2019. The pair stepped down from their posts and became Senior Ministers on 1 May 2019, following a Cabinet reshuffle that was designed to give fourth-generation (4G) ministers more exposure and responsibilities so that they can better support the next Prime Minister who will come from their cohort.The Cabinet reshuffle saw the ruling Peopleâs Action Partyâs (PAP) 4G cohort accept several promotions that resulted in them leading two-thirds of the Governmentâs ministries. Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat kept his ministry but also succeeded Mr Tharman and Mr Teo as Singaporeâs sole Deputy Prime Minister, giving rise to speculation that he is the ruling partyâs Prime Minister designate.Besides Mr Tharman and Mr Teo, fellow veteran politician Lim Swee Say stepped down from his post as Manpower Minister and was succeeded by Josephine Teo, who became Singaporeâs second female minister to helm a ministry after Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu.While Mr Tharman and Mr Teo seemed to take a backseat to allow the younger ministers to take charge, they have now taken on important responsibilities that pertain to manpower.Current DPM Heng Swee Keat tapped on Mr Tharman to chair the new National Jobs Council. Asserting that his predecessor has âboth detailed knowledge and deep expertise in this issueâ in his latest supplementary budget speech last month, Mr Heng revealed that the National Jobs Council will focus on creating jobs and helping workers build deep skills to stay employable in the challenging economy.Mr Teo was brought in to handle the foreign worker dormitories issue after COVID-19 outbreaks in the dorms ended up infecting over 33,567 workers and counting. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that Mr Teo is playing an advisory role in the Governmentâs inter agency task force to handle the situation in the dorms.The veteran politiciansâ involvement in what are perceived as manpower matters has raised questions about the capabilities of Manpower Minister Josephine Teo.Mrs Teo was just recently under public scrutiny for the way she handled the COVID-19 outbreaks at the foreign worker dormitories. Some Singaporeans blamed the minister for allowing the COVID-19 situation to spiral out of control among migrant workers even though she was warned in advance that this might happen due to the workersâ overcrowded living conditions.When she was asked why she did not act early in implementing safe distancing measures in the dorms before the coronavirus infection spread uncontrolled, Mrs Teo did not apologise and instead blamed a lack of hindsight.Expressing a wish to ârewind the clockâ to implement safe distancing measures in the dorms earlier, she told the local press: âIf possible, I really wish to know at which stage the infection has already spread to community and migrant workers group? If time can be rewound, this is what I wish I could know.â2 LANCHIOWS 1 CB TO HANDLE SIMPLE TASK",7-6-2020 5:50 PM ,Ministers Tharman and Teo Chee Hean brought in to handle manpower matters

If I'd known, I would have done things differently. But no one can tell the next step.""Wong said that it was a very ""unpredictable"" situation where the virus spreads very quickly. He pointed out that previously, there have been cases in foreign worker dormitories. However, they ""never exploded into big clusters.""""But this time it happened,"" he said.Wong also explained that a single lapse by an individual who continues to go to work, and interact with others, can easily end up spreading the virus to many others.He emphasised a need for a proper system to screen these foreign workers, and separate the sick from the healthy.To contain the spread of the virus across the dormitories, Wong said that they have to put in all the resources they can muster.Dunno which part this LW dunno.Dunno COVID spread very fast?Dunno dorm very crowded?Dunno FWs are also human not cow and hence can kanna COVID as easily?Dunno which part he dunno",10-4-2020 3:11 PM ,"Lawrence Wong: Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of the benefit of hindsight"

"Just a tiny virus karang Kabo.If war time all just hug n cry in parliammentAs the global infection rate and death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic race upwards, people are playing the blame game, and itâs resulting in fraught relations and strained bilateral ties.Thanks to Lawrence Wongâs words, âhindsightâ is now a word in popular usage. Itâs easy for people to criticize their govtsâ handling of the virus outbreak, but they have the wisdom of hindsight. And with hindsight, govts and their virus-fighting task force can now see there were alternatives and they would do things differently.

"SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 287 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday (Apr 9), the largest daily increase so far and more than double yesterday's highest record, the multi-ministry task force dealing with the coronavirus said during a press conference on Thursday (Apr 9).This brings the national tally to 1,910.Of the new cases, 219 are linked to existing clusters, with at least 160 cases linked to the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol.A total of 19 cases are linked to previous cases, with 46 unlinked cases, the task force said. Three of the latest cases announced are imported. 314 cases have been discharged from acute care, and 705 cases have been moved to a community isolation facility, the task force said. Singapore has also seen six fatalities from COVID-19, the task force said. It was reported on Wednesday a 32-year-old Indian national died after taking a swab test, and was confirmed to have COVID-19 after his demise.READ: Day 2 of COVID-19 'circuit breaker' sees more than 3,000 breaches of safe distancing measuresThe task force said that with the help of the police and Ministry of Defence, it established a link between the  cluster at Mustafa Centre shopping mall and the Project Glory construction site as well as a number of foreign worker dormitories: S11 [emailÂ protected], Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tampines Dormitory Cochrane Lodge II  and Toh Guan Dormitory. Director of medical services at the Ministry of Health Assoc Prof Kenneth Mak described how some of the dormitory cases were linked to the Mustafa Centre cluster.""We believe that the workers had visited Mustafa and they subsequently transmitted the infection to their co-workers,"" he said.  ""Transmission most likely occurred through close contact,for example at meal times, during breaks, and also between co-workers at work due to physical proximity at work sites,"" he said.Subsequently, they could have spread the infection to colleagues and friends within the dormitories, he added. Singapore has seen a rise of COVID-19 cases at foreign worker domitories recently.Sungei Tengah Lodge became the fourth foreign worker dormitory to become an isolation area from midnight on Thursday, in a move aimed at preventing the spread of the disease.The other three dormitores that have been gazetted as isolation areas are: S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, Westlite Toh Guan dormitory and Toh Guan Dormitory.https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/sin...t-12624378",9-4-2020 8:27 PM ,Apr 9:: 287 new cases...3 imported...284 local...mostly from dormitories
"https://sg.news.yahoo.com/measures-to-ta...39249.htmlSINGAPORE â Despite having heightened surveillance and tightened precautions in Singaporeâs migrant worker dormitories early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures âturned out to be insufficientâ, said Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean on Thursday (11 June).In a 25-minute speech televised on regional broadcaster CNA, Teo pointed out to the novel coronavirus being much more infectious than its genetically-related counterpart, which causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).During the 2003 SARS outbreak, Singapore recorded 238 cases of the disease and 33 deaths.In comparison, the city-state has confirmed 39,387 COVID-19 cases, including 25 related fatalities to date. Some 94 per cent of the total are foreign workers living in dorms.âOn 25 March, we recorded zero cases in our dormitories. Just 10 days later, on 4 April, when the number increased to 26 cases, we acted decisively to isolate the dormitories,â said Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security.âHowever, the infectiousness of this virus and the communal living conditions in the dormitories meant that in a fortnight, by 20 April, we were recording more than 1,000 new cases per day in the dormitories.âWhile Singapore may have gained experience in tackling the SAR outbreak here, âno two crises are the sameâ, Teo said. The efforts to fight the COVID-19 outbreak in the migrant worker community is âa major challengeâ, he added.On the mobilisation of the Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, Teo pointed out that the task is not a mission that they have been specifically prepared and trained for.âBut they demonstrated their readiness and flexibility by stepping up to establish the joint task forces within days, to support their MOM (Ministry of Manpower) and MOH (Ministry of Health) colleagues who were already on the frontlinesâ, he noted.The taskforces had deployed teams to all the dorms to look after more than 300,000 workers and supported the MOHâs overall medical support plan.Teo reiterated that the authorities are currently testing and clearing every worker living in the dorms to ensure they are well and can safely resume work.âThe operations are still ongoing, to bring the dorm situation fully under control. But the number of daily cases has already come down to between a third and half of the peak. About two-thirds of the patients have already fully recovered,â he added.Teoâs delivery is the third in a series of national speeches by cabinet ministers, following the address by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last Sunday and National Development Lawrence Wong on Tuesday.

"The Big Read: Solving Singaporeâs foreign workers problem requires serious soul searching, from top to bottomShould society start questioning its reliance on low-cost foreign workers? Will the economy be able to cope with increased costs of raised standards? Can people accept migrant workers living in their midst?The Big Read - foreign workers in Singapore 1For the 400,000 migrant workers living in Singapore, their future could remain shrouded in uncertainty for some time. Their livelihoods here will hang in the balance even after COVID-19 has been eradicated here, say experts. (Photo: TODAY / Raj Nadarajan)By Ng Jun SenBy Justin Ong11 May 2020 06:28AM(Updated: 11 May 2020 06:30AM)SINGAPORE: Mr Syedur Rahman Liton, 34, pines for his wife back home in Dhaka, Bangladesh, as he tries to put on a brave front about possibly contracting COVID-19.For the past month or so, the lifting supervisor has been isolating himself along with 100 other company workers at a factory-converted dormitory in Senoko Loop, part of a precautionary move to socially distance migrant workers living in similar accommodation from the community at large to prevent the further spread of the novel coronavirus.It is a sacrifice that these foreign workers are making for the rest of Singapore society, experts say. As a result, the country owes migrant workers a debt of gratitude, and possibly, a concrete commitment to change when the pandemic is over. The number of COVID-19 cases has risen sharply from the first four infections detected at a foreign worker dormitory (S11 Dormitory at Seletar North Link) on Mar 30 which were part of 879 cases in total at that point in time, to 22,460 as of Saturday (May 9).Mr Liton has reason to be worried - two of his friends, Asit and Zakir, who live in the larger purpose-built dormitories, have been diagnosed with the disease and hospitalised.âWe all want to go home in good health â¦ My wife miss(es) me more and more,â he said.When asked about his prospects of remaining in Singapore in the foreseeable future amid the pandemic, Mr Liton said: âI donât think (I worry) about the future, because I understand the situation.â But for the 400,000 migrant workers living in Singapore, their future could remain shrouded in uncertainty for some time. Their livelihoods here will hang in the balance even after COVID-19 has been eradicated in the Republic, experts said.Amid the crushing impact of the circuit breaker measures and the drastic blow to the construction industry, will Mr Litonâs employer survive the economic drought that has already started? Will he still have a job in post-pandemic Singapore?The Big Read - foreign workers in Singapore 2Medical workers attend to a migrant worker outside a factory-converted dormitory in Sungei Kadut, April 28, 2020. (Photo: TODAY / Raj Nadarajan)While Mr Liton ponders over the future, his host country - Singapore - will also have to reassess its whole relationship with migrant workers like him, especially its âaddictionâ to cheap migrant labour, and examine whether the lessons learnt from the explosion of COVID-19 cases in the workersâ dormitories could be used to implement meaningful changes. In the near- to medium-term, at least, what is likely to happen will be a reduction of migrant workers here as economic conditions worsen, said labour economist Walter Theseira.âAt the same time, having fewer migrant workers means more room to make changes,â said the associate professor at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.With the renewed national attention on migrant workers, the Government has pledged to raise living standards in dormitories when the battle against COVID-19 is over.Already, there are some suggestions on what these changes can be, from having more living space per worker, more dormitories to house them, and tightening state regulations. Over the years, Singaporeâs history with migrant worker accommodation has seen a general apprehension towards housing migrant workers in the residential community.In 2008, more than 1,400 Serangoon Gardens residents signed a petition against a dormitory situated in their neighbourhood, which they handed to then National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan.But beyond the dormitories, there are also wider questions to consider, said the experts. Should society start questioning its reliance on low-cost foreign workers? Will the economy be able to cope with increased costs of raised standards? Can people accept migrant workers living in their midst?For some insights into these issues, we reached out to various stakeholders in the industry of migrant labour, such as dormitory operators, construction firms, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), as well as labour academics and policy researchers. Ultimately, nearly all those interviewed said a significant relook at how Singapore accommodates its migrant workforce, both in the literal and figurative sense, is overdue. Mr Christopher Gee, senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), said: âWe canât go back to the status quo ... We have ridden on our luck for so long and now it has come home to roost.âTHE STATUS QUOThere are about 200,000 migrant workers housed in 43 purpose-built dormitories around Singapore.These are licensed dormitories housing more than 1,000 workers each and are required to comply with the requirements under the Foreign Employee Dormitory Act (FEDA), such as providing facilities that include sick bays and isolation rooms.Dormitory operators are also required to draw contingency plans in case of a pandemic, such as providing arrangements for quarantine.Despite this, around 20 of the purpose-built dormitories - nearly half - flout the FEDA licensing requirement on average each year, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo revealed in Parliament on Monday (May 4). Operators face fines of up to S$50,000 and up to a year in jail for Feda offences.Another 95,000 workers are housed in the 1,200 factory-converted dormitories; 20,000 in construction temporary quarters; and 85,000 work permit and S Pass holders in the construction sector housed in Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats, private residential premises and others.These are not covered under the FEDA due to their smaller size, though they have to comply with other regulations such as the building and fire safety codes.Each purpose-built dormitory house anywhere between 1,500 and 25,000 workers. By law, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) prescribes a minimum of 4.5 sq m per dorm resident for living space, which includes the sleeping quarters, kitchen, dining and toilet areas. Operators have largely kept to these minimum standards, as well as other environmental health guidelines by the National Environment Agency that states that there should be one toilet facility for every 15 residents. Each room can house between 12 and 20 workers, and the beds are often double-decked.OPERATORS: DORMS NOT BUILT FOR A PANDEMICWhile the purpose-built dormitories have met the needs of the workers during ânormal timesâ, dorm operators said these large facilities were not built nor regulated to cater for a pandemic of such a scale.A spokesperson from Mini Environment Service (MES), which oversees operations at Jurong Penjuru Dorm 1, Jurong Penjuru Dorm 2, Blue Stars Dorm and The Leo, added that a dormitory âby nature is denseâ. âThe older specifications and designs of a dormitory were based on a functional approach and pandemic management was not a consideration in the design and use,â the spokesperson added.Managing Director of S11 Dormitories Johnathan Cheah said that the dormitories under his charge - S11 Dormitory @ Punggol and Changi Lodge II - are organised to accommodate residents who fall ill with infectious diseases such as chicken pox, measles and mumps.   â(The dormitories) were not designed to accommodate the large number (of infected cases) expected during a pandemic,â he said.As of Friday, S11 Dormitory @ Punggol is Singaporeâs biggest infection cluster, with 2,535 cases. When asked how the living space each worker has is allotted, the dorm operators said that this is largely up to the specifications of the authorities. Mr Cheah said that S11 Dormitory @ Punggol was âbuilt to the authorities' specifications for dormitoriesâ when constructed in 2015.   Agreeing, the MES spokesperson said: âWe donât get to decide on the living space. This is set by the authorities and the dormitories are built to specifications.â HELP FROM AUTHORITIESAs infections in dorm clusters began to rise early last month, an inter-agency task force was set up on Apr 7 to provide support to foreign workers and dormitory employers. With help from the authorities, operators have been able to lower occupancy rates within the dormitories. Mr Kong Chee Min, the chief executive officer of Centurion Corporation, who is in charge of ASPRI-Westlite Papan, Westlite Juniper, Westlite Mandai, Westlite Toh Guan and Westlite Woodlands, said that the leased tenancy of these dorms averaged 95 per cent or higher, while the actual residency was around 85 per cent. The Big Read - foreign workers in Singapore 3General view of Westlite Dormitory in Toh Guan, April 30, 2020. (Photo: TODAY / Raj Nadarajan)Thanks to the âconcerted decamping efforts supported by multiple parties nationallyâ in the wake of the pandemic, occupancy has been brought down to about 65 to 70 per cent on average. âOn average, there are now about five or six persons living in an eight-bed apartment, and eight to nine persons in a 12-bed apartment,â said Mr Kong. Likewise, the operator at S11 Dormitory @ Punggol has been âworking very closelyâ with the authorities to curb the spread of the virus. For example, the residents are required to stay in their assigned rooms and cannot come into contact with the other residents in different levels and blocks. This measure is part of a three-pronged strategy announced by Manpower Minister Teo on Apr 14. FUTURE HOPES FOR DORMSThe operators hope that the next couple of years will bring improvements to the conditions and living standards within the dormitories. âA review of standards for dormitory operations can only be good for the foreign worker community as it will help to raise quality levels across the industry,â said Mr Kong. Agreeing, the MES spokesperson said that the ability to âtear downâ the dormitories with older specifications and update them will âbenefit all stakeholdersâ.The issues which the operators would like to address include the long-standing conundrum of safe distancing.  âIf we are to prepare for future pandemic situations, the density of the dorm population needs to be addressed and employers need to set aside higher budgets for rentals, for instance,â said Mr Cheah of S11 Dormitories. Beyond deciding where to house the workers, employers also play a âmajor roleâ in regulating the way employees use the premises, operators say.Mr Kong said: âWe do see employers who rent 12-bed apartment units, then choose to house only 10 or less workers in the apartment.âEMPLOYERS: ""OUR HANDS ARE TIED""While migrant workers are covered by Singaporeâs main labour law, the Employment Act, employers of migrant workers also generally assume a greater responsibility for their welfare, including food accommodation and healthcare, than if they had hired a local resident to do the same job.But while employers in the construction sector agree that changes to how migrant workers are housed are needed, several said the influence they have on their workersâ living conditions is limited. It is largely not up to the employers to dictate the density or the living conditions within the dormitories, but for the operators to decide and the authorities to regulate, they claimed.  Mr Johnny Lim, executive director of Teambuild Engineering & Construction, noted that purpose-built dormitories are often densely populated due to the shortage of land and âconcerns that these dormitories are in too close proximity to residential areasâ.Mr Chew Char Choon, senior project manager of a real estate construction firm, said: âAs a contractor or dorm operator, we just take instructions from (the authorities) ... It is up to the Government, how they would like to control.â READ: COVID-19: Crowding, emotional health of migrant workers at dormitories concern employersWhile maximum room capacity and space for each worker may be set by the operators with prevailing regulations in mind, some employers may choose to house their workers in more spacious environs - but at a cost. Mr Nelson Tee, managing director of CHH Construction System, has been housing his 39 workers in three dormitory rooms that can hold a total of 48 workers.  He pays S$369 per worker monthly for their accommodation when he could have been paying S$300 had he housed them to full capacity, and has been doing so before the pandemic. âI book them for three rooms so I can spread them out,â he said.MORE SPACE WILL COME AT A COSTShould new guidelines cause housing to be more costly, not all contractors may be able to stomach this, the employers said. This is especially if they have long-term projects underway, some of which can last four to five years. Mr Chew said that should dormitories charge higher rates per worker, it would ânot be fair to ongoing contracts, which are tendered based on old pricingâ. âWhen the new guidelines come inâ¦ it will affect (employersâ) cashflow.â At the end of the day, some employers think it boils down to who would be willing to shoulder and split the extra costs. Mr Akbar Kader, managing director of Nan Guan Construction, said that he would like to see a âsymbiotic arrangementâ between the employer, dormitory operators, and the authorities, such that the extra costs are fairly distributed among them.  He added that a maximum rental charge would also make future operators more mindful during the tendering process - when they bid for the price of land on which to build their dormitories.   Exorbitant bids will be fewer if operators âknow that they would have to provide specified facilities and meet operational requirements, and charge no more than what has been stipulated as the (maximum) price for rental of a bed spaceâ, he said. If all the above is carried out, âthe increment in cost (to the consumers) over the time they own the property will be very minuteâ, said Mr Akbar.  Some employers think that consumers should also see beyond the economic cost of the product and be mindful of the workersâ efforts that go behind it.Mr Kenneth Loo, executive director of Straits Construction Singapore, said that most Singaporeans are not aware of the workersâ hard work, and the tough living conditions they have to put up with.âHow much people are willing to pay depends on the economy (rather than the workersâ living conditions),â he said. âFor example, when you buy a piece of clothing, do you think of where it comes from? No, right?â The Big Read - foreign workers in Singapore 4An empty room at Westlite Papan dormitory on Apr 21, 2020, after workers in essential services were moved out. (Photo: TODAY / Nuria Ling)A PUSH TOWARDS AUTOMATIONOver the years, some employers have also turned to technology to help reduce their reliance on foreign labour. For example, Mr Lim from Teambuild Engineering & Construction said the firm focuses on prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction (PPVC), whereby entire rooms are first prefinished and fitted out in factories with the use of automation and machinery, before being transported on-site for assembly. These new construction methods âeffectively transferred major portions of the work previously carried out on the construction sites into the factoriesâ, he said.However, there is a limit to automation. Unless technological advancement allows machines to âfunction like tradesmenâ and be available, accessible and affordable, âconstruction will remain a labour-intensive industryâ, Mr Lim said. While both dorm operators and employers say their hands are tied when it comes to housing, commentaries over the past several weeks have jointly blamed the inadequacies by both parties for the outbreak.Experts say the time will come for a review to identify where the lapses are.Assoc Prof Theseira said: âEmployers and operators are quite a diverse group. Some appear to have neglected their responsibilities, others have simply been overwhelmed, and others still have discharged their responsibilities well. We really need some time to identify who did well and who didn't, and hold those who failed to account.âGOVERNMENT: ROLE AS REGULATORAs the authorities hunker down to mitigate the viral spread, the Government is also looking into new housing arrangements for migrant workers who have recovered from COVID-19 through a pipeline of short, medium and long-term plans, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong.Mr Wong co-chairs the multi-ministry task force leading Singaporeâs response to the COVID-19 outbreak.While details of these plans are not yet known, several suggestions have been raised, most notably, to increase the minimum standard for living space specified in FEDA.After all, it is too much to expect private operators and employers to do so on their own, said Mr Alex Au, vice-president of migrant worker rights group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2).âEmployers and dorm operators have to watch their bottom lines. They are not welfare services. If the legal standards are low - which we feel they are currently - they would be foolish as profit-making enterprises to over-provide and drive up their own costs. âThat's what the Government is for - to ensure socially-conscious minimum standards, but to do so in an across-the-board way so that a level-playing field for all businesses is maintained,â he said.Mr Au called for a doubling of the living space per occupant to 9 square metres - equivalent to 10 workers living in a four-room HDB flat.Assoc Prof Theseira, a Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP), said a proper study is needed to determine what construes a reasonable standard for living space. âIf we come up with one set of standards for living for Singaporeans in a similar situation, for example, a long-term hostel, dormitory, or army camp residents, it would be quite unjust to apply a lower standard to migrant workers just because they are migrant workers,â he said.The Migrant Workersâ Centre (MWC) also urged for changes to the FEDA to include all migrant worker housing facilities regardless of their size or type, stripping away the 1,000-bed threshold which allows the law to kick in. Said MWC chairman and former Member of Parliament Yeo Guat Kwang: âThis is something MWC has been calling for since the enactment of FEDA, on the evidence that the majority of the sub-par housing facilities we see and investigate in the course of work continue to come from factory-converted, or smaller dormitory facilities.âOther suggestions from MWC include a minimum dormitory staff to residents ratio, so as to ensure that operators have sufficient manpower to carry out crucial work such as cleaning, operations support and security. More open green space should also be part of the dormitory requirements, which would allow for recreation and communal activities.Labour economist Kelvin Seah from the National University of Singaporeâs (NUS) Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences said that these plans should include strategies to raise the hygiene standard in dormitories.âFor instance, the plan may want to prescribe the regularity in which toilets, kitchens, and rooms would be cleaned, and the sanctions which dorm operators or employers may face if they fail to comply,â said the senior lecturer.But these suggestions would likely lead to substantially higher costs of housing migrant workers, added Dr Seah. DBS bank analyst Ling Lee Keng, who frequently reports on the commercial performance of the purpose-built workers accommodation sector, said that a more stringent law could result in a cutback in the supply of beds.âThat could benefit the dormitory operators that are able to meet the higher operating requirements - bigger rooms and better facilities would naturally lead to higher cost per bed,â said the analyst, who had previously predicted that raised standards could lead to a consolidation in the industry.A MORE DIRECT ROLE FOR THE GOVERNMENTAside from regulations, could the Government also play a more active role in dormitory management?Speaking at an IPS webinar on Wednesday, Associate Professor Jeremy Lim, who is the co-director of Global Health at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS, noted the existence of two separate âmental modelsâ that the authorities had for migrant workers and for the larger Singapore community.The policy response was guided by these mental models, that although migrant workers are part of the community, there are separate paradigms for the two groups, he said.READ: COVID-19: 'Not true' Singapore has reduced testing among migrant workers, says Gan Kim YongEmployers of migrant workers assume the responsibility for the workersâ welfare, including healthcare, accommodation and food. Assoc Prof Lim said this is evident from the onset of the pandemic when the MOM asked dormitory operators to step up hygiene measures and issued advisories to employers.âAs it became clear that employers were overwhelmed in terms of safe distancing and (providing) face masks, everything fell apart and the Government had to step in. To their credit, the Government mentally pivoted away from this mental model â¦ quickly,â he said, noting the speedy establishment of community care and recovery facilities to house affected workers.Several observers had mixed feelings about the Government playing a more direct role in day-to-day dormitory management. Such services are best provided by the private market, said Dr Seah.But the Government could also take a leaf from the book for public transport operators which do not own the buses and trains, or from how the management of state-owned buildings are tendered out to commercial service providers.Assoc Prof Theseira said: âHaving dormitories owned by the Government, and then managed on a competitive basis by private companies accountable both to workers and the Government, may be an interesting model to consider.âTWEAKING SINGAPORE'S ECONOMIC MODELA more fundamental question would be whether Singapore should continue to rely heavily on low-cost migrant workers, said experts.In Singapore, past crises have historically led to a rethinking of the Republicâs social compact - the combined series of unprecedented crises such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001, the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the global financial crisis of 2008 required national responses that âthrew our planning out of gearâ and necessitated the 2013 Population White Paper, said then Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean.With Singapore now facing what has been touted as  âa crisis of a generationâ, some, like Assoc Prof Theseira and fellow NMP Anthea Ong, have called for a committee of inquiry into the foreign worker dormitory outbreak to work out the structural changes that Singapore sorely needs.In his reply to the NMPsâ call, Minister Wong told Parliament on Monday that the Government will review its overall response to the pandemic comprehensively in order to learn and improve.Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has also set up an Emerging Stronger Task Force, which is tasked with making recommendations on how to reimagine Singaporeâs economic strategies.One silver lining, from a policymaking perspective, is that the current worries about Singaporeâs overreliance on migrant workers are aligned with the Governmentâs goal of raising the productivity of the resident workforce.This dates back to 2012, when then Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said the easy availability of foreign labour will reduce the incentives for companies to raise productivity. Since then, Singapore has taken steps to progressively reduce this reliance, such as tightening the foreign worker dependency ratio ceilings, said Dr Seah.âThere is scope to reduce this reliance even further. By encouraging companies to rely less on foreign labour in their production processes, we can in fact nudge them to adopt smarter and less costly methods of production,â he added.Associate Professor Kenneth Paul Tan, from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, said he hopes the review on dormitories, when it comes, will take in diverse voices from civil society in policy discussions.âAnd I hope, most of all, that we have deeper discussions with a view to minimising our dependency on low-waged migrant workers, investing in productivity-enhancing technology, redesigning essential jobs to overcome unnecessary stigma, and designing more generous social safety nets for the many who will have difficulty integrating into a new and more resilient economic society.âPEOPLE: SOCIETYâS APPETITE FOR CHANGEIPSâ Mr Gee said that this traditional mindset of relying on lower-skilled and low-wage labour has created a âcategory of residents who have limited rights as a non-permanent resident foreigner and are treated differentlyâ.If Singapore decides that in a post-pandemic world, it needs to elevate their living standards to a decent level that Singaporeans can accept for themselves, then another question will be what level would Singaporeans be comfortable with, said Mr Gee. âThe same level as the lowest-paid Singaporean household? Or lesser? We have to negotiate and discuss this,â he said.And then, there is also the matter of cost that society needs to bear.READ: MOM says working to improve conditions for S11 Dormitory, Westlite Toh Guan residentsLast month, amid the outbreak in the dormitories, Mrs Teo said that each time MOM attempts to raise the standard of living in these premises, it would face objections from employers due to the added costs that come with the move.âNevertheless, I hope the COVID-19 episode demonstrates to the employers and wider public that raising standards at worker dormitories is not only the right thing to do but also in our own interests. We should be willing to accept the higher costs that come with higher standards,â she said. In this fundamental re-think of the role migrant workers play in Singaporeâs prosperity, TWC2âs Mr Au urged the authorities to also look beyond living standards in dormitories, such as long-standing issues on the recruitment fees that migrant workers bear and the non-payment of salaries.Assoc Prof Theseira said: âFundamentally, the current structure is low-cost, and as a result, generally Singaporeans benefit in the narrow sense that we pay lower prices for anything produced by foreign workers.ââEither our costs would go up, meaning more taxation, or standards would fall, meaning more potholes, uncleared fallen trees, et cetera, without so many low-cost workers. âThat means that we have collectively contributed to current conditions for foreign workers, because we have found these low costs and high standards of service too compelling to raise too many questions about their treatment and the market structure,â he added.SINGAPORE ATTITUDES TOWARDS MIGRANT WORKERSSo, are Singaporeans willing to pay for the higher costs that will inevitably arise from offering migrant workers a better deal? The jury is still out, based on past experience, according to the experts interviewed. The empirical evidence suggests that the mindset of Singaporeans towards migrant workers has not changed, despite an outpouring of sympathy whenever a major incident occurred.At the IPS webinar, MWC executive director Bernard Menon lamented that despite past events such as the SMRT bus driver strike in 2012 and the Little India riot the following year, the momentum arising from the online discourses on worker welfare would eventually peter out.âWe have a lot of people coming up and saying âyou should improve this, you should improve thatâ,â said Mr Menon.âBut unfortunately, though you can obviously tell that thereâs been a gradual increase over time of interest and concern â¦ this has lagged behind the expectations Iâve had during these crises.â Most recently, in December last year, the International Labour Organization and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women jointly published a detailed study into society attitudes towards migrant labour in Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. The study included both work permit holders working in the construction industry and foreign domestic workers as part of their report.It found that overall support for migrant workers had decreased in the past nine years, when a similar study was conducted in 2010. âKnowledge regarding migrant workers across the four countries remains low, and discriminatory attitudes prevail with significant numbers of members of the public in migrant destination countries stating that migrant workers should not enjoy equal working conditions with nationals,â the report stated.The study found that 36 per cent of the 1,005 Singapore respondents believed migrant workers should not receive the same work conditions as local workers, or be entitled to join a union. Around 40 per cent said migrant workers who end up exploited only have themselves to blame, a majority - 60 per cent - disagree that migrant workers should receive the same pay and benefits as nationals, and 53 per cent said migrant workers threaten the countryâs culture and heritage.Nevertheless, a majority of the Singaporean respondents (58 per cent) recognised that migrant workers had a net positive effect on Singaporeâs national economy.A ROUND OF SOUL-SEARCHINGWith the pandemic forcing Singapore - as a collective - to pay the price for years of apparent neglect, commentators said that after COVID-19 is eliminated, Singapore needs to openly embark on some serious soul-searching.For a start, the societyâs mindset and attitude towards migrant workers need to âundergo a sea changeâ, said Associate Professor Eugene Tan from the Singapore Management University.âSG United must include migrant workers from the get-go ... We cannot, as a society, seek to harness the benefits of their being here and yet not prepare to bear the costs of their being in our midst. We cannot continue to have the gains privatised but the costs socialised in our migrant worker policy,â the law don said.As Singapore figures out its next steps for migrant workers, the workers are also trying to figure out theirs as they mill around in their rooms within the various dormitories dotting Singapore keeping a distance from everyone else.The Big Read - foreign workers in Singapore 5Mr Syedur Rahman Liton and his friend Asit at a poetry event in Singapore in 2017.

"The government had a major blind spot. https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020...rkers.htmlJust last month, some East and Southeast Asian countries were held up as models for their coronavirus responsesâespecially Singapore and Taiwan, which had largely contained the outbreak despite close economic, geographic, and cultural ties to China, the pandemicâs original epicenter. Some have continued to fare well. Taiwan, with only 428 confirmed cases, has managed to avoid a lockdown. Even South Korea, despite an alarming rate of infection in early March, has flattened its curve. But Singapore now has the largest recorded outbreak in Southeast Asia. Between its first case on Jan. 23 and March 23, Singapore reported fewer than 510 known cases of COVID-19. Now, it has more than 11,000Despite Singaporeâs early vigilance in addressing the pandemicâincluding extensive contact tracingâthe governmentâs response had a blind spot. The key to what happened lies in how Singapore, a country of 5.8 million people, has treated its migrant workers.Singapore relies on foreign labor to build and maintain its gleaming infrastructure. But about 300,000 of the countryâs low-wage migrant workers, mostly from South Asia, live in dense dormitories on the outskirts of the island nation.* Rights groups and activists worried early on about the governmentâs negligence of the migrant population. In March, Transient Workers Count Too, or TWC2, a Singaporean nonprofit dedicated to improving conditions for migrant workers, warned of a potential cluster outbreak in the dorms, where itâs impossible to socially distance. Migrants often sleep 12 to 20 per room, in bunk beds, and theyâre packed into the back of trucks on their commute to work each day. Some told the Guardian the shared bathrooms often donât have soap or enough water for showers or toilets. The group also noted that employer policies often discourage workers from admitting theyâre ill or seeking medical help. âThe risk of a new cluster among this group remains undeniable,â TWC2 wrote.Over the past few weeks, as COVID-19 has traveled through the dorms, Singapore has quickly lost control of its outbreak. (While the country was initially worried about a second wave from Singaporeans returning home from overseas, those cases have been largely controlled.) The Ministry of Health said that 982 of the 1,037 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday were migrant workers. About 80 percent of all cases in the country can now be traced to the dorms.âThis reflects the deliberate invisibilization of the foreign worker; the whole machinery of state operates as though they donât exist,â Alex Au, vice president of TWC2, told the Washington Post.Singapore has responded to the outbreak by introducing a partial lockdown in the country, which has shuttered most workplaces and staggered the days individuals can go to supermarkets, until at least June 1. The government has moved 7,000 workers, mostly in essential jobs, out of the dorms, the Guardian reported, but about 293,000 remain. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong wrote in a Facebook post last week that the government is building up its health care and isolation infrastructure to reduce the âchain of transmissionâ in migrant housing. On Tuesday, the government announced a quarantine for the dorms and said that it is setting up medical facilities and triage clinics there to ensure workers get adequate care. âIt will take some time to show results, so we must expect to see more dorm cases for a while longer,â Lee wrote in the Facebook post.Singaporeâs outbreak serves as a cautionary tale for neglecting marginalized communities during a pandemic. Itâs hard not to see parallels between Singaporeâs migrant workers and the U.S.âs underclass of essential workers who labor without the necessary safety protections, or our undocumented farmworkers who are somehow considered both âessentialâ and âillegalâ (and are even being detained on the job). Singaporeâs preparedness for COVID-19 is something other countries have only aspired to: Itâs implemented aggressive contact tracing and widespread testing and is home to a robust health care system and an efficient government that can enforce strict home quarantines. And yet it has shown us that, without looking after societyâs more vulnerable members, those measures wonât be enough.",24-5-2020 8:41 PM ,Singapore Contained the Coronavirus for Months.
