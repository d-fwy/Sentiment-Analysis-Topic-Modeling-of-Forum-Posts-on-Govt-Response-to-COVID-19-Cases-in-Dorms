> SINGAPORE: Some people are deliberately spreading fake videos to ""foment trouble"" in foreign worker dormitories, Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said on Wednesday (Apr 29).

> These videos can lead to serious law and order incidents, he said, adding that the authorities were watching individuals who spread the videos ""very carefully"" and will charge them if a crime was committed.

> His comments come as hundreds of thousands of foreign workers have been barred from leaving their dorms to curb the spread of COVID-19, as they make up a majority of Singapore's new cases each day.

> Amid this situation, Mr Shanmugam said a number of fake and ""very malicious"" videos were circulating on social media, with one suggesting that a Bangladeshi worker in Singapore had committed suicide because of a lack of money and work.

> 

> Another video purportedly showed two men of South Asian origin fighting in a dorm in Singapore, when in fact the incident took place in Dubai, Mr Shanmugam said.

> ""It's to create panic, unhappiness, anger and hopefully violence,"" Mr Shanmugam told reporters via video conference. ""When people panic in such situations and get angry, they can of course riot.""

> Mr Shanmugam said the videos also serve to make Singaporeans believe that foreign workers here were being treated badly, despite authorities ensuring they continued to get paid, three meals a day and ""first-class medical treatment"".

> 

> The minister acknowledged that while it was impossible that every worker would be satisfied with the quality of the free meals, a ""majority of them"" said the quality of the food they received was good.

> ""But even now, people are deliberately circulating old photographs of food packets; sometimes food being thrown away from some places, not necessarily Singapore, and saying, 'you see, these workers are being ill-treated',"" he said.

> 

> ""And also encouraging them to come out and complain, even when there's nothing to complain about.""

> Mr Shanmugam said the authorities were watching the people who spread these videos and photos ""very closely"" and added ""where it's clearly criminal, we will charge"".

> However, he declined to give details on how many people were being investigated for circulating such posts, only adding that they comprised both locals and foreigners.

> 

> Mr Shanmugam reiterated that such posts could lead to ""serious"" law and order situations, including a ""riot-like situation"".

> ""You can see that when people are together and they are not going out to work, a small spark can create a serious incident,"" he said, referring to the Little India riots that took place in 2013.

> ""We need to be very careful. We are taking care of them, but at the same time they can be stoked into anger, creating law and order incidents through the use of falsehoods.""

Foreign worker dorms,"Is anyone else really bloody worried about the foreign worker dorms? They are currently being 'locked in' by police and the dorm is served as an isolation area. 

On one hand their dorms are being turned into prisons because they are not allowed out, the ethical aspect of this is hard to really wrap my head around, but I don't have a better solution at all. This seems very similar to a complete lockdown like in Wuhan city itself or Daegu

On the other hand, even if we disregard the welfare of the individuals inside. The ventilation inside and the conditions must be god awful, all of these will no doubt contribute to a much higher chance of the virus being spread at an alarming rate. Think of all the cases regarding cruise ships(restricted air flow, close contact with other people), this feels to me like what the workers dorms are. It's a potential cesspool for the virus and a time bomb waiting to explode. If even 20% of the current people under isolation get infected, that's already 4000 people. That would wreck our medical resources and that's when the mortality is going to shoot up drastically","I have been to a number of dormitories, even multiple times in a single dormitory and it is simply not as abysmal as how you portray it to be. First of all it is definitely not a prison, usually in dormitories there are leisure areas: street soccer and basketball courts being more common while some even have gyms that are equipped enough for the general gym goer(dumbbells and machines) and multi purpose halls that can be used to play badminton. Normally there's also WiFi in each room because the workers all come together and subscribe to one isp so it's not like they have nothing to do when they're in their bunks during their free time. Secondly, they are not locked in their rooms, they are free to wander around the dormitories. I will not assume that they are allowed to use the leisure facilities but if they want to go out and take a walk for a breathe of fresh air it's highly possible. There's also shop(s) in the dormitories that allow them to buy groceries and such although some that I have talked to prefer buying outside because these shops tend to charge higher prices. 

To the point of the conditions of rooms. Generally most rooms are clean . The cleanliness isn't top notch but it's definitely well kept and I'm fine with it. Having said that, cleanliness is also directly dependent on the actions of those living in the room; I have gone to different rooms in the same building and it isn't the same. Some rooms are clean while others have baby cockroaches running around. Ventilation is also usually not a problem, fans are provided in the dorms and not once have I broken a sweat while working in their rooms. I've even worked when all the workers return home from work and it isn't as warm as you think. I've gone to some residential houses where the conditions are worse than a dormitory. Smelly, messy with horrible ventilation. 

To put it simply, yes some of their residential areas aren't ideal. But it's satisfactory in the sense that it's clean and they have areas to be alone or if they want to enjoy the company of others. Workers can't change their living conditions but they have the ability to decide how clean they want their bunks to be. Yes I'm aware that there are companies or dormitories that do not care about the welfare of workers and workers are forced into dormitories with unliveable conditions but I can safely say that its the minority. Please do not write such things about the condition of their living areas when you don't know much about them especially when you've not even been in their rooms because it is painting a  picture based on your false perception which will misguide the public while being unfair for companies/bosses that really take care of their workers.",2020-04-08 08:37:27

But once its occupied, it's just a matter of time before it becomes filthy, and infested with cockroaches, and God forbid bedbugs.

Even if they do have amenities, it's within their walked ""prison"". They get randomized checks, and they have keycards which record their check-in and checkout times.

And i believe some dorms institute a curfew and movement restrictions at night. So not exactly free, more like a detention center, and a paid one at that.",2020-04-08 10:29:30

It takes an extreme case and a real hazard to public health to get the ministries to force employers and dorm operators to do something. The foreign worker situation was already a ticking time bomb which exploded during the 2013 Little India riot. 

I'm surprised to see that some SGers don't know how little the typical Bangla earns - $17-$18 a day. Yeah, that's a lot back in rural Bangladesh BUT they pay SG prices for food etc and there's the huge payment for the middlemen.

HDB and other developers are reaping in HUGE profits by exploiting these workers. They don't need to invest in safer or more efficient equipment and practices - why rent more machinery when you can get a bunch of Banglas to do the work by hand (literally). Developers don't pass the savings to buyers anyway, so there's nothing to be lost by paying workers more and giving them decent welfare.

In other developed countries (ex the Emirates), construction workers are paid professional wages, have decent working conditions. There's a construction site along my commute (this is pre-lockdown days) and I was struck by the difference between a US site and the SG sites I was used to seeing: There's a much fewer workers, everyone is wearing proper protective gear and workers seem healthy and well-fed! OK, the last part might seem weird to non-SGers but those who are not from these parts will be shocked to see the scrawny workers wearing old helmets and ill-fitting boots, working on SG sites.",2020-04-08 22:18:47

When there’s a confirmed cluster and advice has been given to reduce social distancing, why are some of them still standing at the corridors looking down on crowds congregating on the ground floor? That’s only going to worsen the outbreak. 

My NS and reservist was served in a compound with just such living conditions. 
The bunk beds were packed so close together that I could touch the edge neighboring bunk bed when I reach my arms out from my bed. There was no metal cabinets between as there was just no space for it. 
There was a table in the middle of the room but if people were to sit there, you wouldn’t be able to walk to the other side of the room - you had to walk out of the room and go to the other side via the corridor. 
As NSFs we brought in our own fans as the air circulation in the room was just shit. 
During reservist, the building I was housed in had problematic pipes. You’d better be the first or second batch of people to bathe as the whole bathing area will be flooded up to the ankle if you were slow. 


As much as the foreign workers are housed in less than ideal conditions that many of us wouldn’t want to live in given a choice, they made the choice to come to Singapore to earn money. There are conscripts who have to spend 2 years of their lives in such conditions as well, without a choice.",2020-04-08 09:44:32

If living conditions were as bad as what people on Reddit think they are I believe we would've seen recurring instances of sicknesses within these dorms over the years prior to Covid, things like gastro outbreaks etc.

Don't get me wrong, I firmly believe things could be vastly better re conditions for these workers. They don't get access to any care when injured, such as physiotherapy, and instead get sent back to their home country as they are deemed a burden on their employer.

If u are wondering how we gained access to these shophouses, it's coz one of my proj mate's dad is a contractor and he allowed us access to the shophouses dorms.

So this is what I have observed and it's based on my perspective, first floor is their kitchen and toilet/laundry area and second floor is their bunk beds where they sleep.

First floor when I step in, it's the kitchen, there were dead cockroaches and ants crawling around. There were one foreign worker in charge of meal at the time, preparing meals for everyone (they all were given a role in the dorm) the quality of the food was subpar, for example vegetable was full of holes and yellowish and eggs were already past the expiration date. (They had no choice as they were given these food to cook their meals as some do not wish to spend their money on groceries) 

Toilet was dirty and really smelly and black mold could be seen everywhere in the toilet. 

In the second floor, they slept in bunk beds with mattresses, however their mattresses were really thin and stained. Their personal belongings could be seen scattered everywhere on the floor as there were no cupboard or tables for them to store securely. Just bunk beds. 

I told myself after seeing the living condition of shophouses converted dorms that I took many things for granted and really respected these foreign workers even more. I managed to snap pics of the area even tho I was not allowed to take pictures.",2020-04-08 13:19:59

My point in the post was two pronged: the first was that yes, we can do better for the foreign workers regardless of what their current living situation is

My second point is that the dormitories in isolation are currently blockaded by police now. I don't know if you saw the photo where a foreign worker showed that there was a large group of workers that were trying to get out and couldn't because the entrance was blocked off. Like I said, they can and should be in isolation given that there are potentially more infected within the dorms, my main point about this post is that social distancing is not being maintained, multiple people are in a single room living and sleeping together. This is incredibly conducive to the spread of the virus. I don't have a solution to this, I am merely worried for the situation over the next week",2020-04-08 11:30:46

That would wreck our medical resources and that's when the mortality is going to shoot up drastically","I'm not sure if your view of it being filthy should be generalised. My experience is based on rooms that have always been occupied and dormitories that have existed for quite some time. In fact, I have even been to westlite dormitory at toh guan where it's currently a cluster. The whole bunk including kitchen, ""living room"" and bed room is slightly smaller than others that I have been to but ventilation is still not a problem. Again, I reiterate my same points: there are rooms which are dirty but there are also rooms that are clean in that dormitory. I strongly believe it is the role of the occupants in the room to maintain the cleanliness of the room.

Regarding the amenities, most dormitories are located in areas that are ulu and closer to industrial estates. This means that they lack leisure facilities which are usually located in neighbourhood estates. As a result, most dormitories cater these facilities for their occupants within the dormitory itself. For westlite at tohguan, you can check it out here "" https://www.centurioncorp.com.sg/portfolio/westlite-toh-guan/"".

Security guards may patrol the facility but I do not believe residents are checked. In order to enter the building itself, you must have a specialised card or something and it only allows entry if you are a resident so that may record their enter and exit timings but how does it affect occupants? Occupants of a room then have another physical key just for their room so there is no enter and exit timings for their room if that is what you are implying. 

The curfew and movement restrictions at night is intended to keep the noise level down in the facility and prevent gatherings in the middle of the night. In the dormitory itself not all workers work 8-5. There are workers who work different shifts and in the same room, meaning there may be workers working am shift while the other half work pm shift. With the curfew and movement restriction, i believe that is their true intention so that there is no unnecessary disturbance to other residents.

In actuality it's not a detention centre. It's a specific type of housing unit meant for temporary and not long term occupants. Yes their living accommodations are paid for by companies hiring them but it's not free. It seems free but it's deducted from the company's budget that is one of the reasons why their salary is lower as compared to a local.",2020-04-08 11:23:17

Yes, I definitely agree with you regarding the treatment of workers. Majority of these workers are some of the nicest people I've met. Most of the time they are very friendly and some even offer their assistance when I'm doing my work. One of my most memorable experiences is that one of the workers even asked me if I wanted coffee because he wanted to make it for me. I work mostly in people's homes and don't expect much from anyone but some Singaporeans really treated me like a dog while these foreign workers treated me as a friend. Most of the time when I'm there I always ask if their bosses treat them well and I've not heard anyone say bad things about their bosses. Some even tell me their bosses bring them out to eat and pay for them as well. So I'm grateful and thankful that not all bosses treat their workers as dispensable like what you mentioned. 
One thing I cannot get over is that there is a minority of people taking advantage of the foreign workers by preying on their gullibility and lack of knowledge. For example some rooms have WiFi extenders which obviously are not needed but the workers are convinced to buy them because of salespersons simply telling them that the product is good and that they need it for ""better"" WiFi all for the sake of commission.",2020-04-08 08:57:39

My opinion is based from experiences going into specifically built dormitory buildings and facilities and interacting with foreign workers residing in them such as westlite at toh guan. I estimate these dormitories are usually the size of a 4 or 3 room HDB flat with 1 room, a little smaller than the size of a tekong bunk as their sleeping areas consisting of multiple double decker beds. Usually they also have two more rooms, one for a living room and another for a kitchen but the sizes vary across the different dormitories. They also have a toilet in each bunk. Some bunks have TVs inside which they use to normally watch cricket.

In each bunk there's also a designated cook. As for things to eat, they usually buy their own raw ingredients to cook with. One of the reasons I like going to dormitories is apart from the friendly people is that the food they cook smells good. The smell of rice is always present especially in the evenings. 

I understand that my experiences should not be generalised to all but I believe what you mentioned is the minority and such treatment of foreign workers should be eradicated.",2020-04-08 14:00:10

I have the same sentiments as you that we can improve their living conditions but I am against the fact that you are exaggerating their living conditions to seem like they live in horrible conditions which will misguide the public or those who are unaware. 

With regard to your second point, my opinion is that the current implementations are a necessary evil. The police are mainly there to enforce and make sure everyone stays put in the facility. With the sudden cluster outbreak and with covid at times having no symptoms, it's wise to contain the area and further prevent the spread. At least now we are able to identify suspects of covid, keeping them in place and dealing with them efficiently. It is a necessary evil because its the easiest way to contain the spread of the virus and prevent unlinked cases from increasing. 

With regard to not practicing social distancing, the workers are already in a facility where covid is apparent. The role of social distancing is to prevent further spread of the virus. In a way, the current measure is working because we are preventing the spread of covid to the outside world by containing the area. This move is similar to issuing a shn just that it's in a larger scale, affecting more people and enforced. With regards to multiple people being in the same room, the rooms are not as small as you think. The easiest way to describe would be that the size and layout of the room is similar to the bunks in tekong although they are smaller by a bit. Despite this there is also only a limited space in the dormitory, it's not feasible to move people around to maintain a super safe social distance. There's just no choice because in order to put social distancing in rooms into practice, the facility would have to move people out of rooms. Then the next issue would be where to move people without rooms? In my opinion the best solution now would be to have the facility management and the authorities to go through with workers why the place is under lock down and explain to them why the current measure is necessary. They should also gather all workers to address any concerns workers will have. This may quell any anger or resentment that occupants will have towards people in authority.",2020-04-08 11:54:10

Then you may be right for the first point but overall, it's meant to ensure the safety of other residents and not to treat them as ""prisoners"" living in a detention camp. Occupants working in different industries like construction or shipping may have access to tools that can pose a danger to other residents. And in a bid to prevent that, they might be checked when entering the facility.

Yes I have also met a worker who has stayed in Singapore for ten years. He's been here for so long because he's working to send all his daughters to medical school in India. He says that the pay back in his home country is not sufficient to do the same. My idea of temporary is that they are not staying here permanently. Workers also usually stay here for years because they are contracted by years and not months. After a period of time be it months or years they eventually leave. That is why I stated it as temporary even though they may have been residing in Singapore for quite some time.

Another point I want to make and I'm not siding on poor treatment of workers but workers have the option to choose their own housing facility albeit rare. Workers don't necessarily have to stay in dormitories, they have the option to rent HDB rooms but many choose not to because its more expensive. In addition, there are also different kinds of dormitories. Some dormitories are better than others but are also more expensive. Employers usually have a budget for housing and if workers instead choose a different housing option that is more expensive, they may be asked to top up the difference. Those that are reluctant have no choice but to stay in the dormitories that are assigned by their employers. This is the reason why I emphasise that workers should keep their quarters clean. If they do not wish to move to more sohphiscated dormitories that are more expensive, they should keep their current ones as clean as possible instead of letting it get filthy.",2020-04-08 12:12:14

The only things that I think government should directly intervene in are inelastic goods.

For Singapore, I refer to housing/medicine/food/water as inelastic.

For instance, if FW regulation leads to increase in manpower cost which leads to renovation becoming more expensive, then the end customers who want to use these FW for renovation will just have to pay more.

Best Case Scenario for the Opposition,"So now that nomination day has come and gone, I've decided to make my prediction for the opposition's best case scenario. This will be a realistic best case so you won't see things like PAP losing every seat because let's be honest, they won't based on the current matchups. Lee Hsien Loong is not losing to the Reform Party and neither is Tharman losing his race to Red Dot United. I'm not an expert political analyst so just take this as my two cents. If it happens, great. If it doesn't, then I guess I was wrong. Feel free to chime in and let me know what you think. 

I assume the situation will be closer to GE2011 than GE2015 when voters upset with how the PAP was running country limited them to a mere 60% of the popular vote and the loss of Aljunied GRC to the WP. In 2020 it will be them being upset with issues like the handling of Covid-19, maybe the Elected Presidency coupled with what looks like the best batch of Opposition politicians in decades to run for office. 

In this scenario I predict the Opposition will take 23 seats and it will be in the following SMCs and GRCs:

\-Hougang(WP)

\-Aljunied(WP)

\-Potong Pasir (SPP)

\-Bukit Batok(SDP)

\-Bukit Panjang(SDP)

\-West Coast (PSP)

\-East Coast(WP)

\-Jalan Besar(PVP)

Hougang SMC & Aljunied GRC

\-Together they consist of 6 seats and are currently held by WP. As Hougang is the WP stronghold I don't see it going to PAP just yet, even if Png Eng Huat has stepped down. 2015 was a shock in seeing the WP vote share drop below 60% but if we get more of 2011 it shouldn't drop any lower. 

\-If voters opt for more of the same, its likely they keep Hougang and even Aljunied as this is not a situation like 2015. WP has held Aljunied for 9 years now and voters will know their neighbourhood didn't collapse or they needed to repent like what PAP said. 

Potong Pasir SMC

\-It went to PAP by the narrowest of margins in 2011 but they retained it comfortably in 2015. Now Jose Raymond, the SPP chairman arrives to challenge Sitoh Yin.

\-I'm impressed by Jose's eloquence and he's one of those guys who doesn't show up every 5 years just to campaign and disappear. 

\-Based on social media posts and his own interview, he comes across as sincere and carries himself in a way that I think Chiam See Tong would approve of, having been inspired by the man himself. 

\-He's been a journalist and has a background in the Singapore Sports Council so he's got the CV and a sincerity in front of the camera. In a 2011 style election he'd win and be SPP's representative in Parliament.  

Bukit Batok SMC

\- Dr. Chee Soon Juan returns to take on Murali Pillai in a rematch of 2016's by-election where Murali with 62% of the vote.

\-Dr. Chee is a mainstay in politics although he was barred from running in any GE from 2001 to 2015 due him being bankrupt. In 2015 he attempted to contest Holland-Bukit Timah GRC but lost with only 33% of the vote.

\-Personally I think his party's ideas lean too much into welfare with little thought of how it will be paid for but in 2020 with the economy being bad, people might actually buy into his ideas and vote him in. 

Bukit Panjang SMC

\-Paul Tambyah might be from SDP but I actually think he's more capable than Dr. Chee and if anything he should be the face of SDP. 

\-His background in NCID and expertise on Covid-19  will be much needed in Parliament. Honestly one of the candidates I hope gets elected. He's in an SMC so there's no anchor minister to fend off and a favourable 2011 scenario would see him riding into Parliament. 

West Coast GRC

\-Tan Cheng Bock helms a team against PAP's own team led by S Iswaran. 

\-PSP goes into this fight with a lot of hype and Tan Cheng Bock seems to be really popular on the ground. It feels like he might just get what he wanted back in 2011 and 2017 and that is to be elected back into a government position. 

\-In a 2011 scenario I think he would probably take this 55-45 like WP did in Jurong. 

East Coast GRC

\-A Nicole Seah led WP team versus the PM-in waiting Heng Swee Keat, drafted in at the last minute possibly to counter Nicole Seah. 

\-I don't know if this is a brilliant move to plug a possible PAP loss without a guy like HSK anchoring the spot or PAP overestimating Heng's powers. 

\-Back in 2011 Nicole Seah was with NSP and scored an impressive 43% of the votes against the Marine Parade PAP team led by ESM Goh Chok Tong. Now she's in the WP blue and not surrounded by idiots, she can score an upset against HSK in a 2011 style situation who while a capable minister is no Goh Chok Tong. 

Jalan Besar GRC

\-The most surprising match up sees Lim Tean's PVP go up against Josephine Teo's PAP that is looking like a reenactment of the US Presidential Election of 2016. 

\-Personally I detest Lim Tean as a guy who seems to be overly critical of the PAP but up against Josephine Teo, the Minister of Manpower who really dropped the ball when it comes to the foreign worker dorm situation and one of the factors for the Circuit Breaker being implemented, I think he has a shot.

This will be a realistic best case so you won't see things like PAP losing every seat because let's be honest, they won't based on the current matchups. Lee Hsien Loong is not losing to the Reform Party and neither is Tharman losing his race to Red Dot United. I'm not an expert political analyst so just take this as my two cents. If it happens, great. If it doesn't, then I guess I was wrong. Feel free to chime in and let me know what you think. 

I assume the situation will be closer to GE2011 than GE2015 when voters upset with how the PAP was running country limited them to a mere 60% of the popular vote and the loss of Aljunied GRC to the WP. In 2020 it will be them being upset with issues like the handling of Covid-19, maybe the Elected Presidency coupled with what looks like the best batch of Opposition politicians in decades to run for office. 

In this scenario I predict the Opposition will take 23 seats and it will be in the following SMCs and GRCs:

\-Hougang(WP)

\-Aljunied(WP)

\-Potong Pasir (SPP)

\-Bukit Batok(SDP)

\-Bukit Panjang(SDP)

\-West Coast (PSP)

\-East Coast(WP)

\-Jalan Besar(PVP)

&#x200B;

Hougang SMC & Aljunied GRC

\-Together they consist of 6 seats and are currently held by WP. As Hougang is the WP stronghold I don't see it going to PAP just yet, even if Png Eng Huat has stepped down. 2015 was a shock in seeing the WP vote share drop below 60% but if we get more of 2011 it shouldn't drop any lower. 

\-If voters opt for more of the same, its likely they keep Hougang and even Aljunied as this is not a situation like 2015. WP has held Aljunied for 9 years now and voters will know their neighbourhood didn't collapse or they needed to repent like what PAP said. 

Potong Pasir SMC

\-It went to PAP by the narrowest of margins in 2011 but they retained it comfortably in 2015. Now Jose Raymond, the SPP chairman arrives to challenge Sitoh Yin.

\-I'm impressed by Jose's eloquence and he's one of those guys who doesn't show up every 5 years just to campaign and disappear. 

\-Based on social media posts and his own interview, he comes across as sincere and carries himself in a way that I think Chiam See Tong would approve of, having been inspired by the man himself. 

\-He's been a journalist and has a background in the Singapore Sports Council so he's got the CV and a sincerity in front of the camera. In a 2011 style election he'd win and be SPP's representative in Parliament.  

Bukit Batok SMC

\- Dr. Chee Soon Juan returns to take on Murali Pillai in a rematch of 2016's by-election where Murali with 62% of the vote.

\-Dr. Chee is a mainstay in politics although he was barred from running in any GE from 2001 to 2015 due him being bankrupt. In 2015 he attempted to contest Holland-Bukit Timah GRC but lost with only 33% of the vote.

\-Personally I think his party's ideas lean too much into welfare with little thought of how it will be paid for but in 2020 with the economy being bad, people might actually buy into his ideas and vote him in. 

Bukit Panjang SMC

\-Paul Tambyah might be from SDP but I actually think he's more capable than Dr. Chee and if anything he should be the face of SDP. 

\-His background in NCID and expertise on Covid-19  will be much needed in Parliament. Honestly one of the candidates I hope gets elected. He's in an SMC so there's no anchor minister to fend off and a favourable 2011 scenario would see him riding into Parliament. 

West Coast GRC

\-Tan Cheng Bock helms a team against PAP's own team led by S Iswaran. 

\-PSP goes into this fight with a lot of hype and Tan Cheng Bock seems to be really popular on the ground. It feels like he might just get what he wanted back in 2011 and 2017 and that is to be elected back into a government position. 

\-In a 2011 scenario I think he would probably take this 55-45 like WP did in Jurong. 

East Coast GRC

\-A Nicole Seah led WP team versus the PM-in waiting Heng Swee Keat, drafted in at the last minute possibly to counter Nicole Seah. 

\-I don't know if this is a brilliant move to plug a possible PAP loss without a guy like HSK anchoring the spot or PAP overestimating Heng's powers. 

\-Back in 2011 Nicole Seah was with NSP and scored an impressive 43% of the votes against the Marine Parade PAP team led by ESM Goh Chok Tong. Now she's in the WP blue and not surrounded by idiots, she can score an upset against HSK in a 2011 style situation who while a capable minister is no Goh Chok Tong. 

Jalan Besar GRC

\-The most surprising match up sees Lim Tean's PVP go up against Josephine Teo's PAP that is looking like a reenactment of the US Presidential Election of 2016. 

\-Personally I detest Lim Tean as a guy who seems to be overly critical of the PAP but up against Josephine Teo, the Minister of Manpower who really dropped the ball when it comes to the foreign worker dorm situation and one of the factors for the Circuit Breaker being implemented, I think he has a shot. 

\-Throw in an election with a scenario closer to 2011 and you'll get a very ugly upset where there are no real winners.

&#x200B;

Do let me know what you guys think. Would the opposition's realistic best case be 23 or is it more or less?","My best guess is: 

WP holds the line with Hougang SMC and Aljunied GRC. Nicole is great on camera, and a good campaigner, but don't think they'll win against DPM HSK. Probably NCMP the WP team there. They might get Sengkang GRC, it's made up from SMCs that were quite prone to WP in the last election, hence the ~~Tom and **Gerry** game~~ boundary changed due solely changes in electors in the area^ya^right^my^arse. Jamus is a damn DPS Tank, and He Tingru has some name recognition. 

CSJ may flip BB, Murali seems to be scared already, and throws out reverse allegation against the SDP with the resident asskisser Calvin joining in. Paul may win BJ SMC, good name recognition, great background in this Covid pandemic especially. 

PSP, strongest showing will probably be under TCB at WC GRC, but unlikely to win against Iswaran and gang. Probably NCMP slots. 

Lim Tean, forget it. He will garner probably 30-35% of votes. But Denise is the tank in Jln Besar, not small space. However, if smallspace Teo sticks her foot in her mouth, PV might gain up to 40 ish % of votes, and get NCMP slots, maybe.",2020-06-30 23:07:42

Best Case Scenario for the Opposition,"So now that nomination day has come and gone, I've decided to make my prediction for the opposition's best case scenario. This will be a realistic best case so you won't see things like PAP losing every seat because let's be honest, they won't based on the current matchups. Lee Hsien Loong is not losing to the Reform Party and neither is Tharman losing his race to Red Dot United. I'm not an expert political analyst so just take this as my two cents. If it happens, great. If it doesn't, then I guess I was wrong. Feel free to chime in and let me know what you think. 

I assume the situation will be closer to GE2011 than GE2015 when voters upset with how the PAP was running country limited them to a mere 60% of the popular vote and the loss of Aljunied GRC to the WP. In 2020 it will be them being upset with issues like the handling of Covid-19, maybe the Elected Presidency coupled with what looks like the best batch of Opposition politicians in decades to run for office. 

In this scenario I predict the Opposition will take 23 seats and it will be in the following SMCs and GRCs:

\-Hougang(WP)

\-Aljunied(WP)

\-Potong Pasir (SPP)

\-Bukit Batok(SDP)

\-Bukit Panjang(SDP)

\-West Coast (PSP)

\-East Coast(WP)

Hougang SMC & Aljunied GRC

\-Together they consist of 6 seats and are currently held by WP. As Hougang is the WP stronghold I don't see it going to PAP just yet, even if Png Eng Huat has stepped down. 2015 was a shock in seeing the WP vote share drop below 60% but if we get more of 2011 it shouldn't drop any lower. 

\-If voters opt for more of the same, its likely they keep Hougang and even Aljunied as this is not a situation like 2015. WP has held Aljunied for 9 years now and voters will know their neighbourhood didn't collapse or they needed to repent like what PAP said. 

Potong Pasir SMC

\-It went to PAP by the narrowest of margins in 2011 but they retained it comfortably in 2015. Now Jose Raymond, the SPP chairman arrives to challenge Sitoh Yin.

\-I'm impressed by Jose's eloquence and he's one of those guys who doesn't show up every 5 years just to campaign and disappear. 

\-Based on social media posts and his own interview, he comes across as sincere and carries himself in a way that I think Chiam See Tong would approve of, having been inspired by the man himself. 

\-He's been a journalist and has a background in the Singapore Sports Council so he's got the CV and a sincerity in front of the camera. In a 2011 style election he'd win and be SPP's representative in Parliament.  

Bukit Batok SMC

\- Dr. Chee Soon Juan returns to take on Murali Pillai in a rematch of 2016's by-election where Murali with 62% of the vote.

\-Dr. Chee is a mainstay in politics although he was barred from running in any GE from 2001 to 2015 due him being bankrupt. In 2015 he attempted to contest Holland-Bukit Timah GRC but lost with only 33% of the vote.

\-Personally I think his party's ideas lean too much into welfare with little thought of how it will be paid for but in 2020 with the economy being bad, people might actually buy into his ideas and vote him in. 

Bukit Panjang SMC

\-Paul Tambyah might be from SDP but I actually think he's more capable than Dr. Chee and if anything he should be the face of SDP. 

\-His background in NCID and expertise on Covid-19  will be much needed in Parliament. Honestly one of the candidates I hope gets elected. He's in an SMC so there's no anchor minister to fend off and a favourable 2011 scenario would see him riding into Parliament. 

West Coast GRC

\-Tan Cheng Bock helms a team against PAP's own team led by S Iswaran. 

\-PSP goes into this fight with a lot of hype and Tan Cheng Bock seems to be really popular on the ground. It feels like he might just get what he wanted back in 2011 and 2017 and that is to be elected back into a government position. 

\-In a 2011 scenario I think he would probably take this 55-45 like WP did in Jurong. 

East Coast GRC

\-A Nicole Seah led WP team versus the PM-in waiting Heng Swee Keat, drafted in at the last minute possibly to counter Nicole Seah. 

\-I don't know if this is a brilliant move to plug a possible PAP loss without a guy like HSK anchoring the spot or PAP overestimating Heng's powers. 

\-Back in 2011 Nicole Seah was with NSP and scored an impressive 43% of the votes against the Marine Parade PAP team led by ESM Goh Chok Tong. Now she's in the WP blue and not surrounded by idiots, she can score an upset against HSK in a 2011 style situation who while a capable minister is no Goh Chok Tong. 

Jalan Besar GRC

\-The most surprising match up sees Lim Tean's PVP go up against Josephine Teo's PAP that is looking like a reenactment of the US Presidential Election of 2016. 

\-Personally I detest Lim Tean as a guy who seems to be overly critical of the PAP but up against Josephine Teo, the Minister of Manpower who really dropped the ball when it comes to the foreign worker dorm situation and one of the factors for the Circuit Breaker being implemented, I think he has a shot. 

\-Throw in an election with a scenario closer to 2011 and you'll get a very ugly upset where there are no real winners.

Do let me know what you guys think. Would the opposition's realistic best case be 23 or is it more or less?","Potong Pasir SMC resident since late 2018
Previously Bukit Batok SMC resident, voted twice (GE then By Election - Murali v Chee)

I’m always cautious about assuming what the sentiment on the ground is. Reddit is a bubble and so are our take on things. But I thought I’d chip in with my own sentiments. 

Potong Pasir is a tough call. It’s a “low risk” SMC with rich political history and it could go either way. On one hand, under Sitoh’s watch, there are now covered walkways from the MRT to all blocks, the canal was spruced up and looks great, home improvement, etc. The area looks modern with very little sense of Chiam left. The older residents look back fondly on their Chiam days but appreciate new, better accessibility. Younger families like mine have moved into the estate, plus there are new residential developments. We are in between. Losing Sitoh frankly isn’t a great loss to parliament so trying out Jose is a risk worth taking since he isn’t a bad candidate. It may be a 50/50, 60/40, but even if it’s 70/30, it’ll be more that it was a tough choice rather than people felt much more strongly for one over the other. TBH, as an election official AND resident, I am quite excited to see how this plays out. 

Chee has mellowed since he last contested Bukit Batok where Murali won convincingly, even though in a By Election people have a chance to be a bit more daring in their vote if the party of their choice is already comfortably in government. Whatever is circulating online, my personal take on Murali was that he is a sincere MP. And he won in 2016 because the ground knows him. People who vote for Murali will vote for their MP. People who vote for Chee may vote with more macro objectives.",2020-06-30 23:37:25

Would the opposition's realistic best case be 23 or is it more or less?","Most people are not upset or minded about the handling of COVID-19 or the president issues. Most people will be happy with SIRS and JSS. They also feel that only PAP can help to guide them out of this crisis.

My prediction is that the best case scenario means that WP means Aljunied and Hougang. That's it.

Forget about East Coast, East Coast has been redrawn such that more pro-PAP districts are included.

Worst case for opposition is that they win Hougang only. This is possible since WP got only 50.96% of the votes. Further, LTK is gone and a lot of WP support was for him. Most Chinese boomer voters cannot relate to Pritam. And the current Aljunied team has 3 non-chinese, and (right or wrong) some boomer voters will not accept this. Hence, PAP may with with 5-10% margin.

All the other SMCs and GRCs have no chance at all.

Do let me know what you guys think. Would the opposition's realistic best case be 23 or is it more or less?","Best case scenario for the opposition in my view will be 19 seats for the opposition.

Hougang(WP) Ajiunied(WP) SengKang (WP)  East Coast (WP) West coast (PSP) Bukit Batok (SDP) 19 seats in total with no ncmp and 1 PM chan. With close fights in Bukit Panjang and Marymount.

However the most realistic scenario i can guess is WP winning Hougang, Ajunied, Sengkang as well as possibly East coast with a good chance (14 seats) or with NCMPs coming from SDP(Bukit Batok) or PSP(West Coast) and WP(East coast) assuming WP does not win East Coast (10+2 NCMP seats)

PAP will win around 55% of the vote to 65% max in this election but theres no way in hell they lose to PV in Jalan Besar even if it's Jo teo. PV is way too bad of a opposition to even beat PAP.",2020-07-01 00:10:58

Do let me know what you guys think. Would the opposition's realistic best case be 23 or is it more or less?","My personal thoughts align to a large degree with yours.

I think WP will get Aljunied and Hougang (possibly with a slightly more comfortable margin than in 2015).

SMC with highest flip chance for me is Bukit Panjang. The retirement of the incumbent might see just enough votes going over to the oppo.

Bukit Batok, I still don't see it happening. CSJ might actually break 40% this time though.

As for GRCs, I think East Coast GRC will be closer to 2011 elections than 2015 (50+% for the PAP) with a good oppo fielding in the GRC. People overestimate HSK's blunder imo, it will have an effect but will be buried under other issues and be forgotten/rationalized away to some degree by the time polling day comes about. Nevertheless, even a weak 50% mandate for the PM-designate will be damaging to the PAP.

Finally, for West Coast, I think a below 5% margin would already be a very good showing for a new party like the PSP. IMO other than Dr Tan, PSP candidates still have too low of a public recognition outside of Reddit. Their best bet would be to strive for the best result and work the ground really hard over the next 4-5 years.

\-I don't know if this is a brilliant move to plug a possible PAP loss without a guy like HSK anchoring the spot or PAP overestimating Heng's powers. 

\-Back in 2011 Nicole Seah was with NSP and scored an impressive 43% of the votes against the Marine Parade PAP team led by ESM Goh Chok Tong. Now she's in the WP blue and not surrounded by idiots, she can score an upset against HSK in a 2011 style situation who while a capable minister is no Goh Chok Tong. 

Jalan Besar GRC

\-The most surprising match up sees Lim Tean's PVP go up against Josephine Teo's PAP that is looking like a reenactment of the US Presidential Election of 2016. 

\-Personally I detest Lim Tean as a guy who seems to be overly critical of the PAP but up against Josephine Teo, the Minister of Manpower who really dropped the ball when it comes to the foreign worker dorm situation and one of the factors for the Circuit Breaker being implemented, I think he has a shot. 

\-Throw in an election with a scenario closer to 2011 and you'll get a very ugly upset where there are no real winners.

Do let me know what you guys think. Would the opposition's realistic best case be 23 or is it more or less?","I agree, hmm I would include Bukit Batok SMC (SDP) as well though.",2020-06-30 23:09:55
Best Case Scenario for the Opposition,"So now that nomination day has come and gone, I've decided to make my prediction for the opposition's best case scenario. This will be a realistic best case so you won't see things like PAP losing every seat because let's be honest, they won't based on the current matchups. Lee Hsien Loong is not losing to the Reform Party and neither is Tharman losing his race to Red Dot United. I'm not an expert political analyst so just take this as my two cents. If it happens, great. If it doesn't, then I guess I was wrong. Feel free to chime in and let me know what you think. 

I assume the situation will be closer to GE2011 than GE2015 when voters upset with how the PAP was running country limited them to a mere 60% of the popular vote and the loss of Aljunied GRC to the WP. In 2020 it will be them being upset with issues like the handling of Covid-19, maybe the Elected Presidency coupled with what looks like the best batch of Opposition politicians in decades to run for office. 

In this scenario I predict the Opposition will take 23 seats and it will be in the following SMCs and GRCs:

\-Hougang(WP)

\-Aljunied(WP)

\-Potong Pasir (SPP)

\-Bukit Batok(SDP)

\-Bukit Panjang(SDP)

\-West Coast (PSP)

\-East Coast(WP)

\-Jalan Besar(PVP)

&#x200B;

Hougang SMC & Aljunied GRC

\-Together they consist of 6 seats and are currently held by WP. As Hougang is the WP stronghold I don't see it going to PAP just yet, even if Png Eng Huat has stepped down. 2015 was a shock in seeing the WP vote share drop below 60% but if we get more of 2011 it shouldn't drop any lower. 

\-If voters opt for more of the same, its likely they keep Hougang and even Aljunied as this is not a situation like 2015. WP has held Aljunied for 9 years now and voters will know their neighbourhood didn't collapse or they needed to repent like what PAP said. 

Potong Pasir SMC

\-It went to PAP by the narrowest of margins in 2011 but they retained it comfortably in 2015. Now Jose Raymond, the SPP chairman arrives to challenge Sitoh Yin.

\-I'm impressed by Jose's eloquence and he's one of those guys who doesn't show up every 5 years just to campaign and disappear. 

\-Based on social media posts and his own interview, he comes across as sincere and carries himself in a way that I think Chiam See Tong would approve of, having been inspired by the man himself. 

\-He's been a journalist and has a background in the Singapore Sports Council so he's got the CV and a sincerity in front of the camera. In a 2011 style election he'd win and be SPP's representative in Parliament.  

Bukit Batok SMC

\- Dr. Chee Soon Juan returns to take on Murali Pillai in a rematch of 2016's by-election where Murali with 62% of the vote.

\-Dr. Chee is a mainstay in politics although he was barred from running in any GE from 2001 to 2015 due him being bankrupt. In 2015 he attempted to contest Holland-Bukit Timah GRC but lost with only 33% of the vote.

\-Personally I think his party's ideas lean too much into welfare with little thought of how it will be paid for but in 2020 with the economy being bad, people might actually buy into his ideas and vote him in. 

Bukit Panjang SMC

\-Paul Tambyah might be from SDP but I actually think he's more capable than Dr. Chee and if anything he should be the face of SDP. 

\-His background in NCID and expertise on Covid-19  will be much needed in Parliament. Honestly one of the candidates I hope gets elected. He's in an SMC so there's no anchor minister to fend off and a favourable 2011 scenario would see him riding into Parliament. 

West Coast GRC

\-Tan Cheng Bock helms a team against PAP's own team led by S Iswaran. 

\-PSP goes into this fight with a lot of hype and Tan Cheng Bock seems to be really popular on the ground. It feels like he might just get what he wanted back in 2011 and 2017 and that is to be elected back into a government position. 

\-In a 2011 scenario I think he would probably take this 55-45 like WP did in Jurong.

By the way the population of sg is not what you see on the streets. The true voting pppulation which you can see during the actual voting process, the population is ALoT older than the average look on the streets. The retirement homes and old flats hide a lot of the old folks who normally don’t appear outside. These get trotted out or ownself come out.

\-Personally I detest Lim Tean as a guy who seems to be overly critical of the PAP but up against Josephine Teo, the Minister of Manpower who really dropped the ball when it comes to the foreign worker dorm situation and one of the factors for the Circuit Breaker being implemented, I think he has a shot. 

\-Throw in an election with a scenario closer to 2011 and you'll get a very ugly upset where there are no real winners.

&#x200B;

Do let me know what you guys think. Would the opposition's realistic best case be 23 or is it more or less?","I think the smaller opposition parties are going to struggle but rallies have always been deceptive particularly when it comes to Opposition parties because they tend to attract audiences from outside of their SMC/GRC. So not having any physical rallies is not really going to impact it on that front. 

I'm impressed with WP's social media team, really on point so far but would need to see how PSP and SDP get their points across. So far it looks like all parties including PAP still do their walkabouts on the ground to get support so I will be keen to see how a lack of physical rally will impact things.   


As for PAP support,I'd say about 30-40% of are made up hardcore voters who won't budge from PAP or dare not try the opposition. Another 30-40% are swing voters who would vote for either party but likely vote for PAP if they think the opposition candidate is complete rubbish. The remainder make up the base of the opposition.",2020-06-30 22:56:45
Best Case Scenario for the Opposition,"So now that nomination day has come and gone, I've decided to make my prediction for the opposition's best case scenario. This will be a realistic best case so you won't see things like PAP losing every seat because let's be honest, they won't based on the current matchups. Lee Hsien Loong is not losing to the Reform Party and neither is Tharman losing his race to Red Dot United. I'm not an expert political analyst so just take this as my two cents. If it happens, great. If it doesn't, then I guess I was wrong. Feel free to chime in and let me know what you think. 

I assume the situation will be closer to GE2011 than GE2015 when voters upset with how the PAP was running country limited them to a mere 60% of the popular vote and the loss of Aljunied GRC to the WP. In 2020 it will be them being upset with issues like the handling of Covid-19, maybe the Elected Presidency coupled with what looks like the best batch of Opposition politicians in decades to run for office. 

In this scenario I predict the Opposition will take 23 seats and it will be in the following SMCs and GRCs:

\-Hougang(WP)

\-Aljunied(WP)

\-Potong Pasir (SPP)

\-Bukit Batok(SDP)

\-Bukit Panjang(SDP)

\-West Coast (PSP)

\-East Coast(WP)

\-Jalan Besar(PVP)

Hougang SMC & Aljunied GRC

\-Together they consist of 6 seats and are currently held by WP. As Hougang is the WP stronghold I don't see it going to PAP just yet, even if Png Eng Huat has stepped down. 2015 was a shock in seeing the WP vote share drop below 60% but if we get more of 2011 it shouldn't drop any lower. 

\-If voters opt for more of the same, its likely they keep Hougang and even Aljunied as this is not a situation like 2015. WP has held Aljunied for 9 years now and voters will know their neighbourhood didn't collapse or they needed to repent like what PAP said. 

Potong Pasir SMC

\-It went to PAP by the narrowest of margins in 2011 but they retained it comfortably in 2015. Now Jose Raymond, the SPP chairman arrives to challenge Sitoh Yin.

\-I'm impressed by Jose's eloquence and he's one of those guys who doesn't show up every 5 years just to campaign and disappear. 

\-Based on social media posts and his own interview, he comes across as sincere and carries himself in a way that I think Chiam See Tong would approve of, having been inspired by the man himself. 

\-He's been a journalist and has a background in the Singapore Sports Council so he's got the CV and a sincerity in front of the camera. In a 2011 style election he'd win and be SPP's representative in Parliament.  

Bukit Batok SMC

\- Dr. Chee Soon Juan returns to take on Murali Pillai in a rematch of 2016's by-election where Murali with 62% of the vote.

\-Dr. Chee is a mainstay in politics although he was barred from running in any GE from 2001 to 2015 due him being bankrupt. In 2015 he attempted to contest Holland-Bukit Timah GRC but lost with only 33% of the vote.

\-Personally I think his party's ideas lean too much into welfare with little thought of how it will be paid for but in 2020 with the economy being bad, people might actually buy into his ideas and vote him in. 

Bukit Panjang SMC

\-Paul Tambyah might be from SDP but I actually think he's more capable than Dr. Chee and if anything he should be the face of SDP. 

\-His background in NCID and expertise on Covid-19  will be much needed in Parliament. Honestly one of the candidates I hope gets elected. He's in an SMC so there's no anchor minister to fend off and a favourable 2011 scenario would see him riding into Parliament. 

West Coast GRC

\-Tan Cheng Bock helms a team against PAP's own team led by S Iswaran. 

\-PSP goes into this fight with a lot of hype and Tan Cheng Bock seems to be really popular on the ground. It feels like he might just get what he wanted back in 2011 and 2017 and that is to be elected back into a government position. 

\-In a 2011 scenario I think he would probably take this 55-45 like WP did in Jurong. 

East Coast GRC

\-A Nicole Seah led WP team versus the PM-in waiting Heng Swee Keat, drafted in at the last minute possibly to counter Nicole Seah. 

\-I don't know if this is a brilliant move to plug a possible PAP loss without a guy like HSK anchoring the spot or PAP overestimating Heng's powers. 

\-Back in 2011 Nicole Seah was with NSP and scored an impressive 43% of the votes against the Marine Parade PAP team led by ESM Goh Chok Tong. Now she's in the WP blue and not surrounded by idiots, she can score an upset against HSK in a 2011 style situation who while a capable minister is no Goh Chok Tong.

However, I do appreciate that for r/sg we can discuss a range of topics that wouldn't normally be discussed on other social media platforms.",2020-06-30 23:42:58
Best Case Scenario for the Opposition,"So now that nomination day has come and gone, I've decided to make my prediction for the opposition's best case scenario. This will be a realistic best case so you won't see things like PAP losing every seat because let's be honest, they won't based on the current matchups. Lee Hsien Loong is not losing to the Reform Party and neither is Tharman losing his race to Red Dot United. I'm not an expert political analyst so just take this as my two cents. If it happens, great. If it doesn't, then I guess I was wrong. Feel free to chime in and let me know what you think. 

I assume the situation will be closer to GE2011 than GE2015 when voters upset with how the PAP was running country limited them to a mere 60% of the popular vote and the loss of Aljunied GRC to the WP. In 2020 it will be them being upset with issues like the handling of Covid-19, maybe the Elected Presidency coupled with what looks like the best batch of Opposition politicians in decades to run for office. 

In this scenario I predict the Opposition will take 23 seats and it will be in the following SMCs and GRCs:

\-Hougang(WP)

\-Aljunied(WP)

\-Potong Pasir (SPP)

\-Bukit Batok(SDP)

\-Bukit Panjang(SDP)

\-West Coast (PSP)

\-East Coast(WP)

\-Jalan Besar(PVP)

&#x200B;

Hougang SMC & Aljunied GRC

\-Together they consist of 6 seats and are currently held by WP. As Hougang is the WP stronghold I don't see it going to PAP just yet, even if Png Eng Huat has stepped down. 2015 was a shock in seeing the WP vote share drop below 60% but if we get more of 2011 it shouldn't drop any lower. 

\-If voters opt for more of the same, its likely they keep Hougang and even Aljunied as this is not a situation like 2015. WP has held Aljunied for 9 years now and voters will know their neighbourhood didn't collapse or they needed to repent like what PAP said. 

Potong Pasir SMC

\-It went to PAP by the narrowest of margins in 2011 but they retained it comfortably in 2015. Now Jose Raymond, the SPP chairman arrives to challenge Sitoh Yin.

\-I'm impressed by Jose's eloquence and he's one of those guys who doesn't show up every 5 years just to campaign and disappear. 

\-Based on social media posts and his own interview, he comes across as sincere and carries himself in a way that I think Chiam See Tong would approve of, having been inspired by the man himself. 

\-He's been a journalist and has a background in the Singapore Sports Council so he's got the CV and a sincerity in front of the camera. In a 2011 style election he'd win and be SPP's representative in Parliament.  

Bukit Batok SMC

\- Dr. Chee Soon Juan returns to take on Murali Pillai in a rematch of 2016's by-election where Murali with 62% of the vote.

\-Dr. Chee is a mainstay in politics although he was barred from running in any GE from 2001 to 2015 due him being bankrupt. In 2015 he attempted to contest Holland-Bukit Timah GRC but lost with only 33% of the vote.

\-Personally I think his party's ideas lean too much into welfare with little thought of how it will be paid for but in 2020 with the economy being bad, people might actually buy into his ideas and vote him in. 

Bukit Panjang SMC

\-Paul Tambyah might be from SDP but I actually think he's more capable than Dr. Chee and if anything he should be the face of SDP. 

\-His background in NCID and expertise on Covid-19  will be much needed in Parliament. Honestly one of the candidates I hope gets elected. He's in an SMC so there's no anchor minister to fend off and a favourable 2011 scenario would see him riding into Parliament. 

West Coast GRC

\-Tan Cheng Bock helms a team against PAP's own team led by S Iswaran. 

\-PSP goes into this fight with a lot of hype and Tan Cheng Bock seems to be really popular on the ground. It feels like he might just get what he wanted back in 2011 and 2017 and that is to be elected back into a government position. 

\-In a 2011 scenario I think he would probably take this 55-45 like WP did in Jurong. 

East Coast GRC

\-A Nicole Seah led WP team versus the PM-in waiting Heng Swee Keat, drafted in at the last minute possibly to counter Nicole Seah. 

\-I don't know if this is a brilliant move to plug a possible PAP loss without a guy like HSK anchoring the spot or PAP overestimating Heng's powers. 

\-Back in 2011 Nicole Seah was with NSP and scored an impressive 43% of the votes against the Marine Parade PAP team led by ESM Goh Chok Tong. Now she's in the WP blue and not surrounded by idiots, she can score an upset against HSK in a 2011 style situation who while a capable minister is no Goh Chok Tong. 

Jalan Besar GRC

\-The most surprising match up sees Lim Tean's PVP go up against Josephine Teo's PAP that is looking like a reenactment of the US Presidential Election of 2016. 

\-Personally I detest Lim Tean as a guy who seems to be overly critical of the PAP but up against Josephine Teo, the Minister of Manpower who really dropped the ball when it comes to the foreign worker dorm situation and one of the factors for the Circuit Breaker being implemented, I think he has a shot. 

\-Throw in an election with a scenario closer to 2011 and you'll get a very ugly upset where there are no real winners.

Do let me know what you guys think. Would the opposition's realistic best case be 23 or is it more or less?",I disagree with the assessment of Aljunied. LTK isn't completely out of the picture but will simply not be running this round. As for the Chinese Vs non-Chinese issue WP would not have made the choice of even passing the leadership position to Pritam Singh if they didn't think voters would accept a non-Chinese leader. They've been working the ground in Aljunied for at least a decade so I trust their assessment of the situation.,2020-07-01 00:30:56

I assume the situation will be closer to GE2011 than GE2015 when voters upset with how the PAP was running country limited them to a mere 60% of the popular vote and the loss of Aljunied GRC to the WP. In 2020 it will be them being upset with issues like the handling of Covid-19, maybe the Elected Presidency coupled with what looks like the best batch of Opposition politicians in decades to run for office. 

In this scenario I predict the Opposition will take 23 seats and it will be in the following SMCs and GRCs:

\-Hougang(WP)

\-Aljunied(WP)

\-Potong Pasir (SPP)

\-Bukit Batok(SDP)

\-Bukit Panjang(SDP)

\-West Coast (PSP)

\-East Coast(WP)

\-Jalan Besar(PVP)

&#x200B;

Hougang SMC & Aljunied GRC

\-Together they consist of 6 seats and are currently held by WP. As Hougang is the WP stronghold I don't see it going to PAP just yet, even if Png Eng Huat has stepped down. 2015 was a shock in seeing the WP vote share drop below 60% but if we get more of 2011 it shouldn't drop any lower. 

\-If voters opt for more of the same, its likely they keep Hougang and even Aljunied as this is not a situation like 2015. WP has held Aljunied for 9 years now and voters will know their neighbourhood didn't collapse or they needed to repent like what PAP said. 

Potong Pasir SMC

\-It went to PAP by the narrowest of margins in 2011 but they retained it comfortably in 2015. Now Jose Raymond, the SPP chairman arrives to challenge Sitoh Yin.

\-I'm impressed by Jose's eloquence and he's one of those guys who doesn't show up every 5 years just to campaign and disappear. 

\-Based on social media posts and his own interview, he comes across as sincere and carries himself in a way that I think Chiam See Tong would approve of, having been inspired by the man himself. 

\-He's been a journalist and has a background in the Singapore Sports Council so he's got the CV and a sincerity in front of the camera. In a 2011 style election he'd win and be SPP's representative in Parliament.  

Bukit Batok SMC

\- Dr. Chee Soon Juan returns to take on Murali Pillai in a rematch of 2016's by-election where Murali with 62% of the vote.

\-Dr. Chee is a mainstay in politics although he was barred from running in any GE from 2001 to 2015 due him being bankrupt. In 2015 he attempted to contest Holland-Bukit Timah GRC but lost with only 33% of the vote.

\-Personally I think his party's ideas lean too much into welfare with little thought of how it will be paid for but in 2020 with the economy being bad, people might actually buy into his ideas and vote him in. 

Bukit Panjang SMC

\-Paul Tambyah might be from SDP but I actually think he's more capable than Dr. Chee and if anything he should be the face of SDP. 

\-His background in NCID and expertise on Covid-19  will be much needed in Parliament. Honestly one of the candidates I hope gets elected. He's in an SMC so there's no anchor minister to fend off and a favourable 2011 scenario would see him riding into Parliament. 

West Coast GRC

\-Tan Cheng Bock helms a team against PAP's own team led by S Iswaran. 

\-PSP goes into this fight with a lot of hype and Tan Cheng Bock seems to be really popular on the ground. It feels like he might just get what he wanted back in 2011 and 2017 and that is to be elected back into a government position. 

\-In a 2011 scenario I think he would probably take this 55-45 like WP did in Jurong. 

East Coast GRC

\-A Nicole Seah led WP team versus the PM-in waiting Heng Swee Keat, drafted in at the last minute possibly to counter Nicole Seah. 

\-I don't know if this is a brilliant move to plug a possible PAP loss without a guy like HSK anchoring the spot or PAP overestimating Heng's powers. 

\-Back in 2011 Nicole Seah was with NSP and scored an impressive 43% of the votes against the Marine Parade PAP team led by ESM Goh Chok Tong. Now she's in the WP blue and not surrounded by idiots, she can score an upset against HSK in a 2011 style situation who while a capable minister is no Goh Chok Tong. 

Jalan Besar GRC

\-The most surprising match up sees Lim Tean's PVP go up against Josephine Teo's PAP that is looking like a reenactment of the US Presidential Election of 2016. 

\-Personally I detest Lim Tean as a guy who seems to be overly critical of the PAP but up against Josephine Teo, the Minister of Manpower who really dropped the ball when it comes to the foreign worker dorm situation and one of the factors for the Circuit Breaker being implemented, I think he has a shot. 

\-Throw in an election with a scenario closer to 2011 and you'll get a very ugly upset where there are no real winners.

&#x200B;

Do let me know what you guys think. Would the opposition's realistic best case be 23 or is it more or less?","I've seen Jamus' video. Quite nicely done (on IG) about his backstory, his volunteering. Yeah, they're green, but I don't think they can afford to throw Pritam or Sylvia to Sengkang GRC as yet, they were probably hoping that the SMCs stayed as SMCs, but they're doing their best with the new GRC formation. 

Jose Raymond, I dont have an opinion on, but I would like Paul Tambyah in parliament. Impressed with him since 2015, but I understand why he wasn't on the Task Force for Covid, or anyway near a microphone and camera (but was still interviewed anyway).",2020-06-30 23:21:16

In 2015, the margin was 68-32 (though granted a very strong PAP election). In 2011, Moulmein-Kallang GRC (which includes most of the current Jalan Besar), it was 59-41 even with an unpopular anchor minister Lui Tuck Yew. 

In any case I also think we may be overestimating the JoTeo effect. Unpopular opinion, but I honestly don’t think foreign workers would rank as even the top few issues for a lot of voters. This contrasts with Lui Tuck Yew’s Transport Ministry in 2011, which was the target of massive outrage due to the train breakdowns which materially affected voters’ lives. So coupled with the fact that Lim Tean himself is a hit-or-miss firebrand and his party isn’t that well-known, I would say perhaps high 30s or low 40s would be a more reasonable outcome.",2020-06-30 23:32:04

Lee Hsien Loong is not losing to the Reform Party and neither is Tharman losing his race to Red Dot United. I'm not an expert political analyst so just take this as my two cents. If it happens, great. If it doesn't, then I guess I was wrong. Feel free to chime in and let me know what you think. 

I assume the situation will be closer to GE2011 than GE2015 when voters upset with how the PAP was running country limited them to a mere 60% of the popular vote and the loss of Aljunied GRC to the WP. In 2020 it will be them being upset with issues like the handling of Covid-19, maybe the Elected Presidency coupled with what looks like the best batch of Opposition politicians in decades to run for office. 

In this scenario I predict the Opposition will take 23 seats and it will be in the following SMCs and GRCs:

\-Hougang(WP)

\-Aljunied(WP)

\-Potong Pasir (SPP)

\-Bukit Batok(SDP)

\-Bukit Panjang(SDP)

\-West Coast (PSP)

\-East Coast(WP)

\-Jalan Besar(PVP)

&#x200B;

Hougang SMC & Aljunied GRC

\-Together they consist of 6 seats and are currently held by WP. As Hougang is the WP stronghold I don't see it going to PAP just yet, even if Png Eng Huat has stepped down. 2015 was a shock in seeing the WP vote share drop below 60% but if we get more of 2011 it shouldn't drop any lower. 

\-If voters opt for more of the same, its likely they keep Hougang and even Aljunied as this is not a situation like 2015. WP has held Aljunied for 9 years now and voters will know their neighbourhood didn't collapse or they needed to repent like what PAP said. 

Potong Pasir SMC

\-It went to PAP by the narrowest of margins in 2011 but they retained it comfortably in 2015. Now Jose Raymond, the SPP chairman arrives to challenge Sitoh Yin.

\-I'm impressed by Jose's eloquence and he's one of those guys who doesn't show up every 5 years just to campaign and disappear. 

\-Based on social media posts and his own interview, he comes across as sincere and carries himself in a way that I think Chiam See Tong would approve of, having been inspired by the man himself. 

\-He's been a journalist and has a background in the Singapore Sports Council so he's got the CV and a sincerity in front of the camera. In a 2011 style election he'd win and be SPP's representative in Parliament.  

Bukit Batok SMC

\- Dr. Chee Soon Juan returns to take on Murali Pillai in a rematch of 2016's by-election where Murali with 62% of the vote.

\-Dr. Chee is a mainstay in politics although he was barred from running in any GE from 2001 to 2015 due him being bankrupt. In 2015 he attempted to contest Holland-Bukit Timah GRC but lost with only 33% of the vote.

\-Personally I think his party's ideas lean too much into welfare with little thought of how it will be paid for but in 2020 with the economy being bad, people might actually buy into his ideas and vote him in. 

Bukit Panjang SMC

\-Paul Tambyah might be from SDP but I actually think he's more capable than Dr. Chee and if anything he should be the face of SDP. 

\-His background in NCID and expertise on Covid-19  will be much needed in Parliament. Honestly one of the candidates I hope gets elected. He's in an SMC so there's no anchor minister to fend off and a favourable 2011 scenario would see him riding into Parliament. 

West Coast GRC

\-Tan Cheng Bock helms a team against PAP's own team led by S Iswaran. 

\-PSP goes into this fight with a lot of hype and Tan Cheng Bock seems to be really popular on the ground. It feels like he might just get what he wanted back in 2011 and 2017 and that is to be elected back into a government position. 

\-In a 2011 scenario I think he would probably take this 55-45 like WP did in Jurong. 

East Coast GRC

\-A Nicole Seah led WP team versus the PM-in waiting Heng Swee Keat, drafted in at the last minute possibly to counter Nicole Seah. 

\-I don't know if this is a brilliant move to plug a possible PAP loss without a guy like HSK anchoring the spot or PAP overestimating Heng's powers. 

\-Back in 2011 Nicole Seah was with NSP and scored an impressive 43% of the votes against the Marine Parade PAP team led by ESM Goh Chok Tong. Now she's in the WP blue and not surrounded by idiots, she can score an upset against HSK in a 2011 style situation who while a capable minister is no Goh Chok Tong. 

Jalan Besar GRC

\-The most surprising match up sees Lim Tean's PVP go up against Josephine Teo's PAP that is looking like a reenactment of the US Presidential Election of 2016. 

\-Personally I detest Lim Tean as a guy who seems to be overly critical of the PAP but up against Josephine Teo, the Minister of Manpower who really dropped the ball when it comes to the foreign worker dorm situation and one of the factors for the Circuit Breaker being implemented, I think he has a shot. 

\-Throw in an election with a scenario closer to 2011 and you'll get a very ugly upset where there are no real winners.

For me voting opposition isn’t about  undermining the local work of the incumbent, but considering whether the opposition will be able to serve a national purpose of being an alternative voice in parliament. We are lucky that we get to weigh out strong pros for the incumbent vs opposition compared to other areas that have to choose between the lesser of two evils. I myself am undecided recognising both the good work of Sitoh over the past two cycles and the value that Jose may bring by being a capable opposition candidate.

\-Hougang(WP)

\-Aljunied(WP)

\-Potong Pasir (SPP)

\-Bukit Batok(SDP)

\-Bukit Panjang(SDP)

\-West Coast (PSP)

\-East Coast(WP)

\-Jalan Besar(PVP)

&#x200B;

Hougang SMC & Aljunied GRC

\-Together they consist of 6 seats and are currently held by WP. As Hougang is the WP stronghold I don't see it going to PAP just yet, even if Png Eng Huat has stepped down. 2015 was a shock in seeing the WP vote share drop below 60% but if we get more of 2011 it shouldn't drop any lower. 

\-If voters opt for more of the same, its likely they keep Hougang and even Aljunied as this is not a situation like 2015. WP has held Aljunied for 9 years now and voters will know their neighbourhood didn't collapse or they needed to repent like what PAP said. 

Potong Pasir SMC

\-It went to PAP by the narrowest of margins in 2011 but they retained it comfortably in 2015. Now Jose Raymond, the SPP chairman arrives to challenge Sitoh Yin.

\-I'm impressed by Jose's eloquence and he's one of those guys who doesn't show up every 5 years just to campaign and disappear. 

\-Based on social media posts and his own interview, he comes across as sincere and carries himself in a way that I think Chiam See Tong would approve of, having been inspired by the man himself. 

\-He's been a journalist and has a background in the Singapore Sports Council so he's got the CV and a sincerity in front of the camera. In a 2011 style election he'd win and be SPP's representative in Parliament.  

Bukit Batok SMC

\- Dr. Chee Soon Juan returns to take on Murali Pillai in a rematch of 2016's by-election where Murali with 62% of the vote.

\-Dr. Chee is a mainstay in politics although he was barred from running in any GE from 2001 to 2015 due him being bankrupt. In 2015 he attempted to contest Holland-Bukit Timah GRC but lost with only 33% of the vote.

\-Personally I think his party's ideas lean too much into welfare with little thought of how it will be paid for but in 2020 with the economy being bad, people might actually buy into his ideas and vote him in. 

Bukit Panjang SMC

\-Paul Tambyah might be from SDP but I actually think he's more capable than Dr. Chee and if anything he should be the face of SDP. 

\-His background in NCID and expertise on Covid-19  will be much needed in Parliament. Honestly one of the candidates I hope gets elected. He's in an SMC so there's no anchor minister to fend off and a favourable 2011 scenario would see him riding into Parliament. 

West Coast GRC

\-Tan Cheng Bock helms a team against PAP's own team led by S Iswaran. 

\-PSP goes into this fight with a lot of hype and Tan Cheng Bock seems to be really popular on the ground. It feels like he might just get what he wanted back in 2011 and 2017 and that is to be elected back into a government position. 

\-In a 2011 scenario I think he would probably take this 55-45 like WP did in Jurong. 

East Coast GRC

\-A Nicole Seah led WP team versus the PM-in waiting Heng Swee Keat, drafted in at the last minute possibly to counter Nicole Seah. 

\-I don't know if this is a brilliant move to plug a possible PAP loss without a guy like HSK anchoring the spot or PAP overestimating Heng's powers. 

\-Back in 2011 Nicole Seah was with NSP and scored an impressive 43% of the votes against the Marine Parade PAP team led by ESM Goh Chok Tong. Now she's in the WP blue and not surrounded by idiots, she can score an upset against HSK in a 2011 style situation who while a capable minister is no Goh Chok Tong. 

Jalan Besar GRC

\-The most surprising match up sees Lim Tean's PVP go up against Josephine Teo's PAP that is looking like a reenactment of the US Presidential Election of 2016. 

\-Personally I detest Lim Tean as a guy who seems to be overly critical of the PAP but up against Josephine Teo, the Minister of Manpower who really dropped the ball when it comes to the foreign worker dorm situation and one of the factors for the Circuit Breaker being implemented, I think he has a shot. 

\-Throw in an election with a scenario closer to 2011 and you'll get a very ugly upset where there are no real winners.

\-If voters opt for more of the same, its likely they keep Hougang and even Aljunied as this is not a situation like 2015. WP has held Aljunied for 9 years now and voters will know their neighbourhood didn't collapse or they needed to repent like what PAP said. 

Potong Pasir SMC

\-It went to PAP by the narrowest of margins in 2011 but they retained it comfortably in 2015. Now Jose Raymond, the SPP chairman arrives to challenge Sitoh Yin.

\-I'm impressed by Jose's eloquence and he's one of those guys who doesn't show up every 5 years just to campaign and disappear. 

\-Based on social media posts and his own interview, he comes across as sincere and carries himself in a way that I think Chiam See Tong would approve of, having been inspired by the man himself. 

\-He's been a journalist and has a background in the Singapore Sports Council so he's got the CV and a sincerity in front of the camera. In a 2011 style election he'd win and be SPP's representative in Parliament.  

Bukit Batok SMC

\- Dr. Chee Soon Juan returns to take on Murali Pillai in a rematch of 2016's by-election where Murali with 62% of the vote.

\-Dr. Chee is a mainstay in politics although he was barred from running in any GE from 2001 to 2015 due him being bankrupt. In 2015 he attempted to contest Holland-Bukit Timah GRC but lost with only 33% of the vote.

\-Personally I think his party's ideas lean too much into welfare with little thought of how it will be paid for but in 2020 with the economy being bad, people might actually buy into his ideas and vote him in. 

Bukit Panjang SMC

\-Paul Tambyah might be from SDP but I actually think he's more capable than Dr. Chee and if anything he should be the face of SDP. 

\-His background in NCID and expertise on Covid-19  will be much needed in Parliament. Honestly one of the candidates I hope gets elected. He's in an SMC so there's no anchor minister to fend off and a favourable 2011 scenario would see him riding into Parliament. 

West Coast GRC

\-Tan Cheng Bock helms a team against PAP's own team led by S Iswaran. 

\-PSP goes into this fight with a lot of hype and Tan Cheng Bock seems to be really popular on the ground. It feels like he might just get what he wanted back in 2011 and 2017 and that is to be elected back into a government position. 

\-In a 2011 scenario I think he would probably take this 55-45 like WP did in Jurong. 

East Coast GRC

\-A Nicole Seah led WP team versus the PM-in waiting Heng Swee Keat, drafted in at the last minute possibly to counter Nicole Seah. 

\-I don't know if this is a brilliant move to plug a possible PAP loss without a guy like HSK anchoring the spot or PAP overestimating Heng's powers. 

\-Back in 2011 Nicole Seah was with NSP and scored an impressive 43% of the votes against the Marine Parade PAP team led by ESM Goh Chok Tong. Now she's in the WP blue and not surrounded by idiots, she can score an upset against HSK in a 2011 style situation who while a capable minister is no Goh Chok Tong. 

Jalan Besar GRC

\-The most surprising match up sees Lim Tean's PVP go up against Josephine Teo's PAP that is looking like a reenactment of the US Presidential Election of 2016. 

\-Personally I detest Lim Tean as a guy who seems to be overly critical of the PAP but up against Josephine Teo, the Minister of Manpower who really dropped the ball when it comes to the foreign worker dorm situation and one of the factors for the Circuit Breaker being implemented, I think he has a shot. 

\-Throw in an election with a scenario closer to 2011 and you'll get a very ugly upset where there are no real winners.

Do let me know what you guys think. Would the opposition's realistic best case be 23 or is it more or less?",I can only hope that I can see past my own bubble when needed. So far it seems like we're not in a bubble for this thread when it comes to discussing this but I'm not sure if it's shaped by cynicism or not.,2020-07-01 01:05:40
Best Case Scenario for the Opposition,"So now that nomination day has come and gone, I've decided to make my prediction for the opposition's best case scenario. This will be a realistic best case so you won't see things like PAP losing every seat because let's be honest, they won't based on the current matchups. Lee Hsien Loong is not losing to the Reform Party and neither is Tharman losing his race to Red Dot United. I'm not an expert political analyst so just take this as my two cents. If it happens, great. If it doesn't, then I guess I was wrong. Feel free to chime in and let me know what you think. 

I assume the situation will be closer to GE2011 than GE2015 when voters upset with how the PAP was running country limited them to a mere 60% of the popular vote and the loss of Aljunied GRC to the WP. In 2020 it will be them being upset with issues like the handling of Covid-19, maybe the Elected Presidency coupled with what looks like the best batch of Opposition politicians in decades to run for office. 

In this scenario I predict the Opposition will take 23 seats and it will be in the following SMCs and GRCs:

\-Hougang(WP)

\-Aljunied(WP)

\-Potong Pasir (SPP)

\-Bukit Batok(SDP)

\-Bukit Panjang(SDP)

Do let me know what you guys think. Would the opposition's realistic best case be 23 or is it more or less?","Same dilemma I have as you being a PP resident and a first-time voter. Both have their merits and we are lucky that there’s not as much of a “lesser of two evils” dilemma compared to other constituencies here. 

While the main PP area has definitely been spruced up, more can be done for Joo Seng/Woodleigh, though, which is the side I’m living on and where some of the benefits of living in PP are slightly inconvenient to access (CCs, etc.). With the newer HDB developments in the area, would be interesting to see what they bring to the table, no matter who is voted in.",2020-07-01 15:12:55

\-Based on social media posts and his own interview, he comes across as sincere and carries himself in a way that I think Chiam See Tong would approve of, having been inspired by the man himself. 

\-He's been a journalist and has a background in the Singapore Sports Council so he's got the CV and a sincerity in front of the camera. In a 2011 style election he'd win and be SPP's representative in Parliament.  

Bukit Batok SMC

\- Dr. Chee Soon Juan returns to take on Murali Pillai in a rematch of 2016's by-election where Murali with 62% of the vote.

\-Personally I think his party's ideas lean too much into welfare with little thought of how it will be paid for but in 2020 with the economy being bad, people might actually buy into his ideas and vote him in. 

Bukit Panjang SMC

\-Paul Tambyah might be from SDP but I actually think he's more capable than Dr. Chee and if anything he should be the face of SDP. 

\-His background in NCID and expertise on Covid-19  will be much needed in Parliament. Honestly one of the candidates I hope gets elected. He's in an SMC so there's no anchor minister to fend off and a favourable 2011 scenario would see him riding into Parliament.

\-Back in 2011 Nicole Seah was with NSP and scored an impressive 43% of the votes against the Marine Parade PAP team led by ESM Goh Chok Tong. Now she's in the WP blue and not surrounded by idiots, she can score an upset against HSK in a 2011 style situation who while a capable minister is no Goh Chok Tong. 

Jalan Besar GRC

\-The most surprising match up sees Lim Tean's PVP go up against Josephine Teo's PAP that is looking like a reenactment of the US Presidential Election of 2016. 

\-Personally I detest Lim Tean as a guy who seems to be overly critical of the PAP but up against Josephine Teo, the Minister of Manpower who really dropped the ball when it comes to the foreign worker dorm situation and one of the factors for the Circuit Breaker being implemented, I think he has a shot. 

\-Throw in an election with a scenario closer to 2011 and you'll get a very ugly upset where there are no real winners.

Do let me know what you guys think. Would the opposition's realistic best case be 23 or is it more or less?","Yeah, I was impressed that they got their video out first when they're not the ones calling the timing of the election. 

Plus, with the teaser, it gave the media things to talk about, which gave them even more visibility. So, yes, I'm excited for them (even if they're not contesting in my area).",2020-06-30 23:18:55
Best Case Scenario for the Opposition,"So now that nomination day has come and gone, I've decided to make my prediction for the opposition's best case scenario. This will be a realistic best case so you won't see things like PAP losing every seat because let's be honest, they won't based on the current matchups. Lee Hsien Loong is not losing to the Reform Party and neither is Tharman losing his race to Red Dot United. I'm not an expert political analyst so just take this as my two cents. If it happens, great. If it doesn't, then I guess I was wrong. Feel free to chime in and let me know what you think. 

I assume the situation will be closer to GE2011 than GE2015 when voters upset with how the PAP was running country limited them to a mere 60% of the popular vote and the loss of Aljunied GRC to the WP. In 2020 it will be them being upset with issues like the handling of Covid-19, maybe the Elected Presidency coupled with what looks like the best batch of Opposition politicians in decades to run for office. 

In this scenario I predict the Opposition will take 23 seats and it will be in the following SMCs and GRCs:

\-If voters opt for more of the same, its likely they keep Hougang and even Aljunied as this is not a situation like 2015. WP has held Aljunied for 9 years now and voters will know their neighbourhood didn't collapse or they needed to repent like what PAP said.

\-Personally I think his party's ideas lean too much into welfare with little thought of how it will be paid for but in 2020 with the economy being bad, people might actually buy into his ideas and vote him in. 

Bukit Panjang SMC

\-Paul Tambyah might be from SDP but I actually think he's more capable than Dr. Chee and if anything he should be the face of SDP. 

\-His background in NCID and expertise on Covid-19  will be much needed in Parliament. Honestly one of the candidates I hope gets elected. He's in an SMC so there's no anchor minister to fend off and a favourable 2011 scenario would see him riding into Parliament.

\-In a 2011 scenario I think he would probably take this 55-45 like WP did in Jurong. 

East Coast GRC

\-I don't know if this is a brilliant move to plug a possible PAP loss without a guy like HSK anchoring the spot or PAP overestimating Heng's powers. 

\-Back in 2011 Nicole Seah was with NSP and scored an impressive 43% of the votes against the Marine Parade PAP team led by ESM Goh Chok Tong. Now she's in the WP blue and not surrounded by idiots, she can score an upset against HSK in a 2011 style situation who while a capable minister is no Goh Chok Tong.

\-Throw in an election with a scenario closer to 2011 and you'll get a very ugly upset where there are no real winners.

Do let me know what you guys think. Would the opposition's realistic best case be 23 or is it more or less?","Yes definitely! It’s worrying that we are the largest cluster, and the recent heavy rain + many construction sites (due to HDB development) and not forgetting the foliage surrounding the old cemetery area are a big contributing factor. Lots of seniors on this side too, so there needs to be some infrastructure in place to curb the spread. 

Also noticed that the Joo Seng / Woodleigh area hasn’t been on the radar until recent years due to the new HDB estate developments, and given the near nature-reserve status of the Bidadari area as well, another point of contention would also be plans to conservation of nature while having plans for to improve the area in general which has ruffled the feathers of nature enthusiasts. More accessible facilities would be great, too, esp. since the CC is a good 20 mins walk away from me and it’s harder for us on this side to enjoy and access :(

Reading both manifestos so far, it’s definitely going to be a very close fight I believe. This is exciting haha. Guess we will have to see!",2020-07-01 22:04:43
Best Case Scenario for the Opposition,"So now that nomination day has come and gone, I've decided to make my prediction for the opposition's best case scenario. This will be a realistic best case so you won't see things like PAP losing every seat because let's be honest, they won't based on the current matchups. Lee Hsien Loong is not losing to the Reform Party and neither is Tharman losing his race to Red Dot United. I'm not an expert political analyst so just take this as my two cents. If it happens, great. If it doesn't, then I guess I was wrong. Feel free to chime in and let me know what you think. 

I assume the situation will be closer to GE2011 than GE2015 when voters upset with how the PAP was running country limited them to a mere 60% of the popular vote and the loss of Aljunied GRC to the WP. In 2020 it will be them being upset with issues like the handling of Covid-19, maybe the Elected Presidency coupled with what looks like the best batch of Opposition politicians in decades to run for office. 

In this scenario I predict the Opposition will take 23 seats and it will be in the following SMCs and GRCs:

\-Hougang(WP)

\-Aljunied(WP)

\-Potong Pasir (SPP)

\-Bukit Batok(SDP)

\-Bukit Panjang(SDP)

\-West Coast (PSP)

\-East Coast(WP)

\-Jalan Besar(PVP)

&#x200B;

Hougang SMC & Aljunied GRC

\-Together they consist of 6 seats and are currently held by WP. As Hougang is the WP stronghold I don't see it going to PAP just yet, even if Png Eng Huat has stepped down. 2015 was a shock in seeing the WP vote share drop below 60% but if we get more of 2011 it shouldn't drop any lower. 

\-If voters opt for more of the same, its likely they keep Hougang and even Aljunied as this is not a situation like 2015. WP has held Aljunied for 9 years now and voters will know their neighbourhood didn't collapse or they needed to repent like what PAP said. 

Potong Pasir SMC

\-It went to PAP by the narrowest of margins in 2011 but they retained it comfortably in 2015. Now Jose Raymond, the SPP chairman arrives to challenge Sitoh Yin.

\-I'm impressed by Jose's eloquence and he's one of those guys who doesn't show up every 5 years just to campaign and disappear. 

\-Based on social media posts and his own interview, he comes across as sincere and carries himself in a way that I think Chiam See Tong would approve of, having been inspired by the man himself. 

\-He's been a journalist and has a background in the Singapore Sports Council so he's got the CV and a sincerity in front of the camera. In a 2011 style election he'd win and be SPP's representative in Parliament.

> SINGAPORE - Employers here will have to let the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) move their foreign workers to different dormitories or work at another company in need of manpower in order to get the foreign worker levy (FWL) rebates announced in last week's Fortitude Budget.

> In a statement on Sunday (May 31), MOM said that in view of the support given, employers must also continue paying the salaries of foreign workers who are unable to work due to the Covid-19 situation.

> ""In such cases, employers should work out mutually agreed salary and leave arrangements with the unions and workers.

> ""Foreign workers who are assigned to work full-time should be paid their prevailing salaries,"" said the ministry.

> Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, who is also Finance Minister, had announced on May 26 that the Government will extend the FWL waivers and rebates for up to two months, for businesses not allowed to resume operations after the circuit breaker period.

> The waiver will be 100 per cent in June, and 50 per cent in July, while the rebate will be $750 in June, and $375 in July.

> These apply to businesses not in the Ministry of Trade and Industry's permitted list on GoBusiness Portal, along with all businesses in construction, marine shipyard and process sectors.

> To receive the rebates, MOM said the employers will have to accept two conditions.

> First, they must allow MOM to move work permit holders and S Pass holders cleared of Covid-19 from existing dormitories to a cleared dormitory, to facilitate workers returning to work.

> Related Story Foreign worker levy waiver, rebates extended by up to 2 months for firms unable to resume work after circuit breaker

> Related Story Why Singapore cannot cut down on foreign workers the way other countries have

> ""Employers may be required to terminate the leases with their current dormitory operator to recontract with a new dormitory operator,"" said MOM.

> Second, the employers must allow MOM to second or transfer their workers to another company that needs workers, but whose own workers are in dormitories that have not been cleared.

> All employers must make an online acknowledgement of the conditions by June 10.

> ""This support will taper off as we ease out of the circuit breaker and restart our economy.

> ""Businesses that expect to restart later are encouraged to reassess their foreign manpower needs and adjust their workforce accordingly,"" MOM said.

I not sure how you misread this. This is actually a good thing for the workers. This is permitting workers to change job.

It's good that MOH puts this to rest. People speculate when given insufficient information.

MOM issued advisories to FDW employers on Mar 20 to ask their FDWs to stay home (not compulsory at that point though).

> Only 17 foreign domestic workers (FDWs) here have been confirmed with Covid-19 so far, and they did not get it from foreign workers.

> Most of them were infected by their employers, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in response to The New Paper's queries on Sunday .

> Among the 17, Cases 102, 104 and 108 were linked to the Wizlearn Technologies cluster.

> All three had employers who were either employees of Wizlearn Technologies or were linked to employees.

> Another infected FDW was Case 21, a 44-year-old Indonesian. Her employer, Case 19, worked at the Yong Thai Hang health products shop, which was one of the earliest clusters. The cluster has since been closed.

> With the number of infections among foreign workers living in dormitories shooting up, there has been speculation that maids may have come into contact with infected foreign workers on their rest days.

> A WhatsApp message claimed that the situation could ""very quickly spiral out of control"" if maids met infected workers and carried the virus back to their employers.

> Addressing these concerns in an interview with Lianhe Zaobao last Friday, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said: ""First of all, now (FDWs) can't go out, and second, when you drill down on the data, the rate of infection among foreign domestic workers is very low.

> ""The evidence we have so far is that they get the infection from their employers, not from outside.""

> STAY HOME

> On April 11, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said all maids must stay home on their rest days, except to buy meals or run essential errands.

> Mr William Lau, general manager of employment agency Maid Avenue, was not surprised by the low rate of infection among maids.

> He said: ""Even before the circuit breaker started, many FDWs were already staying at home and minimising contact with outsiders.

> ""Adding to that, MOM's recent announcement sent a very strong message to FDWs - it is no longer just an instruction from their employers.""

> A spokesman for the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (Home) said of the WhatsApp message: ""Perpetuating such messages targets the migrant worker community unfairly as it is speculative.""

> The Home spokesman said employers should not be unduly worried about their maids being infected since all parties are subjected to the same circuit breaker measures.

> Ms Josephine Chia, 44, a mother of two children aged four and six, said that while employers have valid concerns about infections among FDWs, the WhatsApp message ""irresponsible fearmongering"".

> Ms Chia, who now accompanies her Filipina helper to remit money, said: ""Of course there is a basis for worry, but we should remain calm and logical about it, especially as the low number of infected FDWs provides some reassurance.""

 No...maids also date expats, locals but those are the more 'elite' maids. 

But many of them are in fairly transient sexual relationships with the migrant labourer set.

Singaporeans think that when they hire a mid they are buying an appliance with no feelings...like a washing machine or dishwasher or vacuum cleaner. They want maids to slog for them at all hours and not go anywhere on their off days...not to have relationships with the opposite sex....maids are not zoo animals.

Rethinking dorms: Next steps for foreign worker housing in Singapore,,Current minimum living space stipulations are the equivalent of 20 people living in a four room HDB as per the article.

Rethinking dorms: Next steps for foreign worker housing in Singapore,,">On hygiene in dorms, Mr Cheah, who is also president of the Dormitory Association of Singapore, said **the reality has been distorted by inaccurate information on social media**.  
>  
>**""The dorms in Singapore are governed by better legislation than that in many countries with a migrant worker population,"" he said.**

This says absolutely nothing and is barely a rebuttal to the videos showing the sordid conditions that the workers were living in. Which other first world countries have huge migrant worker populations? How dare this guy, who knows he is speaking on behalf the dorm operators, speak as though the dorm operators deserve a part on the back for simply not being worse than Dubai and Saudi Arabia? He even has the gall to claim that ""reality has been distorted"" without offering an ounce of proof that the conditions shown in the videos were unrepresentative of realities on the ground. We're not expecting dorm operator CEOs to commit seppuku, but at least have the bare decency to admit that mistakes were made. God.

Also just because there is legislation doesn't mean that these have been adhered to or properly enforced. Otherwise, [we wouldn't have half of dorms breaching regulations last year](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/nearly-half-of-large-dorms-breach-rules-each-year-minister).

>  
>But, according to Mr Cheah, the bulk of dorm operators have been struggling in the last few years due to lower-than-projected occupancy, payment delinquency and bad debts.

If the hard statistics that we have are showing $35 million a year in profits for the big dorm operators, then Mr Cheah better bring out some real proof that dorm operators in general are actually struggling with operating costs. Otherwise, it would seem awfully convenient that only the operators that have disclosed their financial performances to the public are doing well, while all the other operators are apparently barely making profits.",2020-05-26 16:28:52

Rethinking dorms: Next steps for foreign worker housing in Singapore,,"Most likely its also because its a highly regulated industry (at least at the planning stage maybe not so much on enforcement).

>"" this would require the authorities to review current building guidelines for dorms, such as increasing the gross plot ratio, which limits, among other things, building heights. ""

Meaning that there seems to only be certain designated plots of lands of specific sizes and in specific areas that are allowed for dormitories, no doubt due to our government's extreme focus on city planning. It also seems that there is quite limited land area currently allowed for these types of buildings, perhaps the government not wanting to give up too much land space for 'temporary' workers.

>""Current dorms typically have lease terms of between nine and 30 years.""

Makes sense that why would any developer want to spend the capital to build these  nicer and more spacious dormitories when the land goes back to the government in 10 years. Hence the unwillingness to go beyond the bare minimum.

In any case the dorms were built to current government regulations, albeit at the minimum requirements. This is the area which should have the most focus for change along of course with enforcement.

I don't think you can expect private businesses to do anything more than the legal minimum as there will always be a race to the bottom for an industry as competitive as this.

> More than 10 million meals have been served to foreign workers since some purpose-built dormitories went into lockdown, with food caterers seeking to address concerns raised about their quality and quantity.

> This is no mean feat, as noted by Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad, who said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that the inter-agency task force set up to support the workers would have served over 10 million meals to those in the purpose-built dorms by this weekend.

> He said there are 34 professional caterers providing meals to about 200,000 workers - akin to catering for the whole of Ang Mo Kio GRC. The Government is footing the bill for all meals in purpose-built dorms. It is not clear how much the caterers are charging but one of them, Neo Group, said it charges only for ingredients and labour costs.

> Teething issues early on sparked criticism about the quality, quantity and the type of cuisine served up but this has improved, said Mr Zaqy.

> He told The Straits Times that these issues stemmed from logistics challenges generated by the sheer number of residents in the dorms.

> The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is now ensuring that meals are delivered to residents within 30 minutes of their arrival at the dorms. Tests are also being done with workers from different countries to ensure that the food suits their tastes.

> ""Some of them prefer a certain variety of rice, like ponni rice, and requested the rice to be cooked for a longer period of time,"" said Mr Zaqy.

> The first catered meal given to Bangladeshi Ahammad Md Ali, 27, when his dorm was gazetted as an isolation area and locked down about two weeks ago was a bag of rice and Indian curry.

> He was happy to chomp it down but some of his Bangladeshi friends at Westlite Mandai dormitory found it harder to stomach.

> ""The food is OK to 'makan' (eat in Malay), but Bangladeshi food is different from Indian food. Some of us are only used to Bangladeshi food,"" said Mr Ahammad, a safety coordinator who has worked here for seven years.

> ""Bangladeshi food is less salty. We gave feedback, the next day they sent Bangladeshi food,"" he added, noting that he usually cooks his own meals in the dorm.

> The Covid-19 outbreak has resulted in about 300,000 workers having their movements restricted due to quarantine or stay-home notices, prompting the authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and employers to step in to ensure that daily needs are met.

> ACTION AFTER FEEDBACK The food is OK to 'makan' (eat in Malay), but Bangladeshi food is different from Indian food, some of us are only used to Bangladeshi food... Bangladeshi food is less salty. We gave feedback, the next day they sent Bangladeshi food. BANGLADESHI AHAMMAD MD ALI, a safety coordinator who has worked here for seven years.

> Meanwhile, the Covid-19 Migrant Support Coalition comprising NGOs and ground-up initiatives has provided around 17,000 meals to workers in factory-converted dorms and other types of accommodation over the past three weeks.

> Migrant Workers' Centre chairman Yeo Guat Kwang said in this ""unprecedented situation"" everyone, including workers and caterers, has had to adapt and adjust: ""It's understandable the workers are upset at the restrictions.

> ""Just like you and me, it's hard to give up choice and habits, such as being able to cook for yourself.""

> Indian construction worker Kandan Gopinath, 41, said the food in his PPT Lodge 1A dorm has improved over the past week.

> When the dorm was gazetted as an isolation area on April 19, the meals were bland as they lacked the spices he was used to.

> ""The rice was half-cooked and there were only boiled vegetables and a little curry,"" he said, adding that things changed after he raised the issue with the dorm operator.

> ""These few days, the food has been good, like fish curry. But sometimes it can be very oily,"" he said.

> Similarly, caterers who have taken on the task of feeding the hundreds of thousands of workers have had to adapt to the diets of at least six different nationalities.

> Catering Solutions, which provides food for five purpose-built dorms, has ramped up its production from 20,000 meals a day to almost 70,000 in the past few weeks, said director Shanmugam Ganesan.

> It had previously been catering for workers at Jurong Shipyard and Sembcorp Marine in Tuas, but providing for a bigger group has seen it tweaking its menus according to workers' feedback. It provides Chinese, Indian, Bangladeshi and Punjabi dishes.

> ""We adjusted the kinds of fish, vegetables and portioning of curries,"" said Mr Shanmugam, adding that extra portions of rice are also prepared just in case.

> Catering Solutions has hired 60 workers to add to its workforce of 100 and tapped technology - it has a number of chapati-making machines - to increase production.

> Its kitchens are working 24 hours a day, up from 18, to provide pre-dawn meals for Muslim workers in the dorms during Ramadan.

> Mr Ong Yong Shun, an MOM officer deployed at Changi Lodge 2, acknowledged the initial dissatisfaction about the meals but said feedback has led to an improvement in quality. Forward assurance support, or ""Fast"", teams stationed in the dorms have been having the same meals as the workers, he said.

> ""This ensures first-hand knowledge of the quality of every meal served and enables us to be proactive in feedback given,"" he said.

Some first-steps I am guessing they will take: 

1) Regulate the number of beds/pax per room, with clearly specified spacing (e.g.: beds to  be 1m apart, bunk beds to be 2m apart etc.)  

2) To ensure privately catered lunches meet food safety standards, else caterers and employers will face a fine or more (I still have no idea how, with the timestamp requirement now, caterers are still allowed to drop off their breakfast and lunch at 7AM??)

Will we see conversation opening up about the treatment of foreign workers and dorm conditions after CB?,"I think we can more or less agree that condition of the dorms contributed quite significantly to the spread of COVID amongst FW, will we see more conversations/ investigations regarding this matter?","Dorms are a problem because employers are required to provide housing unlike for other residents     

Whereas if there was a universal minimum wage say $15 hour (rising with cost of providing at least a room per worker) and universal rights to housing access, no separation by pass level as there is now and strictly not linked to employment, then most of the dorms would disappear. 

I've worked in most of the major countries in Europe and not really come across the concept of worker dormitories as there are here, I mean it's not unusual for immigrant workers to share the rent on a house etc but that comes down to the choice of individuals and the minimum wage ensures that at least a reasonable standard of living is guaranteed.",2020-04-21 21:02:11
Will we see conversation opening up about the treatment of foreign workers and dorm conditions after CB?,"I think we can more or less agree that condition of the dorms contributed quite significantly to the spread of COVID amongst FW, will we see more conversations/ investigations regarding this matter?","Actually, in first world countries, minimum wage are not given, and most do not have it. Although it seems good on the surface as some argue that it helps balance disparity between wages and reduces poverty level, it may not be entirely true.

Minimum wage is the least an employer can legally pay a worker. This may cause employers to raise standards (3 year work experience only, graduates in related field only, etc) that may not justify the wage to be paid. In the short term view, people may lose jobs/opportunities to get jobs. People who are willing to get paid less to do the same work in order to get paid cannot legally do so, and people who get the job are often over qualified and overworked.

The problem with dorms in sg is more of how they are set up, rather than their existence. If set up well and maintained, it would function like a housing grant (or properties) provided by certain companies offer. I think in Europe's context it also depends where in Europe you are looking at, but it is also in part due to their comparatively low (and long term) rental rates that you don't see such dorms around.",2020-04-22 02:09:07

I think the main party mentioning this is SDP, with CSJ regularly highlighting prior to the election about the  whole mask debacle and not locking down earlier. However, the angle he is taking is that these actions shows that the PAP is “inhumane” etc and doesn’t care about the health of citizens and are just greedy. (Up to you to decide whether that is a fair judgement)

Side note, opposition parties did use FW to attack the PAP in previous elections. In GE 2011, LTK brought up the issue of the government constructing a foreign worker dormitory near Serangoon Gardens, and how they did not listen to the concerns of residents and just went ahead to build it. Given that he won, that angle seems to resonate more with the electorate than the welfare of foreign workers.

That said, I can guarantee that there will be reforms with the FW dorms post elections. The government will have no choice but to issue new standards for dormitories and enforce them highly, given how the lax standards greatly affected the economy.",2020-06-30 22:49:19

Singapore has always taken pride in being a beacon for global free enterprise. We are frequently reminded that our prosperity is based on a system of being open to business.

We have argued that our system works because it does not mollycoddle people amid the realities of the free market.

Why should a society that takes pride in not sheltering people from the realities of the free market system find it acceptable to shelter large corporations from the same?

The reality of the free market system is that it allows you to succeed with minimal government interference, but at the same time you are on your own if you fail.

The dormitory operators are not innovative start-ups coming up with market-disrupting products that will shape the future. They are not enterprises that hire many Singaporeans in high-paying jobs.

They make vast profits - Centurion Corp, for example, made $103.8 million on revenue of $133 million for the 12 months ended Dec 31 last year - merely by maximising the number of people in a certain space.

If our system allows them to earn profits in this manner, should we not also allow them to bear the cost when the system requires them to adapt their businesses to new realities?

I have very little faith in these dorm operators to suddenly step up and spend their earnings to help solve the current issue at hand, and I predict they will leave most of their workers in the lurch, painting an even worse image of Singapore to the other countries.

It is unfortunate, but I feel that the current handling of the situation is probably the best way, but I really hope that MoM will step up on their regulations and scrutinize these dorm operators with a very close eye after the entire COVID-19 situation blows over.",2020-05-23 12:32:16

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (16 April) reported a record 728 more COVID-19 cases in Singapore – a 62 per cent jump from the previous daily high – taking its total to 4,427.

> The announcement also marks the seventh consecutive day with no imported cases and comes one day after the city-state reported 447 new cases.

> MORE TO COME

> The MOH on Thursday also confirmed that 31 more patients have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, bringing the total of recovered cases to 683.

> On Wednesday, most of the 1,496 hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while 26 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit, down from 28 on Tuesday.

> A total of 1,540 cases who are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19 are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Ten have died from complications due to COVID-19 infection, including a 70-year-old Singaporean man on Tuesday.

> Another two patients, who tested positive for the virus, have died from causes unrelated to COVID-19.

> At least 23 clusters linked to foreign worker dormitories have been identified thus far, including the largest cluster of 797 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol.

> As of Tuesday noon, the MOH said it has identified 30,646 close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 12,797 are currently quarantined, and 17,849 have completed their quarantine.

> In the MOH’s latest daily situation report, 7,700 of 65,300 issued stay-home notices remain active.

> The COVID-19 Temporary Measures Act, passed in Parliament last Tuesday, gives authorities the power to ban events and gatherings, or impose conditions on how they are conducted, during the “circuit breaker” period from 7 April to 4 May.

> Those caught flouting the enhanced safe distancing measures for the first time will be given a composition fine of $300, and a $1,000 fine for the second time.

> Egregious cases will be prosecuted in court. A first-time offender who is prosecuted under the Act can face a maximum fine of $10,000, or a jail term of up to six months, or both. A second-time or subsequent offender can face a maximum fine of $20,000, or a jail term of up to a year, or both.

> On Tuesday, authorities said that mask-wearing while going out would be mandatory and offenders will face similar penalties. Exceptions to the rule include children under the age of 2, individuals who are excused from wearing masks on medical grounds, and those doing strenuous exercise.

> People who flout their five-day medical leave or stay-home notices are also subjected to similar penalties.

> Part of the “circuit breaker” measures – announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 3 April – include the closure of schools and most workplaces. Only essential services like food establishments, markets and supermarkets, transport, and key banking services will remain open during the month-long closure.

> In a Good Friday address last week, Lee reiterated his call for Singaporeans to stay home, as COVID-19 cases continue to rise in foreign worker dormitories as well as in the general population.

> Over the weekend, the authorities issued a slew of measures, including the closure of beaches, facilities in parks and gardens and playfields.

> Stadiums have also been closed, while parents are not allowed to drop off their children with grandparents on a daily basis.

> Separately, all Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning from overseas apart from Hubei province must serve the 14-day stay-home notice, while those returning from Hubei must serve a 14-day quarantine.

> All short-term visitors are barred from entering or transiting via Singapore.

> Last Monday, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced an additional $5.1 billion Solidarity Budget to help businesses, workers and households.

> The government’s response to COVID-19 will total $59.9 billion, or about 12 per cent of Singapore’s gross domestic product.

> To date, there are close to 2.1 million COVID-19 cases globally – it took 83 days to reach the first million cases worldwide and just 14 days for the second million.

> Some 136,000 have died from the virus, with the US holding the record for the highest global death toll at over 28,000.

> At over 640,000 cases, the country also holds the record of having the largest number of patients globally, followed by Spain at over 182,000 cases, Italy at over 165,000, and France at over 147,000.

> China, where the virus originated, has reported over 82,000 cases and more than 3,300 deaths.

If this is anywhere near a representative sample, this implies ~1 million active cases in New York City, compared to 111,424 confirmed cases.

Given that MOH is said to be testing everyone in the dorms in a similar fashion, regardless of symptoms, we might be seeing the same thing play out.

"COVID-19: Singapore confirms record 728 new cases, majority linked; total at 4,427",,"Did you honestly think MOM/MOH failed to foresee this? They probably did because every individual in Singapore had a higher probability to be infected when we allowed tens of thousands of msians to come into Singapore when MCO was implemented there as well as the returning Singaporeans from abroad. None of the msians served a 14 day SHN while it took some time before returning citizens were quarantined in hotels. Some clusters have already formed there and then and it's untraceable. Could even be linked originally from Msia/western countries.

Especially so for the FW workers who may be dealing with medical waste or waste in general. Used masks from an unknowingly infected carrier etc.. Transmission in this case was inevitable but our strategy in dealing with the virus at that time was reactive to the facts present at hand...

TBH I'm sure they were probably just crossing their fingers that the virus doesn't get to our FW workers dormitories. How could they not foresee? Social distancing was already being preached before the spread in the dormitories and any retard in MOM can tell you that those dormitories are not benchmarks of safe distancing.

It was just that the authorities are just biding their time waiting for it to happen before they 'react' to the 'facts' once again. For years MOM has nv really been a champion of FW rights. It's really evident now because you see all the dirt surfacing about how they are treated by their employers and how dorm operators are allowed to get away scot free for their deplorable management. It really is a case of out of sight out of mind. It has really been rotten for quite awhile and this covid19 truly brought out the stink.

Seriously there needs to be heavy enforcement and penalties for errant employers not just those of FW labourers but those of any immigrant (hello fake degree mills). What we lack sorely is an independent ombudsman that doesn't scream conflict of interest. We really exposed ourselves greatly when we allowed such a sizeable workforce from Msia to enter or risk crippling our economy. We have become far too dependent on cheap labour. It's a sick addiction. We need to think about what life's like without them. I'm not advocating for an exodus but a healthy sizeable reduction where we can still stand on our 2 feet or at least hobble along. Delicate balancing act way above my pay grade. Simply put, businesses have to innovate and invest towards less labour intensive technologies because it's damn certain no Singaporean can compete with the wages of a msian living in msia. Its simple mathematics.

PA grassroots leaders helloooo?? Too many scratching of backs within our govt and associated businesses. We need proper investigative journalism to call out these folks because they have sat on their high horses far too long to the detriment of greater society. In short.. follow the money.

I'm more pissed at MOM allowing the labour situation to be the state it is in now then the covid19 numbers. It was a time bomb that has been ticking for years prior to this. The reform doesn't just need to come in addressing migrant workers' living and working conditions in the near immediate future but as well our will to wean ourselves off cheap foreign labour so that we are not vulnerable to their absence as well as making businesses pay a liveable wage to the local workforce. It should also be legislated that no CEO should earn 1000 times the lowest paid employee to push for a more equitable distribution of wealth within a company. I have a dream...

In a dark way I'm kinda glad that covid19 has happened the way it did if not all these issues will never come to light and remain under the rug. It will definitely cause many countries around the world to look inwards as well and we are no exception. This globalisation machine needs some major recalibration before more Trump-like politics take over the world and I'm speaking as someone who is pro globalisation.

PAP's intention of capitalising on this period to hold elections to have us riding on the ""feel good"" wave when our numbers were not that crappy have backfired big time. It really speaks of their arrogance in insulting our intelligence. They did the same with LKY's death back in 2015 to great success. There are so many domestic issues to be debated and addressed before voters can exercise their rights in an informed manner. But I'm also guessing their arrogance is fuelled by our political ignorance. So people need to be less apolitical unless you're on either side of the camp no matter what. There should be more than one voice in a healthy society were the words muttered by the chinese Dr. Li Wenliang who blew the whistle on this virus.

>“There was a very specific reason we built these dormitories. They were designed for communal living, where the workers could live together, socialise with their friends, prepare meals they liked, practice their religious beliefs... It’s a supportive environment for the workers,” said Teo.

>In terms of living conditions, she described workers’ shared rooms as being about the size of half a badminton court accommodating five bunk beds, with “another 20 per cent for circulation space”.

>Such dormitories are also managed by professional operators, which are regulated.

>“Among other things, they have the responsibility to ensure modern sanitation and no over-crowding,” said Teo.

>Around 1,200 factory-converted dormitories across the island house about 95,000 workers. These facilities tend to be smaller and house about 50 to 100 workers each, although some can take in around 500.

"COVID-19: Singapore confirms record 728 new cases, majority linked; total at 4,427",,"""they didn't know the risk"" might be letting them off way too lightly.

in 2015 when the dorms bill was passed, multiple MPs mentioned outbreaks of infectious diseases.

  
**Mr Gan Thiam Poh:** Whether it is a smaller dorm with a few hundred residents or a bigger one with 1,000, similar problems could arise. In the event of an infectious disease outbreak, racial or national tension, for example, the tipping point can be reached at 100 or 200 workers. 

**Yeo Guat Kwang:** the licensing framework will no doubt enhance the ability to deal with large-scale public and personal security, and even health and also pandemic incidents arising within dormitories. 

**Lee Bee Wah:** I would think putting a few hundred people under a roof is a sizeable crowd. It poses challenges to manage even with just 50 people under one roof, from fire safety, cooking area, toilets to space for clothes. Failure to manage the living quarters of a few hundred people can certainly give way to problems in terms of public health and safety, security and public order.

**Ms Foo Mee Har:** I am also pleased with the requirement for sick bay isolation facilities to contain any infectious disease outbreak, which could spread quickly in a densely populated dormitory.

**Tan Chuan Jin:** We are also aware of healthcare concerns. For smaller dorms or smaller accommodation spaces, when outbreaks happen, you can manage it, you have quarantine. But when you have a much larger dorm, the requirements are quite different, the scale is very different. We need to weave this into the design of the dormitories themselves.",2020-04-17 01:06:08

"COVID-19: Singapore confirms record 728 new cases, majority linked; total at 4,427",,"Yes, they may have died from other conditions, but I’m sure Covid must have played a part in leading to their demise as well. With Covid, and their other health problems, they are essentially fighting two health conditions at once. Which definitely takes a toll on one’s immune system.

If their immune system wasn’t too busy fighting Covid, these patients may have lived another few days. Without Covid, their body would only be fighting one serious health condition and they may have managed to find the strength to recover from that ONE serious health condition. With Covid-19 serving as an unfortunate distractor, the patient’s body’s resources were split up fighting TWO serious health conditions and I’m sure this must have played a part in terms of weakening the patient’s body

While the patient may have officially passed from reasons separate to the coronavirus, I’m certain that the coronavirus had at least a small part to play in their demise.

Classing their deaths as “non-Covid19” deaths is not the right call in my opinion as it plays down the severity of the virus [some people might say “oh look! these people died, but its not from the virus! this means other disease more scary than covid. covid not scary, might as well go out!”]",2020-04-17 01:14:48

Actually, out of the 87 cases in the cluster, the great majority are Singaporeans. I looked through the entire list and only a few cases could possibly be dorm residents, and none of these have confirmed links to any dorm/construction cluster:

\#908: 36 yo male Bangladeshi, may be linked to #788 (57 yo SG woman)

\#938: 64 yo male Indian (probably too old to be a dorm resident)

\#964: 27 yo male Indian

\#1015: 41 yo male Indian

\#1056: 40 yo male Bangladeshi

\#1219: 29 yo male Indian

\#1259: 36 yo male Chinese

In other words, while it's likely that at least one dorm cluster started at Mustafa, the links haven't been identified. Mustafa staff got sick (some of the above could be staff, not dorm workers) and could have infected a lot of random people.",2020-04-17 10:55:23
"COVID-19: Singapore confirms record 728 new cases, majority linked; total at 4,427",,"That’s fascinating!

ETA Singapore once again  is in the position to contribute to worldwide understanding of the virus’ spread. The dorms are somewhat akin to DP, in that it’s a fairly closed system. 

A recent paper broke down categories of infectiousness by transmission route:
“Evidence exists for each of these routes of transmission: symptomatic (12), pre-symptomatic (13); asymptomatic (14); and environmental (12). For prevention, the crucial information is the relative frequency of different routes of transmission so as to allocate finite resources between different intervention strategies.”
The data that can be gleaned from the current crisis, given the impressive if not miraculous diligence in the Singaporeans’ response, will likely guide worldwide reopening of society building on this.

"COVID-19: Singapore confirms record 728 new cases, majority linked; total at 4,427",,"That's a spurious statement to make. Local community transmissions among Singaporeans today is less than 50 and has been low compared to foreign worker cases. Bulk of Covid19 transmissions are among low-wage foreign workers, and the reason is down to the government's long-term inaction over unsanitary living conditions and failure to be ready for a virus outbreak after a few Bangladeshis contracted Covid19 in February despite the warning from migrant workers charities that viruses like dengue and zika also hit dormitories hard. It's a failure of MOM's labour law policy that 12 workers squeeze into prison like dorms, how does complacency from the average citizen have anything to do with the massive outbreaks of zika, dengue and coronavirus among FWs?

Ministers got complacent. It already happened before with zika and dengue and FWs are the biggest at risk group for viruses but Singapore's government doesn't bother to protect migrant worker welfare, here their health and lives are cheap.",2020-04-17 00:08:50
"COVID-19: Singapore confirms record 728 new cases, majority linked; total at 4,427",,"the virus doesn't just magically appear. every other migrant worker has a singaporean supervisor. it's entirely possible that the spread in dorms were seeded by many different workers who had been in contact with multiple asymptomatic locals, imo.",2020-04-17 00:57:03
"COVID-19: Singapore confirms record 728 new cases, majority linked; total at 4,427",,The point though is how did they come in contact with the virus in February?

"COVID-19: Singapore confirms record 728 new cases, majority linked; total at 4,427",,"Mustafa staff got infected. Whether they got infected by Singaporeans or tourists or dorm workers, we don't know. But it's quite possible that Mustafa staff were the intermediary that transmitted from local or imported cases, to the worker dorms.

We don't actually know that ""a few Bangladeshi/Indian workers already got the virus in February and started spreading it"". The initial cluster of 5 Bangladeshi workers at Seletar Aerospace construction site happened in February, but officially they didn't spread it to anybody else. The next Bangladeshi to be confirmed was #658 on 25 March, a few days before the dorm clusters started growing. The earliest case linked to Mustafa was a Malaysian man, also confirmed on 25 March.

I would say it's more likely that ""we"" spread it to Mustafa and then to the foreign worker community than the other way around.",2020-04-17 11:33:17

"COVID-19: Singapore confirms record 728 new cases, majority linked; total at 4,427",,"I believe an earlier lockdown would have prevented spreading in dorms as well.

Let’s say there are three dorms, Dorms A, B and C.

On February 19, a person from Dorm A met someone from Dorm B at Mustafa. The person from Dorm A passed the coronavirus to the person from Dorm B. The residents of Dorm B thus became infected. An earlier lockdown would have prevented this transmission, but it was unreasonable to lockdown in February

However, on March 26, a person from Dorm B met a person from Dorm C at an non-essential construction site. The person from Dorm B passed the virus to the person from Dorm C. The residents of Dorm C thus became infected. In this case, had we locked down sometime earlier in March, we would have prevented the transmission of the virus from Dorm B to Dorm C.

Its not like all the dorms are next to each other, and its not like all dorms in Singapore are affected by this virus. An earlier lockdown would have prevented cross-spreading between different dormitories.

"COVID-19: Singapore confirms 219 new patients, with six community cases",,"> # COVID-19: Singapore confirms 219 new patients, with six community cases

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) preliminarily reported 219 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Friday (26 June) noon, bringing the total to 42,955.

> Of them, six are classified as community cases, while the remaining are foreign workers living in dormitories.

> “Based on our investigations so far, there are six cases in the community, of whom five are Singaporeans/permanent residents and one is a work-pass holder,” said the MOH.

> The ministry added that more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> This story will be updated later.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of 2,774 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge with 2,055 cases, Jurong Penjuru Dormitory with 1,809 cases, Cassia @ Penjuru with 1,474 cases and Tuas View Dormitory with 1,409 cases.

> These dorms, the top five clusters with the highest number of cases here, account for over 20 per cent of the total infected workers living in dorms. Some 400,000 such workers live in such residences here.

> The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Tuesday that 31 more dorms have been cleared of COVID-19: 27 factory-converted dormitories and four construction temporary quarters.

> Four blocks for recovered workers in three purpose-built dorms have also been cleared, the MOM added.

> This takes the total number to 163 dorms and 18 blocks for recovered workers in 11 purpose-built dorms cleared of COVID-19.

> As of Monday, about 79,000 foreign workers have been cleared of COVID-19, including those residing in government-provided accommodation facilities, said the MOM. Last week, a forecast of dormitories and blocks to be cleared from now till August onwards was published on the ministry’s website.

> With 305 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Wednesday, 36,604  cases – some 86 per cent of the total tally – have fully recovered from the infection.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while at least one is in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Thousands of patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 26 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, 11 others who tested positive for the virus were determined to have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and another four, including the 48-year-old male Indian national, whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> As of 15 June, the ministry has conducted 576,189 swab tests, of which 340,894 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 101,100 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 59,800 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

> Singapore entered Phase 2 of its reopening – with various safe distancing measures still in place – on 19 June. This phase is expected to last up to six months or longer, according to authorities.

> Singapore’s General Election will take place on 10 July during this phase.

At this moment, the UAE has 6500 cases, as has done about 770,000 test. They have tested 3 times more per capita than Singapore.  They also have a lot of migrant workers living in dorms. They are doing 23,000 test a day, almost 5 times Singapore's daily capacity.

Emirates Airline is also starting to introduce rapid test for all passengers

Round everyone up that is deemed 'high risk' i.e elderly, previous health concerns etc and invest in protecting those guys - round the clock care and isolation.  Let everyone else roam free and don't bother testing anyone.  Once the low risk, healthy people have herd immunity and recovered then allow the not so healthy people to come out.  Everyone will be under lock down anyway so no difference, but the healthy people can get businesses up and running and support those in need.  

The huge surge in cases that we're seeing in the dorms are clearly healthy guys with no symptoms at all, who would just recover naturally anyway.

"1,426 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore, mostly foreign workers in dormitories",,"At some point, the health ministry will stop moving out those who test positive, based on the educated suspicion that there will be more infected people than not. That's only simply because there is no manpower nor space to monitor tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of sick people.

To always keep things in context, covid is a very mild illness in the vast majority of people. We're experiencing manpower shortfalls in healthcare because of the (very justified) policy in isolating every person who tests positive - this is a vast manpower undertaking. But at some point - this policy will prove a logistical impossibility and will therefore be stopped. Anyone who falls very ill can then be transported to a healthcare facility, but otherwise, sick people will largely be left to their own devices.

With regard to long-term policies? A fact-finding committee should be set in place with the power to issue criminal charges. There must be an investigation into the practices of these dormitory operators, the actions (or lack thereof) of the political leadership, and if there has been undue influence of these shady businesses in the workings of our government. But that's not going to happen, of course.

The political leadership for too long has dallied on much-belated policies - it has been sitting on its arse for far too long leeching on the high-level of competence of the state bureaucracy. It's long-past time for them to tell local businesses to front up or shut up and stop crying about 'manpower shortages' because they don't want to pay living wages or invest in productivity automation. This foreign worker policy has long stunted the growth of the 'local core', and there is no safe way to house all of them without the politically impossible policy  (NIMBYs) of building a vast HDB new town.",2020-04-20 15:57:24

"1,426 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore, mostly foreign workers in dormitories",,"We've heard from Redditors in hospital diagnostics that testers are working shifts every day, without reduced staffing on Sundays.

However, because there's a noon cut-off for each day's numbers, I think the case numbers can fluctuate depending on whether a big batch of results comes out before or after the cut-off. So for example, 17/4 had only 623 cases, which was less than 728 the day before. But then 18/4 had 942. And yesterday had only 596, and today has 1426. 

It's like some days, they manage to get 2 batches of results in, but other days, they get 3 batches.",2020-04-20 19:55:42

No one can deny the cyclic pattern yet people insist that the trend is downwards. Most countries also report fewer cases and deaths on weekends (and sometimes Monday). I don't think this is due to lower testing capability, but rather delays in reporting. The decrease is probably less pronounced in Singapore due to a smaller backlog (if one exists).

No one knows the extent of infection in FWDs because the SARS-CoV-2 [**SCV2**] has already hit FWs at least 1 month ago under the radar of MOM which has been buried under the JSS & other various measures announced by Ah Heng’s 3 Budget speeches. 

As it is, this constantly mutating CoV [https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3080771/coronavirus-mutations-affect-deadliness-strains-chinese-study] has been infecting more FWs each day - the R° of SCV2 in FWD can be as high as 20 or more. 
*One bunk room in a FWD can house up to 20 beds*.

Note the particular vulnerability of farmed poultry to contract avian influenza from wild migratory bird; the infected farmed chickens and ducks can easily pass it to humans and the right mutation can make it jump human-human.

The general wisdom is that 
testing is important because asking people with mild symptoms just to stay home will lead to more infections in the household and community. If tested and positive, people can either be isolated in a facility (like in China/Vietnam) or put on strict home isolation (which they are more likely to adhere to if they know they have the virus for sure).

Things like relying on the biomedical/NCID expertise they've invested in etc - I thought they would but don't seem so. If keen, check out my profile for a comment where I summarised an infectious diseases control expert at NCID (speaking in personal capacity) who spoke at an online NUS Med webinar. There was quite a bit of evidence about asymptomatic transmission even back in Jan but Lawrence Wong said the govt only knew in April. So actions i thought were straightforward weren't taken. 

Other things I'd predicted (using POFMA but i didn't predict itd be abt Ho Ching's salary,  ploughing on with elections and not taking action earlier) came true.

 In short, anything to do with penalising the individual citizen was done swiftly. Anything to do with medicine wasn't.

But the point still stands. Even if SIV jumped to humans and mutated into HIV, in typical human tribal environments (where they eat bushmeat), the disease may just be confined to a single household, a clan, a few families, or a village before dying out. Even with 1920-1970 level of urbanisation and globalisation, a very difficult to transmit disease managed to become a pandemic (as in new, widespread).

I've lost count the number of times a dead animal corpse just lay there, being ran over with cars and who knows what bits and pieces of them are aerosolised and inhaled by me.

\- Migratory birds passing it to poultry herds that pass it to humans. Wet markets with live animals allows for infected animals to directly infect the end consumers, most likely living in dense urban areas. With more organised slaughter and meat packing, the farmers, butchers, and meat packers become ""disease sentinels"" for the rest of us. Should a nasty strain of avian influenza manage to jump to humans, there will be a chain of infections along the supply chain: the ""disease sentinels"". Hopefully, we catch that before the infected chickens reach the end consumer.

\- Rampant antibiotic use in Concentrated Animal Feed Operation = multi-drug resistant bacteria in meats going to the end consumer. Hospitals have to have MRSA-positive and negative wards to prevent cross-infection of staff and patients.

> Singaporeans have now learnt that operating mega dormitories for foreign workers is not a bad business at all (Rethink mega dorms beyond Covid-19 outbreak, May 14). For example, for the 2019 financial year, the net profits of Singapore Exchange-listed companies Centurion Corp, Wee Hur Holdings and Lian Beng Group from their dormitory and other businesses were $103.8 million, $34.9 million and $32.9 million, respectively.

> Singaporeans must therefore be puzzled as to why taxpayers will now be footing the bill for the increased operating costs incurred by such operators due to the dormitory lockdowns and stay-home notices (Govt to absorb added costs for dorm operators during circuit breaker, May 12).

> At a time when many deserving demands are competing for tight public finances, those who have profited for years from business models that have now come home to roost must not expect taxpayers to clean up after them.

This is on top of all the pay transparency issues within the industry (no time logs, no breakdowns of their pay, being give significantly less than what they were initially offered, not even being paid sometimes and when owed too much money the employer just pack and leave).

Arguments which commit the hasty generalization fallacy have the following structure:

A is a very small part of B
X is observed in A 
Therefore, 
Generalization X is made about B.

His argument is basically as follows:

1) To show our support for foreign workers, we must basically agree to pay more for everything.

2) Any (rightful) concern about higher prices is dismissed as an indicator that we are unwilling to help foreign workers. Which I find to be very disingenuous.

3) Some valid points are raised below. For one, we don’t how much of the costs are being passed to us. Might we even see a situation where we are charged $X more, but only a fraction of that ends up going to actually improving the living conditions of the FWs, while the construction companies end up pocketing the rest? Ie: not only are they not footing a portion of the cost as they should, they are going so far as to use this as an opportunity to further gouge the consumer and line their own pockets even more.

> Everyone in Singapore must be prepared to pay higher costs for construction work in Singapore due to Covid-19 safety measures, says Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong.

> Wong, who jointly heads the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on Covid-19 with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, said this in a press conference on Friday, May 15, referring to anticipated rises in cost associated with new measures that are being imposed on the construction industry as its workers return to work on critical projects.

> Testing scaled up, construction costs higher

> Wong said that the government intends to test all construction workers who are working every two weeks:

> ""(It) will scale up and we want to test all the workers who are working, who will be resuming work, and it will be done on a regular basis. This will be a new regulatory requirement on top of all the other safe distancing measures that we have put in place that we are talking about, that contractors will now have to uphold, so I have no doubt, as with all regulatory requirements, the principle must be that the company must bear the cost.""

> He added:

> ""So I have no doubt that it will mean construction costs in Singapore will be higher because of these regulatory requirements. And all of us have to be prepared to pay this higher cost, because we want construction work to be done safely in Singapore from henceforth.""

> Workers heading back to construction sites

> Also at the press conference, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) announced that an additional 20,000 construction workers, constituting about 5 per cent of the construction workforce in Singapore, will be returning to work from June 2 onwards.

> To ensure that all these workers remain healthy and Covid-19-free as far as possible, both large-scale and individual measures will be implemented.

> These include requiring each worker to download the TraceTogether app and wear a mask while working.

> At the worksites, workers must be divided into different teams, minimise interaction with other workers as much as possible, and the sites must also be equipped with sufficient hand wash stations and hand sanitisers.

> The workers must also have dedicated transport to and from their accommodations, if they are not able to live in quarters on-site, which will also be arranged to take into account safe distancing measures and to group workers involved in the same projects together.

And I don’t see any way around this, but money is really the solution to the problem. Mandate that workers need XXm2 amount of space, dorm operators charge out to developers, developers charge out to homeowners. You might say that uh, cant the developers just absorb the cost and cut profits. But that’s not how the market works right? And honestly, what can the government do about this? 

You might say that govt should pay, since they collect so much FW levy. But something has to go since govt has been using the FW levy to cross subsidise something else. So it’s either charge out to consumers or govt, i.e. taxpayers pay. 

And they decided that (as horrible as it is) they can get away with the living conditions as it is. Because on balance, that is better than making ppl pay more/raising taxes. honestly, most ppl didn’t care about FW pre-COVID.

Does no one have an issue with how the dormitory owners and construction industry seem to have largely gotten away scot-free? Over the years, they have made a small fortune by skimping on their living conditions. And these are not small companies barely breaking even. These are millionaires able to afford houses at Sentosa Cove, drive posh cars and otherwise lead lavish lifestyles. 

Meanwhile, when things go south, they don’t have to fork out a cent to clear up their shit. The government steps in to bail them out using taxpayer money, the opportunity cost of which is less resources to fund other social programmes for the betterment of society. And to add insult to injury, they still have the temerity to suggest that we foot the bulk of the added costs. 

Is this not akin to billing me for the bullet used to assassinate my loved one? 

My stance is, and always will be the same. I am willing to pay more, when I need to, for the betterment of society and the living standards of these foreign workers. I simply ask that the very people who have profited the most handsomely from their poor living conditions absorb the bulk of the costs, because they can, and because they should.

S'pore must be prepared to pay higher construction costs due to new Covid-19 regulations: Wong,,"Why would someone invest their money in a business that generates 10% profit margin instead of a business that generates 20% margin? 

Genuinely, would you invest in any sort of savings plan that gives less margin than another savings plan, all else being equal? 

You've not answered any of my questions on how this can be enforced when it comes to future constructions and developments. Yes the cost is distributed across society. How would the government enforce this cost? Increase levies and taxes against these construction and development companies? Create a price freeze that is pegged against some arbitrary or historical figure? On top of everything else, there are multiple parties involved. Dormitory owners, construction contractors, and property developers. If you force dormitory owners to absorb the cost of having more spacious lodgings and prohibit them from passing part or all of the additional cost to the construction contractor, then they will either take their money and go somewhere else, or convert their dormitories for more affluent clientele like foreign students, or pass on the cost to recruitment agents in the foreign worker's home countries, which are out of Singaporean jurisdiction. Or just charge the foreign workers more. The same sort of cycle will persist if you put the costs on the contractors, or the developers. 

If somehow these companies are able to be forced to absorb these costs and not pass them on to the consumer, then their P&L numbers go up, making them less attractive to investors, and the industry just doesn't grow. Without this growth, they will probably start cutting costs, beginning with poorer quality work or retrenchment of staff. So will they not be allowed to lay off staff as well?",2020-05-16 02:40:53

Like I said, who ends up bearing the brunt of this increased cost still remains to be seen, and until we know the exact breakdown, I reserve the right to be sceptical and concerned. 

And my response to you was not because of this point, but rather, your very fallacious argument about how any sort of perceived resistance to paying more was somehow indicative that we were only paying lip service to want to do more for foreign workers. 

Essentially trying to paint us as hypocrites. And that I take issue with. Not because I think there is any truth to it, but because I believe that an argument should not only be correct, but it should also be correct for the right reasons, and the dismissive manner in which you chose to respond is an affront to the rest trying to have a proper discussion, because you were basically attacking the arguer instead of the argument itself, and that, I cannot tolerate.",2020-05-15 22:59:10

wanting to help and being sincere in such a desire doesn't mean you help *blindly*. that's like saying donating to a charity that spends more resources proselytizing to people than actually helping beneficiaries is an exact equivalent of a charity that pours 90% of its resources into helping beneficiaries. you are imposing a false dicohotomy between helping sincerely and trying to demand for accountability from the other stakeholders who were involved and more directly so.",2020-05-16 01:56:03

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 344 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Saturday (6 June) noon, bringing the total to 37,527.

> Of them, the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories, said the ministry, while seven others are classified as cases in the community.

> “Based on our investigations so far, there are seven cases in the community, of whom three are Singaporeans/permanent residents and four are work pass holders,” it added.

> The ministry added that more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of over 2,700 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Jurong Penjuru Dormitory, and Tuas View Dormitory.

> The four are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some 400,000 such workers live in dorms here in Singapore.

> National Development Minister and co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce Lawrence Wong had at a 12 May press conference said that some 20,000 infected foreign workers are expected to be discharged by end-May.

> This story will be updated later.

> With 305 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, a total of 24,209 – over 60 per cent of total cases here – here have fully recovered from the infection, said the MOH on Friday.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while four are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Over 12,000 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 24 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, nine others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and two whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> As of 1 June, the ministry has conducted 408,495 swab tests, of which 264,393 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 71,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 46,400 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

> The MOH has been publishing a list of locations visited by cases in the community for over 30 minutes since last Monday.

> This list – which excludes residences, workplaces, healthcare facilities, and public transport – will be updated on a rolling 14-day basis or one incubation period, the ministry said.

> As a precautionary measure, the MOH advised those who had been at these locations during the specified timings to monitor their health closely for 14 days from their date of visit.

> They have also been urged by the ministry to visit the doctor if they develop symptoms such as cough, sore throat, as well as fever and loss of taste or smell, and inform the doctor of their exposure history.

"Opinion: Companies that are running the foreign worker dormitories should be the ones footing the bill for the treatment of the foreign workers, not the taxpayers.","I say when this is all over, we should send these companies the bill. Why? Because they caused it. There were many repeated warnings about how these dorms would be hotspots for spreading disease  way before the pandemic started. But these companies took the risk of squeezing foreign workers tightly so that they could make a bigger profit. They chose to take this risk, but when their gamble failed, suddenly it's the government and taxpayer who has to make all these costly arrangements. When the virus first hit our shores, they should have known that their dorms would be hotspots, and again they did nothing because it would have eaten into their profits.

A possible increase in the construction and maintenance cost (which will find its way to Singapore public in general) can be partially, or even completely offset from the current foreign worker levies that the government has been collecting.

The government is the biggest developer in singapore due to infrastructural contracts. They also run project awards on a lowest bidder wins structure. Some news reports here: [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/contractor-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/contractor-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116)

There are attempts to resolve this tho. But the underlying bidding structure is still lowest bidder wins. [https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/govt-to-place-greater-emphasis-on-quality-over-price-in-public-building-tenders](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/housing/govt-to-place-greater-emphasis-on-quality-over-price-in-public-building-tenders)

So, the company that can squeeze the most margin it can by cutting every possible corner legally tends to stay alive. Typically, such race to the bottom sort of competition would favor companies with deep pockets to out price everyone else (ride sharing, e commerce) and then consolidate as a major player with economies of scale. But we don't see it in construction instead of fighting for your single 10 minute cab ride or $30 dollar 2nd hand bid, they are fighting for million dollar projects that span years. The consolidation does occur with bankruptcies, but here's a list of all the companies that can bid for projects in singapore back in 2016: [https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/](https://jobabroadblog.wordpress.com/2016/04/16/list-of-construction-companies/) and they all exist in different tiers.

We could force the costs down their throats, say that workers require XYZ amount of space and living conditions. Where would the cost go? back to the construction project. If squeezing margin out from worker dorms isn't possible, it'd then be reflected back in bidders in the construction project bidding process, and back into the society. Sure, we'd ""fix"" one major sticking point here, but where would the margin come from still? corners cut from infrastructure? worker wages? more bankruptcies and consolidation which can take years to do? 

In the short term, sure, we can ""fine"" the companies and the dorm operators. Just remember that these dorms exist with BCA's full knowledge of them being in the conditions that they are. I don't think punishment is the way to go, but incentivizing innovation and progressive treatment is the better way forward. Both would cost the society, one in indirect manners via cut corners, higher building costs, and destructive bankruptcies and consolidation. The other is a direct cost that we can monitor and help push for a fundamental change in the industry for lower reliance on cheap replaceable labor, replacing them with more effective individuals that are highly skilled, and well paid.

FWIW, I've commented on this a few times:

For companies, these construction workers are expendable. They get injured in the workplace, they get shipped back to their home countries after patching them up. You think a fine + bills is a ""wake up call"". Nah, it's just a ""one-off expense"", ""we got caught fine"", basically a gamble for them. The calculations for them is such that they can mistreat them and still be in the green (cos you know, these events don't happen every year).

They will just gladly pay up and mistreat them again. And you know what? They won't follow, they will try to bend the rules further (like people who flout SHN/CB rules) and that will result in worse conditions for the workers. For instance, if a worker gets XYZ communicable disease (assuming it isn't hard to test like COVID-19), instead of reporting, they will just quickly ship that worker back to this hometown on the grounds of ""slacking off at work"". There, we mitigated the spread, absolutely nothing happened in our dorms! Bring in the next healthy batch of workers.

What we need isn't punitive punishment only (not saying that they shouldn't foot the bill). What we need is regulations and oversight. Which is why I feel, just like our HDBs, housing for them should be government run. That way, the government has control over it and we have indirect control over how the government treats them (e.g. making it a voter issue for pete's sake).",2020-04-14 00:46:43

About taxpayers' money being spent to treat the foreign workers, I think it's still going to be much lesser than the subsequent social and economic costs if the government did NOT intervene.

The last few weeks have shown that, no amount of appeals to common good is working... people just don't give a shit. Those who've run the dorms have been doing this years, and there's very little chance of them changing their ways, and if at all they do, there's a question of whether they'll do it fast enough.

Minister of State & Manpower stated 
> Mr Zaqy said conditions at the dormitory were found to be satisfactory when the last inspection was done on March 4.

So if ""shitty conditions"" can pass MOM inspection standards.

Question to be asked:

* Are amenities adequate for the workers to use?
* Is the inspection criteria stringent to ensure liveability? (Electrical, plumbing etc) Or the inspection was done half fuck?
* Problem of deplorable living conditions have already been around from initial -> current ""satisfactory"" conditions. Are the laws/ standards created to hit the bare minimum of the workers ""rights""? Social workers working with them have already mentioned these issues over many years.

[Source](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-conditions-at-punggol-dormitory-could-have-been-better-maintained-as-it-was-made)

Even if the workers fuck shit up in the dorms, isn't inspection meant to uncover these teething problems and reflect it to ministry & dormitory providers?

I see all these moves by the governing agency to move them out as a way to 

* Solve current ""satisfactory but deplorable"" conditions on paper
* Solve the now exploding increase of infection rate
* Sweep their crap way of handling treating of FW from the past till current under the rug (inspection criteria) 
* Acknowledge but don't apologize for past failings wrt. handling of the foreign workers situation

Ultimately, we as a society need to pay the price for the situation mentioned above. Prices of HDB have remained pretty cheap while cost of workers have increased over time. We as a society have also chosen to push them away from general population areas in fear of losing property value etc.

So, I think the comment is bit uninformed as the systems already are there to pay for most if not all costs said above. Very few of that costs will be coming to the tax payer.",2020-04-14 10:01:46

I'm a business owner and at some point of time, considered converting part of the factory to a dorm. The requirements are very much stricter than what OP has made it out to be. 

There are restrictions on how many beds you can put in a certain area, how many toilets per number of ppl, fire safety requirements, a sickbay separate from living qtrs must be planned, WiFi is compulsory, even entertainment is a must. These are all set out by big G not the dorm owners. Why will any dorm owner go beyond the basic requirement to make a loss? 

Most people will not believe it but the obscene environment is actually caused by the workers themselves. The best example is hanging clothes. By law, the dorm owner must specifically have an area just for hanging clothes because hanging clothes in your sleeping qtrs is asking for disease to spread but the workers would rather hang them in their own rooms for convenience. 

Many do not practice basic hygiene. My own employees said it was a living hell with bedbug infestations so we moved them out.

There's a limit to how much we can interfere with free market and more importantly, how nice should we treat the employees? Should the cost rise to 2-3k per employee? Our hdb and condo will be 3-4x more and nobody will be able to afford it. In other countries, bricklayers can be paid 5k a month. Will Singaporeans do it for 5k a month?

However it would become another cycle hidden away from us in the future when the foreign workers and their living conditions becomes forgotten and the companies decide to start exploiting loopholes in the systems.

Collectively I still feel such situations could have been overall avoided if not for the fact that singaporeans have become an entitled nation. The hard truth is that no one would do their work for the meagre salary. Theres also the hard labour that is not enticing under the hot sun or stifled conditions within construction. We should have been learning from examples like Australia, where they pay their labour workers well and a huge bulk of the hard labour jobs consists of their own people. This also creates a sense of pride within our community.

Going back to the main point, if we as a nation has been in such a situation where we dont rely on foreign workforce, the housing situation might not have happened and any form of exploitation would have been greatly reduced which in turns lead up to the fact that when a pandemic occurs, which is does throughout history, such a scenario we see unfolding would not have occurred.

It's easy to say that the company could've provided solution. But solution cost money and who's footing the bill.

DOs usually does some form of optimization just like hospitals and hotels. What are the demands? How do we balance between quality and cost. I believe that you wouldn't expect DOs to operate at a loss unless they're doing charity and expected to make some profit.

Say that I open a dormitory with better facilities, everyone gets more space and place is cleaned regularly and better than others. Do you think that I will be capable of charging the same amount as what the other, lousier dormitories are charging?

Lemma: If I'm chosing a dormitory, would I pick a dormitory with poorer condition at the same price? Would DOs that charge exorbitant amount for poor condition survive? Those on the news are unsurprisingly cheaper than the rest in general.

Then you might say that, why not just set a requirement to make the conditions better. Then again who is paying for it? If it is no longer attractive to operate or invest in operating dormitories, how do we get people to do it? If the cost increases, are the workers suppose to pay for the increase? Or are the employers expected to absorb the fee? Or will the employers pass on the cost to their customers. And we have another recurring problem.

Then how are we going to ensure that cost of housing and maintenance does not increase if the cost is passed on the employers? How are we going to help those whos affected by this change?

I think that this is an issue that isn't as simple as you think it is honestly.",2020-04-14 14:02:09

From a game-theoretic standpoint, if all other firms are housing workers using the lowest-cost method possible, then as an individual firm you can't hope to survive in the long run while still giving workers more living space and taking more safety precautions. And even if all the dorm operators willingly go above and beyond the minimum safety regulations, everyone has an incentive to deviate and squeeze more workers into one room. So there's something like a prisoner's dilemma and the point of failure here is really regulation, not individual firms.

You could argue that by making dorm operators bear the cost of treatment, they will internalise the costs and risks involved in squeezing so many workers into one space. But the social costs of a pandemic are way higher than the private costs of treatment: you're making them pay for the cost of treating each infected individual but you're not making them pay for the cost of them spreading the virus to others. So in equilibrium you'll still see not enough precautions being taken. And I would argue that with black swan events like a pandemic that happen so infrequently and have so many unknown unknowns, even if you impose a fine for each infected case that truly reflects the social cost of the pandemic, I don't think it is realistic to think that this will induce dorm operators to take the right precautions.",2020-04-14 17:00:36

Too many Singaporeans ignore the economics of the situation.

People seem to think that companies can set whatever price they want for their projects. They can't - there's a market price due to competition.

The other objection I see often is that companies can just spend a little more on better dormitories and make a less profit as the ""moral"" thing to do. Again it's not that simple. Cash will flow to projects and companies with better profit margins. Post smaller margins than your competitors? Banks will be less likely to finance your projects and investors will be less likely to invest in your company. Less projects and less profits also means talent will slowly start ebbing out of the company. It's a slow spiral to the death of a company.

We need to be careful with this as well, otherwise the costs for the better dorms will be passed to the workers. A majority of them won't want this - they just want to do their time, earn enough, and leave as soon as possible.",2020-04-14 10:13:57

A couple if not more bunk beds in a room, depending on room size with shared living area.

They aren't living in inhuman conditions. I doubt they will be fined except for if safe distancing law applies to the dorm supervisors. The place where I can see fines being imposed are just that, and failure to upkeep hygiene standards by supervisors. I've heard about electrical issues as well. HUGE FINES like people are hoping for probably won't happen.

If it all adds up it might be substantial, but nothing big enough to invoke waves of change. Stricter supervision will become a thing, but I doubt they will suddenly be living in better homes. While living conditions were not stellar, they were livable. There were no major issues prior to Covid. So the majority of this outrage is stemming from *distancing issues.*

In case the economics have failed the majority of Reddit, the biggest problem that plagued most people in Singapore financially is housing, before this Covid crisis. This is a problem of landspace. 100 HDB flats isn't suddenly going to appear out of no where, and 6 fully grown adults in one flat isn't exactly a huge step up. The biggest improvements here will be not having to bath with everyone. But that doesn't solve much does it? We would need 200-300 HDB flats to really allow safe distancing permanently. That's 200-300 high rise 40 floors hdb. 

Anyone has any idea where you wanna build 100-300 high rise HDB in Singapore to solve safe distancing for foreign workers permanently? Do the math yourself, there are roughly 300k foreign construction workers in Singapore at any one time. 

Or, you know, we could make foreign workers live in coffin homes like in Hong Kong. Way more inhuman IMO, but hey, safe distancing and privacy won't be an issue there. Perfect for dealing with covid, agreed?

If anyone of you can solve these issues, and compile the math and financial budget required for any minister to undertake this task, be my guest. I'd love to see these workers living in good condition too. But personally I think it's a more concrete issue of budget than a philosophical issue of discrimination and lack of care.",2020-04-14 06:27:50

We can't simply blame the dorms since the regulations themselves don't call for higher standards.

>She noted that before such purpose-built dorms were constructed, many foreign workers lived in poor and unhygienic conditions, and a decision was taken to build the current dorms to raise standards.  
>  
>Today's dorms have proper sleeping rooms with beds, dedicated toilet and shower facilities, recreational spaces with TVs and newspapers, supermarkets or minimarts, and dedicated sick bays.  
>  
>They are licensed under the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act and must meet conditions including cleanliness, water supply, sanitation and hygiene of premises.  
>  
>Ministry of Manpower (MOM) officers conduct regular inspections to ensure standards are adhered to, and take strong enforcement action against operators that provide poor accommodation.  
>  
>""Occasionally, I get complaints that my officers were 'high-handed' during enforcement, when they are just doing their jobs in the workers' interests,"" said Mrs Teo.

There is no doubt the standard should be raised, but it's more of an issue between MOM and Employers, not dorms.

I don't have issues with the size per room. I have stayed before. But I do with two things, the maintenance and the size of dorm.

The size is fixed by the MOM guidelines of certain sqft per pax. Not the most comfortable but they are just cheap accommodation. For the maintenance, I know and I've seen how sloppy it can get. On facilities and all. Yes, I think they should be subjected to fines for that.

Size of dorm, now this will fall under regulations which have to be changed to restrict mega dorms from happening again.",2020-04-14 07:50:16

Singaporeans demand for a distinction between locals and foreigners. Otherwise, why have a citizenship? Also, these dorms are not the best, because these workers are meant to be transient. 

What is required is basic standards to be met. They are not living in inhuman/ cruel conditions. Their basic needs are met. Emphasis is on ""basic"" - nothing more. 

Seen the pictures of MOM approved dorms online. Yes, some dorms are a bit messy and look cluttered; but area wise, it is comparable to our NS dormitories. 

IF our SAF soldiers and NSFs can stay in such ""inhuman"" bunks, why can't our foreign workers? The complaint, rather should be - maybe we should be making the dorm operators enforce some level of discipline. Maybe more ""stand by area"" and ""area cleaning"". Or hire more cleaners.

Don't forgot that if you actually read the regulations, you will see that it is mandated by law for every dorm to have common areas for recreation; rooms to hang their clothes; sick bays and even wifi.

That if we can't do the math, let's allow a bunch of poor/brown people to live in inhumane conditions, and maybe suffer and die?

Any business or government that cannot ensure humane conditions for all should fall. It's as simple as that. If it requires a period of a lowered standard of living which is still humane, then so be it.

Don't accidentally imply that some human beings should suffer and die while others live on comfortably. I'm afraid that would accidentally align you with the fascists of the world.

1. Do we need that many foreign workers in the first place? We know that our construction companies are very low-tech when compared to developed nations because foreign labour here is still considered way too cheap. Why buy a bulldozer when I can hire 10 FWs to do the same job with hammers? Even the govt has been trying to persuade these companies to tech-up with no result. So there is still space to reduce the number of workers while still maintaining the same output. 
2. Do we really lack space? Some of the bosses of these dorms own a couple of landed properties for themselves both in and out of Sentosa. Maybe its time to consider a more utilitarian approach to the use of our land. If we are so land-scarce as you say, then why allow people to own more property than they need? 
3. Lastly, why must the solution fall on us? Govt sets the law and the market should be left with its own devices to come up with solutions. That is the beauty of capitalism. Maybe if we had more stringent regulations on FW housing then companies will finally trade in hiring worker en masse to buying technology.",2020-04-14 14:39:32

Literal tax paying citizens of Hong Kong lives in more inhumane conditions. Did you even read what I wrote? 

Living in a dormitory cluster is not inhumane. We are not throwing them into the slums where people have to literally live surrounded by their own waste with no readily available source of water or sanitary toilets. 

Just what kind of living conditions do you believe FW dorms to be?

They won't die if covid did not exist, and more people are dying per capita from covid in the United States than foreign workers.

If you are using deaths from covid as a statistic, the citizens of the United States has less livable condition than foreign workers in Singapore. If you are saying people are dying because of the living condition, bring up evidence, because as far as I can tell, nothing has even come close to being negligent enough to cause death. 

Most if not all foreign worker death comes from workplace accidents.

Clearly that's not an accurate way to measure living conditions.

They live in humane conditions. Living in a bunk setting is far from inhumane. Amenities are provided to ensure they are living in humane condition. 

In the right time living next to a volcano provide fertile land, in the wrong time living next to a volcano is a death trap.

No, math is not so important that if you don't know math people should die.

Give some actual level of research if you want to make a proposal that upgrading tech will significantly reduce the need for foreign workers.

How many skilled workers are needed to operate the vehicle, what is the lump-sum cost of investment and what is the upkeep cost? How much can you save with this technological upgrade that will eliminate maybe half of foreign worker workforce? How much training is necessary and how long will it take to implement?

""Just upgrade lah"" is something you hear too often from ignorant bosses and ignorant masses. It provides absolutely zero solution, and zero steps towards the solution. Ideas are cheap, execution is everything.

2) I can agree with this. However, you talk about capitalism in your third point. Don't allow the successful to have landed property, lose the successful. This disgusting world you are living in is controlled by the 1%.

Then again, how much landed space do you really think that will clear up?  I don't think that shit will be the solution to this problem here.

3) You don't need to solve the problem, but unless you actually tried to tackle the problem you don't understand why this is a problem that's so damned hard to solve. Logistic is everything. Your ""maybe"" doesn't actually do anything. What is to say that they won't just make things unnecessarily harder on FW?

If  the govt is doing the work in coming up with ideas and solutions to keep construction companies profitable, then is it really capitalism? Might as well keep the profits for ourselves then. The solution on our end is just set the minimum requirements, then let the market decide for themselves how they want to work things out. Its the same with other forms of regulations we have. Take the example of internet banking that is happening right now. Govt sets the minimum requirements and the private sector competes with each other for the license and figures it out for themselves how to get it done. We dont have to go into detail to tell them how to do it. You want government to provide them with programmers and coders and customer support staff? No. You set the floor, and let the companies do the work. That's the point of capitalism.

And if it ends up making things harder for the FW, then we adjust and try again. Policy is always open-ended in that sense.

Edit: Speaking of economics, the pertinent problem here is that  these companies are causing a negative externality in the form of higher spread of disease.

Like I said, I don't believe in capitalism. Negative externalities will never be covered by the market, are you insane? How much compromised rivers and seas polluted by waste and natural water resources occupied by private enterprise do you need before you realize government intervention is needed to mitigate that shit?

Your entire argument boils down to this: prodding the market will fix it.

You are underestimating the shithole the market is.

3) Again I think you're being dumb. You back yourself into a corner if you criticise coal but provide zero alternatives. What do you do when asked so what? You just tell them to have the market find alternative for you. Meanwhile the market is doing everything in their power to fund the notion that coal is a necessary evil through fudged bias studies, and that coal isn't that bad. 

That is not true. It's because of extremely convincing proposals that alternatives are viable and the cost will be lowered that countries adopted a different policy.

This time bomb has now exploded but we've known about the deplorable conditions and attitudes towards foreign workers for a long time - it was a error of commission, not ommission, in allowing the problem to fester. After this is resolved, we should not let a good crisis go to waste - let's amplify the voices pushing for positive change, let's uplevel our values, and let's hold our leaders to account.

> SINGAPORE - Singapore saw a sharp spike of 287 coronavirus cases on Thursday (April 9), with the majority linked to foreign worker dormitories.

> This is the highest daily number reported to date and brings the total number of cases here to 1,910, as the global number of cases crossed the 1.5 million mark.

> Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean is now advising the multi-ministry taskforce on handling the Covid-19 situation in foreign worker dormitories, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, noting that the police and Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) are involved in operations there.

> To cut the chain of transmission in dormitories, thousands of foreign workers who are healthy - especially those working in essential services - will be moved to army camps, floating hotels, and vacant Housing Board blocks.

> Singapore has also started active case finding and is swab-testing workers in various dormitories, said the Health Ministry's (MOH) director of medical services Kenneth Mak at a press conference on Thursday.

> Preliminary investigations have linked the cluster at Mustafa Centre with clusters at the construction site at Project Glory and five dormitories.

> Associate Professor Mak said the ministry believes that foreign workers had visited Mustafa Centre, where some employees had fallen ill, and gotten infected there.

> They then transmitted the infection to their co-workers, who subsequently infected others at their dormitories.

> ""Many had very mild symptoms and so they continued to work, that's why there was a delay in picking them up,"" said Mr Wong, who chairs the ministerial task force along with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong. It is likely that the virus had been spreading in dormitories for some time, he said.

> 

> Mr Wong said Singapore is dealing with two separate infection spreads.

> In foreign worker dormitories, numbers are rising sharply, he noted. But in the wider community, numbers are more stable.

> ""This is a major and urgent issue that requires active intervention,"" he said. ""That is why we decided to put in more resources and set up a dedicated task force focusing on dorms.""

> On Tuesday, the Manpower Ministry (MOM) had announced the formation of an inter-agency task force to provide support to foreign workers and dormitory operators.

> The task force will ensure the well-being of workers and improve their living conditions by supporting dormitory operators as they implement ""circuit-breaker"" measures.

> MOM is supported by the Ministry of Health, National Environment Agency, the SAF, the Singapore Police Force, Migrant Workers' Centre and other agencies.

> Explaining the Government's decision to set up a task force, Mr Wong said: ""We cannot rely solely on dorm operators any more, given the current situation.""

> Manpower Minister Josephine Teo noted that there has been no cluster in dormitories until recently, even though a number of foreign workers have tested positive for the virus.

> ""Bear in mind that dorms are home to foreign workers,"" she added. ""Within dorms workers interact with each other very regularly, very closely, they're like family, so the risk of transmission was always there.""

> Workers will now not be able to prepare their own meals, to reduce human contact, and cleanliness and hygiene have been stepped up. Existing sick bays will also be scaled up to take care of workers that need to be isolated.

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that despite circuit breaker measures kicking in on Tuesday, social gatherings are still taking place. More than 10,000 written advisories have been issued over the past two days to those who did not observe safe distancing.

> ""This cannot continue,"" he said.

> Mr Wong added that enforcement efforts will be stepped up against those who continue to flout safe-distancing measures.

> ""We hope Singaporeans will comply not just because of enforcement efforts but really out of a necessity for all of us to do our part,"" he said.

Isn't this a convoluted reasoning? You are looking at it specifically from a time frame whereby it augments your statement.

ie There is community spread. The community spread has ALREADY reach the dormitory. Therefore an earlier lockdown, regardless, will still spread among the dormitory resulting in huge case numbers because of the conditions. Basically the only way for your statement to be true, you need a first spark to start the fire.

However, when ppl are talking about earlier lockdown, ppl meant it as a whole, to even prevent community spread(dormitory being an ideal hotspot does not equate to the virus will travel there by themselves) . Unless you are suggesting that an earlier lockdown WILL still result in spread because erm... magic? Because Taiwan definitely manage to prevent community spread by acting earlier.

I'm not going to delve into army culture but expecting basic respect and decency from your employer and host is justified. Your comment has a bit of, ""Ah ok, but what about me???"" sentiment.

You state that it's hard to maintain and order when trying to implement measures on FW and that it is the more practical way to enforce measures but again, that doesn't mean it's right to do so. I'd even argue that you are making many assumptions about FW and are underestimating their capicity to understand. Fuck off with practicality la, again, they are NOT CATTLE. 

And how is your last paragraph about Singapore being 'the best place to be' in any way related to how they are being treated? Unrelated comment that seems to be justifying the callous treatment they are receiving. 

Look, in the end of the day, NSF and FW are from totally different socio-economic situations. NSF can go back home to their mummy/daddy/maid/girlfriend/boyfriend easily, FW don't have that luxury and have to juggle the pressure of sending back enough money back home to their families.

"Record 287 new Covid-19 cases in S'pore, links found between Mustafa Centre and clusters in foreign worker dormitories",,"Ok first of I'd like to say that I'm not intentionally being edgy. And I'm fine with using my real name because I haven't said anything that I'm ashamed of, and if anyone tries to doxx me, they automatically lose all moral high ground. Let me rephrase what I'm trying to say here: the workers should be given the best possible conditions that we can afford. Key phrase: that we can afford. And when I say ""take office first"", I don't literally mean that you have to assume an official position in order to try and enact change, I'm asking you to look at it from a different perspective. It's very easy to criticise but if you were actually there on the ground trying to recruit volunteers, distribute medical supplies, and relocate healthcare workers, I think you would better appreciate what is already being done. I'm not saying it's perfect, not by a long shot, but I'm saying that I trust the government is doing all that it can within a reasonable capacity. I do agree that there are and will continue to be flaws, lapses and slip-ups, but I also trust that such issues will be addressed in the fastest and best possible way. I mean already in that article it outlined how efforts were being made to improve living conditions: ""cleanliness and hygiene being stepped up""', ""sickbays being scaled up"", ""thousands of workers moving to army camps, floating hotels and empty HDBs"" to ease up on the cramped conditions... I mean it doesn't really sound a lot like Omelas to me, sounds like they're actually trying hard to make it better.

Second point about hierarchy. I maintain that the Singpore government's first priority rightfully is, and always should be, Singaporean nationals. Does this mean that we should simply neglect everyone else and leave them to die in crowded conditions? Of course not! But consider if we quarantined all 20,000 workers identically to how we have been quarantining our own citizens. Our systems would be completely overwhelmed in no time. It would leave no margin whatsoever for future infections, many of whom would be nationals. If we had the space and the resources then of course they should give workers the same conditions, but sadly this isn't the case. I just want to put across the point that when we have such limited resources, no matter what couse of action you take there is always going to be someone who loses out.

Okay, as for the bit where you said this isn't just for the government, it's for everyone, I agree with you almost completely. However, it is incredibly difficult to see any kind of change coming about in the immediate future. And frankly, you should be the change that you want to see. If you're really passionate about this, then you should volunteer to cook/clean for the workers. You might say, ""oh I'm busy, I still have to work from home, etc etc"", all of which is perfectly understandable. Then maybe you should consider that this is the same situatiom which other Singaporeans are in. Now again, I'm not saying, ""you must be a volunteer, then only you can talk about how people should be more sympathetic"", I'm just saying that if everyone expressed concern online but never enacted any real change, people would be a lot more caring for our workers but the actual workers' situations would not improve.",2020-04-10 10:39:08

> SINGAPORE: The Government will construct new foreign worker dormitories as part of plans to reduce the current density in these accommodations.

> 

> By the end of this year, the authorities will create additional space to house about 60,000 workers, the Ministry of National Development (MND) and the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in a joint media release on Monday (Jun 1).

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> These include Quick Build Dormitories (QBDs) that can be constructed “quite quickly” in a modular form with a low density. These QBDs can last for about two to three years and can house about 25,000 people in total.

> Eight sites have been earmarked for new QBDs by the end of 2020, including in Kranji, Tuas, Admiralty, Choa Chu Kang and Tampines.

> 

> Unused state properties, including former schools and vacant factories, will be fitted out temporarily to house about 25,000 workers, and the authorities are talking to contractors to build more construction temporary quarters, which are makeshift dormitories that keep the workers near their worksite.

> 

> Some of the state properties that will be refurbished include the former Bedok North Secondary School building, the former Anderson Junior College Hostel and tents at the National Service Resort and country club in Kranji.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> As part of longer-term plans, the Government is planning to build new purpose-built dormitories (PBDs) over the next few years that can house up to 100,000 workers. These dormitories, which will have amenities such as minimarts and barber services, will replace the temporary accommodations built this year.

> 

> About 11 PBDs will be ready in the next ""one to two years"", the media release said. Workers living in the PBDs will also have ready access to medical care and support.

> 

> ""With these additional PBDs in place, we will also have the capacity to decant

> workers from the existing dormitories, and to undertake major upgrading to these

> dormitories to ensure that they meet the new standards,"" the ministries said.

> Besides expanding housing availability for foreign workers, government agencies are developing a set of specifications for these new dormitories, the ministries added.

> 

> These specifications will look into the design, facilities, management and regulation of these dormitories, and will factor in social interaction and disease response needs.

> 

> “In land scarce Singapore, dormitories are a practical approach to housing our migrant workers,” the media release said.

> 

> “We aim to make dormitory living and design more resilient to public health risks including pandemics, with improved living standards that are benchmarked both domestically and internationally.

> 

> “We will take on board lessons learnt from the current COVID pandemic, and also seek feedback from relevant stakeholders.”

> 

> Some of the present set of standards that will be improved as part of a pilot include increasing the living space per resident from a minimum of 4.5 sqm per resident, including shared facilities, to at least 6 sqm, not including shared facilities.

> 

> There will also be a maximum occupancy rate of up to 10 beds per room. Currently, there are no limits - the ministries noted that in practice, there are about 12-16 beds in each room.

> 

> The new set of requirements will see only single-deck beds being used, with 1m spacing between the beds.

> More toilets and bathrooms will also be built so that there is at least one bathroom, sink and toilet for every five beds, instead of every 15 beds.

> 

> The Government is also studying the possibility of developing the new PBDs on a different model compared to the present system, where currently land is released for the commercial operators to bid, build or operate.

> 

> ""While the physical standards are being improved, it is equally important to uplift the capabilities of dormitory operators and make adjustments to the daily living habits of the dormitory residents,"" the ministries said.

> ""Everyone must do their part to minimise the risk of infection clusters. The pilot will therefore also seek to instil a new level of discipline on safe living within dormitories.""

> The ministries noted that cost will go up alongside these new housing arrangements, “but they will keep the workers safe and allow Singaporeans to continue benefiting from their contributions"".

>

I believe that this is the only realistic path seeing that reducing the number of people will reduce the strain on the common facilities (toilets, shower area etc etc), and reduce the amount of dirt being brought in from their work sites. There are also arguments that the reason that dorms are in their bad states is also partially due to their own habits and culture where what they consider as ""clean"" might not be ""clean"" to Singaporean standards. 

To combat this, relocating them to less dense dorms seems to be most logical sense in improving their living conditions. Less strain on the common facilities, easier to clean up due to the reduce in dirt/soil being brought from their sites.",2020-06-02 10:23:06

"COVID-19: Singapore to build new dormitories, improve living conditions for migrant workers",,"One possible way is to reduce the reliance on foreign workers. Of course the counter argument is that it is easier said than done. I agree that certain field like the construction field require more manual labour etc and yes we definitely need foreign workers to contribute to our economy. However, do we need such a huge amount of them ? Or are they here because corporations want them here to maximise their profits ?  When we were in the early 2000s they were here mainly for construction and S&CC services. However, more and more came to roles such as building maintenance and marine services. I believe some Singaporeans would be willing to take on such roles if not for the otherwise poor salary given as corporations wants to keep their expenses low to maximise profits and the easier option is to choose the foreign worker option.

In the view of improving living conditions, it might be necessary to build more dormitories but they could still be built at areas where the population doesn’t resides. If we have to settle them at offshore facilities or floating dormitories then so be it. Also, cleanliness of shared areas could be enforced. I wouldn’t dare to make the assumption that their living spaces is same as what the SAF provides but I would dare to say that it is at least comparable. Why are shared areas and living spaces in bunks way better than what the FWs are living in ? I think it boils down to discipline. Some SAF bunks have 8 double decker beds in a single room and yet the area is still clean af. The question is, are they committed to clean up after their own? It doesn’t matter how much space we give them at the end of the day. If they don’t bother to give a fuck about their own area, no one can help them isn’t it ?",2020-06-02 11:08:17

There is no way Singaporeans would want to do the job that the FW who lives in dorms do (construction, grass cutting, road resurfacing 6 times a week etc etc)

For your second point, yes I believe that culture and mindset does play a part in the current condition of the dorms. However, there is also so much ""trash"" (for a lack of better word ) a person can create. By reducing the number of people, it brings down the total amount of ""trash"", making it easier to clean up (or cleaners to clean if they contracted any).

"COVID-19: Singapore to build new dormitories, improve living conditions for migrant workers",,"Didn't need proof, lol. It was inevitable. 

Society is a hot mess of discombobulating, incoherent and inconsistent ideas. And the bottom line is everyone has a voice, everyone is able to influence the outcome. It's simultaneously empowering and discouraging. 

Back in 2011, the influx of foreign labour was the, if not one of the largest, election issue. It cost the PAP a talented Foreign Minister (oh - and a GRC. Whatever). Since 2011 you can track a very clear and blunt shift in policy, focused on keeping FWs away from the public eye. The Little India Riots didn't help, and the public furor only cemented the policy turn as being the right thing to do (if only to avoid public outrage). 

Now, one can persist in laying that at the feet of the PAP, saying that's the PAP abdicating moral responsibility, etc. But another can also make the argument that the PAP was simply following their democratic mandate and listening to the people. *I find it very hard to accept any denial that the voters back in 2011 had a hand in creating the standard of living that FWs experience now*.  

Consequently, while I applauded the outpouring of goodwill to the FWs in the Covid saga, the inevitable pushback was inevitable. Because society is a hot mess. 

My response above was to the comment that we can simply ignore these people, that their views are inconsequential because they're ""wrong"". No. We can't. That's not how democracy works. They will have their voice. There will be an opposition party who will, under the temptation of quick and easy votes, champion their cause. And if none of the existing opposition parties are stupid enough to take up that flag, the likelihood of them creating their own opposition party to raise that voice only increases. 

It is inevitable. The only way we have forward is to continue to show that they are a misguided minority in our society, and their views do not hold water in dictating how the country decides to treat FWs.",2020-06-02 15:17:48

Many people say that the government should have made mask wearing mandatory earlier. Thing is, Singapore didn't have any factories of its own until February, and the countries it sourced masks from banned exports. (EDIT: Plus, while Singapore does have its own stockpile for healthcare workers, if the government were to provide everyone with surgical masks, they'd probably run out in a matter of weeks, if not days.) So at the time, it made perfect sense not to wear masks.

And also, regarding the situation in dorms: that was in large part due to a superspreading event at Mustafa Centre. 2 imported cases there eventually infected 80+ cases, many of which were migrant workers, who would later bring it into their dorms. And since the workers live communally, once 1 case was detected (a couple days after infection mind you) it'd've been almost impossible to stop. The government for their part did a total lockdown of dorms about a week after their first case. 

While there is room for improvement, the actions they took were understandable.

EDIT: Adding on, I don't quite agree with the narrative that the government ignored migrant workers - they stopped mass assemblies and staggered usage of communal facilities as early as [mid-February.](https://www.mom.gov.sg/newsroom/press-releases/2020/0210-mom-issues-updated-advisory-on-enhanced-precautionary-measure-for-dormitory)",2020-05-30 17:30:14

I should probably have posted this on r/asksingapore in hindsight, though I don't see getting any upvotes either way - this post was purely for discussion anyway, controversial as it might be!","To quote Yong Han Poh in her facebook post (that was well written and linked to two other interesting opinions on this matter which I unfortunately can't link to because this subreddit doesn't allow for Facebook links):

""I don’t agree with many things in Dr. Tan’s post, but that doesn’t mean I fully agree with Dr. Leong’s post either.

On the first two points, yes, I understand that there are numerous policy considerations and the apparent “U-turn” came because of a mix of changing epidemiology and strategic / security concerns relating to mask supply and so forth. Like Dr. Leong, I don’t blame the government for revising their policies given changing circumstances. I also think we have remarkable testing capacity, and I don’t doubt that many contingency plans have been put in place to avoid over-straining our healthcare system. On these fronts, I applaud the government.

It’s really his third point that I want to critique. Dr. Leong says that his ""hypothesis is that the real root cause for the foreign dorm infections was the humongous number of asymptomatic cases.” He even throws in a thought experiment: “Suppose the Government has just listened to these NGOs. Every single one of these foreigner workers had their own single rooms with attached bathroom and sauna. Best in Singapore and Batam also. We throw in a cleaning auntie to do area cleaning for them and do their laundry. Just imagine that. Do we believe that it would have allowed us to avoid the current problem with the foreign worker dorms? Obviously, this would increase social distancing and *maybe* help somewhat. But guess what? The workers will still be eating together and working together. Do people understand how infectious this virus is? Even healthcare workers in full PPE can still catch it. Confirm will still kenna. Who are we kidding?” 

What is the counter-factual here? I recognize neither of us have any data, but since Dr. Leong uses a thought experiment to make his assertion, I’m going to use his logic to illustrate my own speculations. Imagine that migrant workers lived six people to a room (don’t need single room lah horh), attached with their own kitchen and toilets (don’t need sauna also). When Covid hit (and when everyone has been ordered to stop working because of CB), they are able to practice social distancing, and cook for themselves in their own kitchens. They don’t have to be cramped - sometimes thirty-five people to a room - trying to practice social distancing, or rely on MOM to provide them food (dorms typically only have communal kitchens, and some dorms / FCDs don’t have kitchens at all).  I think this could have help stemmed the rapid transmission rates, even if some transmission was still inevitable because of asymptomatic carriers, as Dr. Leong pointed out. The difficulties of practicing social distancing in these dorms and warnings of a possible contagion have been sounded out as early as February by healthcare professionals such as Dr. Jeremy Lim, and echoed again by migrant groups like Geylang Adventures and TWC2. Why weren’t they heeded? This is what I would like to know, and hopefully there will be a Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry convened post-crisis to explore this, and highlight the government’s own considerations and practical constraints for the public. (And if the government already knew it was so infectious, why did it take them so long to commit to distributing free reusable masks and sanitizers for the migrant workers?) 

Dr. Leong also writes, ""I think it’s despicable for these groups to try to use this crisis to advance their lobbying. This is not the time.” I normally try to avoid emotive language in such discussions, but since you used the word, I think it is “despicable"" to accuse NGOs for being opportunistic or having an agenda. By definition, the mission of these NGOs and advocacy groups /is/ to advocate for better migrant rights. What do you want them to do - remain silent amidst a by the way, /national/ crisis? So it’s okay for them to lobby for better rights for migrant workers before Covid but not during? What about the fact that actually, Singapore is having a national conversation about migrant worker policy post-crisis now, and that their voices, together with those of migrant workers’, are very important in helping to shape that? 

Dr Leong also criticizes big mouths for having ""no sense of perspective, no sense of the costs and no sense of the practical constraints.”  This may be fair. Of course everything entails trade-offs. But I don’t think we should fault NGOs or advocacy groups or whichever “big mouths” you might be alluding to for clamouring for migrant rights or better dormitory conditions, even if you find them utopian. The job of the policymaker is to try and achieve “balance” and negotiate between somtimes competing interests and translate utopian ideals into realistic policy. The job of the advocate is to try and push the boundaries of what is possible, to shift mindsets that everything is a cost-based calculation, to introduce rights-based language into public discourse, and to push for a human-centered approach in policy-making. Everyone has a different part to play in the ecosystem. The policy maker has the unglamorous (and sadly, thankless) job of deciding how best to navigate those practical constraints, and what kinds of costs are reasonable. But this is not just an empirical question - it is also a normative one - and it is precisely the normative aspect that these “big mouths” are speaking to, by making us as a public reflect on the principles by which we arrive at these answers in the first place. 
 
Finally, Dr. Leong calls for us to “have a sense of perspective”. He writes, “We are not the only country to have massive numbers of foreign or migrant workers. I don’t believe that the living conditions of our foreigner workers are the worst in the world. Other countries have no COVID infections in their dorms or dorm-equivalents we think? Are people so naive? Note that as far as I know, we are the *only* country, where the PM has appeared on national TV to assure the foreign workers. To tell them, not worry, Singapore will take care of them. Think about that for a moment.”

I’m having trouble fully distinguishing between ""having perspective"" and outright “whataboutism”. It is true that many other countries struggle with Covid infections in their dorm equivalents, and Singapore certainly isn’t the worst in the world. But this doesn’t make the current situation right, or absolve the G of responsibility, even if it does seem to make these failings appear reasonable. We can, and should, aspire to better. I don’t think the G has done terribly on these counts, but it doesn’t mean I think they have done brilliantly either. The PM has appeared on national TV to assure the foreign workers - great. But let’s not conflate these reassurances post-crisis with Singapore’s treatment of migrant workers more generally, and let us not forget the hard work of NGOs and advocacy groups who have been crucial in pushing for more migrant worker protections both before and during this crisis. 

Of course, to quote Dr. Leong, “Don’t just believe what people tell you. Heck, don’t even believe me. Derive everything again by yourself from first principles”. Don’t believe me either. And unlike Dr. Tan and Dr. Leong, I don't have a PhD in anything and certainly don’t claim expertise - these are just my personal thoughts as a humble citizen.""",2020-05-31 06:03:09

If the govt initially told people there's no need to wear masks due to fear of panic-buying of masks, then it does make sense why they would say that. Not that it excuses them from preparing a readily-available supply of masks for an epidemic, but I could see why they did it regardless.

The dorm situation coming about due to a super-spreading is understandable as well. Nevertheless, when criticising the govt, many commenters here are pointing out the lack of preparation on the FW dorms to prevent spread of infectious diseases as a whole. They did a lockdown in the end, so at least they did something even if it was a little too late. Seems to be a case of lack of foresight rather than malevolence.

The impression I am getting is that the main issue lies with the preparation for this epidemic, though it's harder to criticise them on this alone. I'm sure this situation is not benefitting the govt at all (with GE coming up) so they probably did what they thought was the best thing to do, even if the consequences were damaging to smaller businesses, for example.

Sorry, but this is pretty damn naive. 

I'd rather the G respect the uncertainty inherent in this novel pandemic and admit the situation is fluid rather than commit themselves to a fixed timeframe or number of cases.

Yes, it would be bad for retailers, etc. Many people's livelihoods are affected. However, this sounds more like making COVID-19 a reason to blame the govt instead.

No visible action was taken to prevent such issues from happening again.

Then some organisations had warned, at the start of covid, the risks again. Still no visible action.

Then one FW got Covid. They managed to isolate him. This was back in Feb.

At that time there wasn't any indication of CB happening in future, and masks were not yet mandated, SHN had breaches and many who had to serve SHN were saying instructions were unclear. I believe you know this part.

Then all of a sudden our cases started picking up, with the dorms starting to get affected. Then CB, up to now.

Basically, everything that was done and wasn't, as above, led to the situation we see in the dorms now.

But what could have been prevented was if clearer enforcement were in place, and if FW dorms policies were strict enough. Additionally, many FWs seem to have reservations about seeking medical treatment, but I think it's possible that they are afraid of their employers coming down on them. There were even cases of Employers who initially wanted to send all their workers for the free covid tests so that they could potentially get some money from the govt. So another thing about enforcement by the MOM. 

But the main thing was, if it wasn't for the fact that despite a track history of infectious disease outbreaks, nothing much was seemingly done (at least a documentation or open plans in place for such a situation for the dorms, that unfortunately has finally happened), we would be in a different situation today.

The govt had a plan for SARS, because SARS happened. But what about infectious diseases in the dorms? Was there no previous history?",2020-05-30 16:53:07

BBT shops tend to be tiny without much space to manoeuvre, and most do not have tables & chairs at all for dining in prior to the CB. If there's a queue, consumers plus delivery folks end up congregating in a group for the more popular outlets.

For those coffee outlets, with the lack of office workers nowadays I think their demand has went down. Even if they had more customers, there is likely space in their shops for them to do their waiting.

When I actually went to Toa Payoh Central once during the pre-tightened CB at 3pm (I'd assume this is not peak period), it was quite crazy looking at the stretch of 3 BBT shops in close proximity. Around 3-8 people in front of each shop, plus delivery folks waiting around. It became a congregation of about 30 people.

The Starbucks opposite the BBT shops on the other hand, was empty save for 1 customer.

Therefore I think this is why the coffee-based ones are allowed to continue operating and the BBT not.",2020-05-30 22:44:34

Additionally, policies from a previous epidemic can be used, and were used for the community and country, in preparation for the covid, but there was a sense of over-reliance on what was done for SARS, that some areas were overlooked. SARS didn't have widespread community transmission, but Covid-19 did.

So in this aspect, the government had to think of the possibilities in which the Covid-19 situation could get worse, and plan policies from there. But because at each escalation of the situation, things were changing quite fast, they didn't evaluate properly (or at least that's what we think) the consequences of each action.

The govt isn't wholly incompetent in the handling of epidemics, in fact, we did some necessary steps, such as the banning of flights, but the parts where they didn't, it was a case of wrong timing, and various other factors. 

For us to discuss the incompetence, we also have to realise the amount of available information at that point in time when they planned a policy. We must realise also that when we are discussing a past event, we already know the consequences of the policies.

Like when will this  cb end? When they said one month,  i think a lot of people were willing  to tahan and accept it, even those retailers. One month isnt that bad.  Then it became 2 while most of the cases werent in community but migrant  dorms. Then its 3. When community cases were 4 on average per day. If  we can't even open up at that number,  how can we be certain we will  ever hit phase 2 when phase 1 will definitely cause community cases to  go up?

To be fair, the whole situation is so fluid that no one can know what will happen. To say the government is not trying to help the retailers is also BS. The JSS scheme, rental waivers those are things that the government is trying to help businesses.

That said, there will be some business that will go bust because they were already tethering on the edge. As much as we would like to save all business, there is no way the government can do it. 

Anyway, there is a plan to open up, but plans don't survive the first contact with the enemy and you just have to adapt accordingly",2020-05-30 17:27:17

If that was the case, then the uncertainty would have been caused by them. I'm not defending the govt here, I'm just pointing out that we should criticise the govt for the right reasons.

Regarding lockdown extensions, on one hand it makes sense that the govt probably wants a period (likely a week) where there are no cases. That's the SG style of management as far as I've seen. However, that doesn't mean we should approve of it, and I understand where you are coming from. It looks to me that as always, the govt is ready to make ""economic sacrifices"" at the cost of smaller businesses, in exchange for a more ""safe"" end of lockdown.

Regarding COVID-19 Management,"Hello all, I'm just a curious average bloke and would like to pose a question to the r/singapore community: How do you think the SG government has handled COVID-19 so far?

I agree it's not their fault that they're so popular and creating queues, but to me their chance was before the tightened CB. If nothing changed in those 3 weeks even after some have been fined/warned, what can reasonably change after that? Most partnered with restaurants for delivery after shutting their physical stores down, not sure how they doing, or how the BBT lovers are doing with that arrangement.

McDonald's didn't close due to massive queues forming, so it's not exactly similar. And it's food compared to drink.",2020-05-31 12:57:52

> Apart from the 20 COVID-related deaths, six patients who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including a 44-year-old Bangladeshi man who died of a heart attack on Tuesday.

> As of 4 May, the ministry has conducted 175,604 swab tests, of which 123,525 were done on unique individuals.

> Of the cases, 860 are foreign workers living in dormitories, said the ministry. There is one imported case and four cases in the local community.

> Also, the ministry said that it had recently found that 33 cases from a laboratory were false positives, “due to an apparatus calibration issue for one of its test kits”. This was discovered as a result of its regular reviews of laboratory tests.

> Subsequent retesting at the National Public Health Laboratory confirmed that these were negative cases. “There were no false negative results discovered from our review,” MOH said. “MOH has taken immediate actions to rectify the situation. The laboratory has stopped all tests and is working to resolve the calibration issue.”

> In addition, the ministry said, “There were two results that had been equivocal, and were subsequently verified to be negative upon re-testing.”

> It added that all equivocal results are sent to the National Public Health Laboratory for re-testing. “As a precautionary measure, we had categorised Cases 18669 and 19360 as positive while pending verification, and isolated them.”

"COVID-19: Singapore confirms 876 new cases, total crosses 23,000",,"\[opinion\] Yesterday, I discussed [my interpretation of ""backlog cases](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ggavxx/singapore_reports_753_new_covid19_cases_taking/fpyyj3s/?context=3)"". I think that ""backlog cases"" consist of the suspect cases of people who are staying in dorms which have known infections.

I noticed from the [SHN+QO tab on this site](https://covidsitrep.moh.gov.sg/), there is still a big number of ""Active Number of Persons Under Quarantine (PUQ) on May 9.

* PUQs pending quarantine location : 1286
* PUQs being transferred to hospital : 310
* PUQs in non-Gazetted Dorms : 17436
* PUQs in Gazetted Dorms : 319
* PUQs in Government Quarantine Facility : 9184
* PUQs in Home Quarantine Order : 592

I am guessing these numbers are indication of the number of ""backlog cases"" (suspect cases).  As QOs are issued everyday due to new cases, the total PUQs will never drop to 0.

Instead of 0, when the number of PUQs drop to less than 10000 (early April levels), then we would have cleared this ""backlog"".",2020-05-10 16:26:33

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 451 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Wednesday (10 June) noon, bringing the total to 38,965.

> “Based on our investigations so far, there are seven cases in the community, of whom three are Singaporeans/permanent residents and four are work pass holders.,” said the MOH, adding that the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories.

> The ministry said more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of over 2,700 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Jurong Penjuru Dormitory, and Tuas View Dormitory.

> The four are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas.

> Some 400,000 such workers live in dorms here in Singapore, of which about 10 per cent have been cleared of the infection, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on 1 June during a press conference.

> Over 20,000 infected foreign workers have recovered, added Teo.

> The story will be updated later at night.

> MOH STATEMENT IN FULL

> On Tuesday, the ministry added one more public place to a list of locations – first published on 25 May – visited by infectious cases in the community for over 30 minutes.

> Hougang Green Shopping Mall at 21 Hougang Street 51 was visited on 3 June from 12pm to 1pm.

> The list – which excludes residences, workplaces, healthcare facilities, and public transport – will be updated on a rolling 14-day basis or one incubation period.

> With 509 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Tuesday, 25,877 cases – 71.5 per cent of the total tally – have fully recovered from the infection.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while three are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Over 12,300 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 25 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, nine others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and two whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> As of 1 June, the ministry has conducted 408,495 swab tests, of which 264,393 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 71,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 46,400 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

I'll also subtract of the 33K preschool staff who were mass screened. This leaves at most 192K unique people swabbed who could be foreign workers. Realistically speaking, >50K other people should be locals, maybe quite a bit more. So most foreign workers have not yet been tested.

"COVID-19: Singapore confirms 533 new cases, total at 32,876",,"> # COVID-19: Singapore confirms 533 new cases, total at 32,876

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 533 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Wednesday (27 May) noon, bringing the total to 32,876.

> Of them, the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories, said the ministry, while three remaining cases are Singaporeans or permanent residents.

> It added that more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of over 2,500 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tuas View Dormitory and Jurong Penjuru Dormitory.

> They are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some 400,000 foreign workers live in dorms here in Singapore.

> Some 20,000 infected foreign workers are expected to be discharged by the end of this month, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong at a press conference on 12 May.

> This story will be updated later.

> MOH’S STATEMENT IN FULL

> With 706 more cases of COVID-19 infection discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, a total of 16,444 cases here have fully recovered from the infection, said the MOH on Tuesday.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while eight are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Apart from 23 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, nine others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and two whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> It had also noted that 86 male foreign workers aged 25 to 59 died due to heart disease in Singapore in 2018.

> As of 25 May, the ministry has conducted 334,691 swab tests, of which 218,996 were done on unique individuals.

> This translates to around 58,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 38,400 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

Think about it. It is a question of levels of responsibility. At the event level, there is nothing LTA or TP could have done really. Someone wants to drive fast, who can stop the person? 

But at the system level, LTA and TP can put in place a governance structure and traffic systems (like speed camera, traffic lights, speed bumps, etc etc) to prevent speeding. And they have done this very well. Exceptionally well. Hence , speeding on roads in Singapore isn't a huge problem.

Same with MOM. At the event level, if a dorm operator decides not to comply to regulations and allow too many workers to sleep in a small space, creating a fire and health hazard that night, what can MOM do? MOM cannot be everywhere. 

BUT - if MOM had put in place a regulatory and incentive framework that works, with a proper system of audits, a system that strongly disincentives dorm operators from flouting the regulations, then we will not be in the shit we are today.

But they didn't. Hence MOM is to be blamed at that level of responsibility. What is governance for anyway if there is no corresponding responsibility? In the good old days, Ministers may even commit hari kiri if they are honourable.....",2020-05-04 23:41:34

Why? Because the workers are at a disadvantage. They get into debt coming to Singapore and they have no ability to walk out of a bad contract or working condition. The moment they lose their visa, they lose their income, go bankrupt, and were evicted. They can't switch employers. Governments see to it that the employees are punished that way.

> SINGAPORE - Almost two-thirds of the 35 dormitory operators here are punished each year for breaching dormitory licensing conditions under the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act (Feda).

> This adds up to about 20 operators, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said in Parliament on Monday (May 4). These 35 firms run the 43 purpose-built dormitories housing some 200,000 foreign workers.

> Outside of large dormitories, an average of 1,200 employers a year have also been punished for providing unacceptable accommodation for their workers, said Mrs Teo, responding to questions from MPs, including Workers' Party MP Png Eng Huat (Hougang), who asked about the virus outbreak among foreign workers.

> She told the House that accommodation standards for migrant workers have become better over the years, but acknowledged that further improvements could be made.

> The living conditions in these large dormitories have been under scrutiny in recent weeks as the number of workers infected with Covid-19 rises.

> ""We will see how standards can be raised, but keep in mind there are also older dorms which perhaps might not have reached these standards yet,"" said Mrs Teo, after showing MPs pictures of living conditions in newer dormitories.

> The minister said that when lapses are found, these must be rectified immediately. Dorm operators can be fined up to $50,000, jailed for up to a year, or both for such offences.

> For other housing types, employers can be fined up to $10,000, face a jail term of up to one year, or both under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act.

> She pointed out that her ministry has about 100 dormitory inspectors who work under the supervision of the Commissioner for Foreign Employee Dormitories, two deputy commissioners and eight assistant commissioners. Last year, these officers conducted 1,200 inspections and 3,000 investigations across the different housing types in which foreign workers in Singapore are accommodated.

> Apart from the 200,000 workers housed in large dormitories, there are about 95,000 workers living in factory-converted dormitories. Most of these workers are from the construction, marine and process sectors.

> Another 20,000 workers are housed in temporary quarters on construction sites.

> Related Story New facilities to be built for workers in dorms who have recovered from Covid-19 or have mild symptoms

> There are also 85,000 work permit and S Pass holders from the construction sector who live in HDB flats, private residential premises and other sites.

> While the Covid-19 situation in large dormitories are ""largely stable now"", the situation in factory-converted dormitories and quarters at construction sites presents a mixed picture ""and (is) taking up much bandwidth"".

> Responding to concerns raised by MPs, Mrs Teo said the Government has ""taken steps to raise the housing standards of our migrant workers"" over the years.

> It passed Feda in 2015, which imposes higher standards on dormitories that accommodate 1,000 or more workers - the Act requires recreational facilities to be provided, as well as amenities like mini-marts and Wi-Fi in common areas.

> ""They are also required to have health facilities like sickbays or isolation rooms and draw up contingency plans for quarantine arrangements,"" she said, adding that the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) had asked all Feda-licensed dormitories to set aside at least 10 quarantine rooms each in February, which have proved useful for isolating close contacts in facilities with few infected workers.

> For smaller accommodation types that are not covered under Feda, they have to comply with regulations under different agencies, she said.

> Mrs Teo also took MPs through how workers came to be housed in such large dormitories, noting that as more construction workers from China, Bangladesh, Myanmar and India came to Singapore in the early 1990s, the Government allocated land for self-contained dormitories with recreational facilities to be built.

> Explaining the thinking behind housing them in these communal facilities, she said: ""One important consideration was what would a migrant worker want at the end of the work day, if he cannot be with his family? Well, it is to be with his friends, cook a meal he would like, practise his religious beliefs.""

> But she also said that such environments now carry the risk of significant Covid-19 transmission, and there was a need to relook how people interact in homes and workplaces.

> ""What changes will be effective in reducing the transmission risks? Will these changes require different space requirements and technical standards or stronger regulatory levers that Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) asked about?"" she said.

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> ""When this is over, we will reflect and thoroughly look into areas where we could have done better, so that we will be better prepared the next time.""

> She told members that Singapore has a responsibility to its migrant workers, many of whom have made personal sacrifices to come to work in Singapore and contribute to its development.

> ""We will do everything within our means to make sure that they too win the fight against Covid-19, and reunite with their families in time to come,"" she said.

No iTs nOt RacIST tO NoT waNT tO LiVe nEaR FoReiGN WoRkerS,,"**TLDR: I disagree with most aspects of the arguments from the Critical Spectator poster (henceforth ""CS guy"") but I believe that this reasoning doesn't make him a racist.**

The word ""racist"" has been too frequently used as an end-all counterargument that it has lost its powerful original meaning. A racist is someone who deems his ethnicity to be superior to other ethnicities and acts based on this belief. A racist is an asshole by default, but the reverse is not necessarily true: you can be an inconsiderate, unsympathetic and uncompassionate idiot (like the CS guy) and **not** be a racist.

Reading the CS guy's post, I see that he opposes new dorm construction on economic and social grounds. These arguments are ridiculous. On the economic reason - I don't see any statistically significant reduction in housing prices in areas with dense foreign worker population (Little India, Jalan Besar, Bencoolen). In fact, these are lively areas whose ethnic diversity serves as a magnet to local/international tourists and a driver of economic activities (restaurants, shops, etc). In addition, the CS guy peppered his post with various unfounded, sometimes asinine assumptions: that people anywhere hate living next to ""social housing"", that migrant men want to ""hook up with maid girlfriends"", that the dorms would take up spaces that otherwise would be used to make parks and pools, etc. These are all broad, untenable assumptions that show how little he knows about how these migrants work and behave.

But - and this is a big but - those arguments don't make him a racist. By simply calling him a racist without taking on his arguments directly you won't change his opinion; rather, he will simply see you as a virtue-signalling SJW and the discussion will ground to a halt. If we want to have a conversation with somebody like the CS guy and influence the public discourse, let's avoid loaded terms like ""racist"", ""xenophobic"", etc unless they are really called for.",2020-06-06 19:58:34

If I were to pick a chinese who grew up in california versus a chinese who grew up in beijing, chances are the one in california would be more liberal and outgoing wouldn’t it? Simply because the society in california is more open minded than that of beijing. 

Here’s another analogy. Would you rather have your son/daughter date a black who grew up in a community where gang wars, rape, robbery, assault is the norm or one who grew up in a safer community?

You have never met either of them and that’s the only information you know. Statistically and logically you would go with the second choice wouldn’t you? Maybe the first guy is a saint and the second guy is a psychopath but the chances of this is low. 

Racism is a huge problem, but I think hypocritically denigrating people for racism is also a problem. The analogy I raised above is basic human instinct 101, but more and more people are just hiding these thoughts for the fear of being called a racist.

What you would want to do, as a society, is give a chance to those who overcome the stereotype - in other words, the black guy who, despite his poor upbringing, seems like a genuinely good person. Why use cultural stereotypes to judge someone instead of judging him or her based on their actions, their words, and their character?

I also agree that there's this unfortunate tendency to label someone as racist and leave it at that. I think this results in unnecessary polarisation and doesn't explore the bases of their beliefs and prejudices - hence not actually reducing racism, but driving it underground.

If you encounter a sympomatic person in lets say, S11 dormitory. I think at this point you can just assume that he is infected without a test and that is pretty much what they have decided to do.

> This brings the total number of reported cases in Singapore to 26,891.

> Among the confirmed cases, just one is a Singaporean or Permanent Resident.

> The majority of the cases are Work Permit holders residing in foreign worker dormitories.

> Further updates will be shared in a separate announcement from the Ministry on Friday evening.

> Single-digit community cases for past five days

> In the past five days, Singapore reported a sustained single-digit number of community cases.

> According to MOH's definition, ""community cases"" refer to the incidence of spread among Singaporeans, PRs and Work Pass holders.

> Daily community cases

> May 10: 4 (2 Singaporeans/PRs, 2 Work Passes)

> May 11: 3 (2 Singaporeans/PRs, 1 Work Pass)

> May 12: 4 (3 Singaporeans/PRs, 1 Work Pass)

> May 13: 4 ( 2 Singaporeans/PRs, 2 Work Passes)

> May 14: 2 ( 2 Singaporeans/PRs)

> Individuals being discharged from facilities also on the rise

> The number of Covid-19-positive individuals who are reported to have been discharged from quarantine facilities has also been on the rise in recent days, hitting record highs each day over the past five days, topping off at 1,164 on May 14.

> Numbers of individuals discharged

> May 10: 425

> May 11: 504

> May 14: 1,164

> MOH to test entire population of 300,000 migrant workers and pre-school staff

> On May 12, the Multi-Ministry Task Force said that it would be testing the entire population of 300,000 dormitory-dwelling migrant workers, in order to facilitate their eventual safe return to work.

> All preschool staff in Singapore will also be tested from Friday (May 15) for Covid-19 ahead of centres reopening, at a date the Ministry for Social and Family development have not yet announced.

> Govt agencies recruiting swab assistants and Covid-19 test swabbers

> Additionally, MOH aims to ramp up the number of Covid-19 tests to 40,000 per day by the later part of the year.

> To facilitate this, a recruitment exercise is being conducted by the Health Promotion Board (HPB), the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC), and the Employment and Employability Institute (e2i).

> Individuals who are hired as swab assistants will earn a monthly salary of S$3,400, while those who are converted to swabbers will earn S$3,800 a month.

> This has caused disquiet over several in the medical community, however, with some questioning the high salaries being paid to applicants relative to starting salaries of fresh graduates in nursing, for instance:

The upside if this is that we'll get a pretty good picture of how many percent infected, how many percent asymptomatic, how many percent severe and need hospital and so on for a given age cohort. Besides doing hard labor for us they are also serving as a epidemiological study of covid.

This [mothership article](https://mothership.sg/2020/05/employer-migrant-workers-quarantine/) also identifies some of the Government Quarantine Facilities(GQF), such a mix of hotels, an industrial space, other dormitories, Singapore EXPO, Clementi Sports Centre, or Tanjong Gul Camp.

There were articles on some army camps and floating ""dorms"" being prepared. I guess some of them are probably used as GQF, others might be used to house ""cleared"" (repeatedly tested negative) work pass holders.",2020-05-15 17:48:37

> The treatment these workers have received is in stark contrast to the fate of such workers in many other countries where they have been given short shrift.

> Singapore has supplied food, shelter, wage payment, medical treatment and other comforts.

> In some instances, the food was not suitable for some of the workers, and pictures of discarded food were shared. This was rectified the following day after feedback from the workers.

> I feel that the government response has been measured and correct regarding the epidemiological aspects, and the humanitarian measures are truly second to none.

> I was aghast on Monday when Nominated MP Anthea Ong asked the Government to apologise for the handling of the migrant workers.

> I believe this pandemic requires full support from all and any attempts at grandstanding or ""actionism"" should be curbed at source.

Depending on the straight-forwardness of the case, it probably takes anywhere from instantly to even more than a day before results can come back. Maybe it takes 2 hours, maybe it takes no time at all (dorm case for example), maybe it takes even longer. Keep in mind that this is a best case scenario. We probably don't have enough contact tracers waiting around that the moment that a person is diagnosed, a contact tracer can interview them immediately.

New dorm standards good for workers but will come with inevitable cost hike: Dorm operators,,"> # New dorm standards good for workers but will come with inevitable cost hike: Dorm operators

> SINGAPORE - New standards for migrant worker dormitories will enhance workers' well-being, said dormitory operators here, but will come with a cost increase of at least 50 per cent to implement them in existing dorms.

> Under new specifications announced by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Monday (June 1), dorms will have no more than 10 beds per room, with only single-deck beds and 1m spacing between them. Each room now holds 12 to 16 beds.

> In recent weeks, the living conditions of foreign workers in dormitories have come under scrutiny as workers account for more than 90 per cent of Covid-19 cases here.

> Each resident will enjoy 6 sq m of living space, not including shared facilities, compared with 4.5 sq m now, which includes shared facilities. Not more than five people will share a toilet, bathroom and sink, compared with 15 people currently.

> As a result, costs will increase significantly on all fronts, said dorm operators, with most agreeing on at least 50 per cent.

> Mr Calvin Lim, general manager of CDPL (Tuas) Dormitory, said building costs could even double, depending on factors such as the dorm's remaining lease-term and its tenancy agreements with employers.

> ""If all things stayed constant and we just reduced double-deck beds to single beds, the cost per bed could already be doubled. And that's excluding the other changes and the additional operational costs that are bound to increase over time,"" he said.

> President of the Dormitory Association of Singapore Johnathan Cheah expects building costs to double, along with a 50 per cent increase in operating costs. These should be shared by employers, dorm operators and the Government, he said.

> ""Dorm operations might well be a 24/7 feature in future as more manpower would be needed to implement the measures, such as stepping up on housekeeping,"" he said.

> Related Story New standards to be piloted at upcoming Quick Build Dorms

> Related Story Most residents understand why workers moved to estates: MPs

> Centurion chief executive Kong Chee Min agreed that building costs will make the bulk of the cost increase, though he did not specify by how much.

> He said existing and interested new operators have to consider the cost of development and operations as well as the revenue potential in the open market, to assess the viability of the business.

> He said: ""There'll be a continued need for migrant worker housing and purpose-built dormitories will continue to be the best solution to address such housing needs in land-scarce Singapore.""

> The new specifications will be piloted at upcoming Quick Build Dormitories, short- to medium-term housing to house around 25,000 workers. These semi-permanent structures will be ready by the end of this year and will last for about two to three years.

> The Straits Times understands that new and existing operators are likely to be invited to run these upcoming dorms, although the authorities have yet to detail licensing and cost arrangements.

> Another 11 purpose-built dorms to house up to 100,000 workers are in the works and are expected to be ready in the next two years.

> Mr Jack Ng, facilities manager of Hulett Dormitory, said he will look at upgrading his 1,200-bed factory converted dormitory at Senoko Drive after some workers can be rehoused in the Quick Build Dormitories.

> Related Story Racism and xenophobia resurfacing during Covid-19: MCCY minister Grace Fu

> He added that Hulett Dormitory, which charges $280 per worker per month, has no plans to increase its prices at the moment as it is focused on getting the dorm a cleared status from MOM so workers can resume work.

> Dr Harvey Neo, programme head at the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, said the new guidelines are a ""significant improvement"" as they distinguish between different living spaces and reduce density in the dorms.

> Regardless of how the cost is distributed among the various stakeholders, Dr Neo said it should not filter down to the foreign workers as there is ""no compelling reason"" to do so.

> Mr Lee Chew Chiat, government and public services industry leader at Deloitte South-east Asia, said while the cost hike is inevitable, it is worth considering what the alternative cost would be without these new measures in time of pandemics such as Covid-19.

> He said: ""The fundamental question should be why do we need these new measures? If we are doing it for the right reasons, then it's wise to implement them and then work to increase the benefit over cost.""

Also, labor only forms part of the construction cost which only forms part of the overall cost of HDB flats.

Hoping all ends well for the dormitories (@highnunchicken),,"1) I mentioned I did go to some of the affected dorms before. I went to a few when they were just newly built. 

2) Yes, I am shifting some blame to the FW too here, because I also happen to know dorm operators. These FWs aren't kindergarten kids, they also need to have the responsibility to clean their own living quarters. If kitchen sink choke, why? Is it they never take the effort to clear the sink after cooking? It is not that hard to imagine that FW don't clean up their own living quarters, because in army the same thing happens /will happen if there is no enforced area cleaning.

To further clarify, some of dormitories in factories like in Sungei Kadut are really poor in quality, this I must agree. However, this is not an issue that can be solved in a short period of time.

Hoping all ends well for the dormitories (@highnunchicken),,"If govt channels back the funds from the levy into improving living conditions (through subsidising dorms, food etc), that kind of defeats the purpose of the levy because the money will go back to the employer. 

And another problem with improving living conditions can be very subjective - current [purpose built dorms](https://www1.bca.gov.sg/buildsg/manpower/foreign-worker-dormitories) are already tendered out and regulated by BCA, meaning they have standards to meet such as X m2 of space per pax, cleaning schedules etc. You can only go so far in mandating that the operator meets certain living standards that are quantifiable such as cleaning schedules, caloric requirements per meal, personal space per pax. How about regulating subjective things like taste of food or cuisine, dirty personal accomodation (which can be a lapse in the dorm operator's obligations or lack of personal hygiene by the residents)? Because if you want to penalise or reward dorm operators based on meeting these standards, there must be something that you can measure, not based on opinion. 

I'm not defending or criticising dorm operators and the regulators - but there are challenges with regards to regulation in general and things will never be black and white. It's very easy to be an armchair critic because we are not exposed to the stakeholders' situation, the quirks of each situation etc. It's never blame on one party, and the way the government acts is representative of society's stand on that issue - in this case that largely, society wants FWs kept to a minimum, out of sight, out of mind, and the bare minimum for them.",2020-04-13 09:31:20
Hoping all ends well for the dormitories (@highnunchicken),,"The purpose is to equalise the costs of having a local and FW, not to encourage locals to join. Having the levy will not encourage firms to hire locals because it's pointless for the construction sector, it's to encourage them to reduce FW headcount and focus on automation, optimisation, upskilling the limited pool of FW. Else employers will hire FWs like it's water out of a tap and locals cannot find a job.

Ben Leong: Teaching Moments from Fighting COVID19,"FB: notes/ben-leong/teaching-moments-from-fighting-covid19/10157484861167549/

ben leong writing a post in response to the earlier post by tan meng wah. 

his post is too long to post in whole. so just put summary. but read his whole fb post first before commenting  

> Summary

> Boys and girls, to conclude, I would like to summarize for you the key lessons that I would like you to remember:

> (a) Data has context. It’s not simply a matter of how many infected cases a country reports. You need to understand where the data comes from and how it is obtained. The capacity limits for COVID testing means that we need to be wary about believing the data and it is not because anyone is intentionally under-reporting.

> (b) Don’t just believe what people tell you. Just because people tell you that if the dorms were better everything would be ok, you don’t just believe them. You ask why should it be? Don’t just take at face value. Just because someone has a PhD, don’t just believe him. Heck, don’t even believe me. Derive everything again by yourself from first principles.

> (c) Learn to use imagination and do thought experiments. Someone tells you, if you only  listened to me and did this, everything will be good. Well, you just happily imagine that they were right and ask yourself, then what? The problem with these big mouths who talk a lot is that they just shoot off their mouths. They have no accountability to actually do anything. They have no sense of perspective, no sense of the costs and no sense of the practical constraints.

> (d) Have a sense of perspective. We are not the only country to have massive numbers of foreign or migrant workers. I don’t believe that the living conditions of our foreigner workers are the worst in the world. Other countries have no COVID infections in their dorms or dorm-equivalents we think? Are people so naive? Note that as far as I know, we are the *only* country, where the PM has appeared on national TV to assure the foreign workers. To tell them, not worry, Singapore will take care of them. Think about that for a moment. 

> (e) School v Real Life. My complaint about school is that it often misleads our students into thinking that every problem has a model  answer. Not true in life.

Some people asked, where is the money coming from to improve conditions?

Tell me again, how much are the dorm operators earning? According to some reports, it's between 30 million to 100 million profit in 2019 alone. So, this is not enough?  https://www.straitstimes.com/forum/forum-why-foot-the-bill-for-dorm-operators-that-have-profited-for-years",2020-05-26 00:08:53

> On this note, all please be good. Stay home and stay safe! If you need to go out, observe safe distancing and wash your hands regularly.","I shall reproduce Ben Leong's full post below for your reading convenience, since OP only posted the summary.

>I hope everyone is doing well. This past Semester has been quite a harrowing one and being cooped up at home for so long is making me really edgy. I am writing this note because I found one of my students sharing this note by one Dr Tan Meng Wah, with the comment “Good read.” I read, and I was horrified that my student thought it was a good read. 
 
>I think it’s drivel and I am well-aware of the Streisand Effect, but still I would encourage everyone to read it, before reading what I have to say. Always good to read two sides of the story and then decide. Don’t just listen to one side. 
 
>This note will be TL;DR, but given the complexities of what we will be discussing, cannot be helped. 
 
>**Pre-Amble (Can Skip)**
 
>And given the complex environment that is the Internet today, allow me to start with the following pre-amble to provide some context and some disclaimers. 
 
>1. This note is written mainly for my students because I think it is important for them to learn how to make sense of life and what happens, from first gathers “facts” and then analyzing the situation from first principles. It should be clear why I think that this COVID19 crisis presents us with a good teaching moment. 
 
>2. This is a very unpleasant note to write, because I will effectively be defending the Government. That’s something that’s almost as cool as having to wipe my 5-year-old’s behind every couple of hours after he poops because of CB (never had to do this before. :’(). Ordinarily, I wouldn’t bother to defend the Government, because I am not paid enough to do that. But these are not ordinary times. We don’t have enough reasonable voices saying reasonable things. We need more sense making during this time of confusion and anxiety. For this reason, I thought I better step up and say something. Earlier, I was also too swamped with work and e-exams.
 
>3. Declaration of potential conflict of interest: I am currently tangentially involved in the nation’s COVID19 efforts. SAF has been activated. SAF approached me because I have certain specialized skills and I am now effectively the commander of a small group of literally “keyboard warriors” supporting SAF, to support MOH in our (manual) contact tracing processes. The reason why I am declaring this is not because I want to pretend to be some kind of hero. We are not. My students and I are playing a v v small and insignificant part. All credit goes to the real frontliners who are wearing PPE fighting the virus daily. I am declaring this because if I don’t, and some kaypoh learns about this later, I will get accused of being some kind of PAP mole sent by the COVID Taskforce to do PR. Such is the perilous nature of the internet this days. Do good also scared people find out. Allow me to make clear that my team and I are the grunts. We don’t get anywhere close to dunno what Ministerial Task Force. I want to clarify that I have had no access whatsoever to any kind of privileged information and everything that I will be talking about in this post comes from information that is publicly available online.
 
>**Let’s Role-Play MTF**
 
>Dr Tan wrote a lot of the usual opposition drivel about how the Government is bad and the PAP is incompetent. I am not going to be bothered to address those. I am not sure that there’s anything new there and the Government can jolly well deal with it when they are done fighting COVID. Not my problem. I will keep my analysis to COVID19 related issues. 
 
>To better understand the crisis and how to deal with the crisis, let’s pretend for a moment that we’re the Ministerial Task Force (MTF) for COVID19.
 
>It is now Jan 2020. Wuhan is burning and it is in lockdown. We know that this is going to be a problem. We don’t know what we are dealing with exactly. We kiasi, quickly ban Wuhan, then we ban China and we form this dunno what MTF. 
 
>We don’t know what’s happening yet because the Chinese are too busy keeping their people from dying and studies have not been done. What do we assume? At this point, there are 2 choices: (i) we assume it’s going to kill us like SARS; and (ii) we can go with POTUS that this is just a “Chinese flu”. 
 
>We’re Singaporeans. Don’t be ridiculous. Of course we kiasi and assume SARS. We open the drawer and take out SARS SOP and execute. 
 
>Singapore’s ability to execute SOP is breath-taking. Clearly, if COVID19 were SARS, COVID19 would have been wiped out many times over. 
 
>To be fair, our initial execution was flawless. We were proclaimed the world’s Gold standard. So far, so good. 
 
>**To Mask or Not to Mask, That is the Question**
 
>This is where a lot of self-proclaimed geniuses will tell you that the Government had failed when it told the population that they didn’t have to wear masks and then had to U-turn. 4 doctors had come out to say that they advocated the wearing of masks in Feb 2020. Why didn’t the Government listen? 
 
>This is where I will take a short break to scold the Government for saying that no need to wear masks because “masks not required.” Siao. You tell my grandma that it’s not effective my grandma also won’t believe you. How can be not effective? If not effective, the medical personnel wear masks for what? To look good ah?
 
>Hold that thought.
 
>At the same time, there are also complaints that supply of masks running out. People complain cannot buy masks. 
 
>People don’t know this *that* time, but we later know because of Madam Ho, what happened at the same time was that while ST had a N95 factory line and were ready to ship masks back to Singapore, Taiwan had banned us from exporting the masks back to Singapore? Do we announce this to the public so that we can all be pissed at Taiwan together? No cannot. Must diam diam. We announce this, we will create panic*. 
 
> \*For now, all don’t panic and worry about masks -- confirm got enough: https://www.thinkchina.sg/china-will-have-too-many-mask-making-factories. Quality might be a problem but the supply is there. 
 
>Let’s come back to this question: should we make it compulsory to wear masks? This question needs to be answered at 2 levels

>(i) Suppose we did make it compulsory to wear masks, and remember, this was pre-CB, so everyone is out as per normal. That means we will burn ~5 million masks a day. Dr Tan talks so much. Where is he and all the others who talk a lot going to cough up the masks? Talk is cheap hor. Keep in mind that our “supposed” friends are screwing us over and we don’t dare to announce publicly. If people want to know why we didn’t stockpile 5 million x 365 days worth of masks, don’t have to put up PQ, I tell you. SARS SOP didn’t need that. So yes, the PAP Government was not omniscient enough to know we will have COVID19 this year. Damn lousy lah. People should vote Dr Tan in next GE. He is clearly omniscient. Did anyone calculate how much 5 million x 365 days worth of masks would have cost us if COVID19 didn’t happen? 
 
>(ii) For the second level, did we *really* think we need to make everyone wear masks? It might be surprising that this is even a question, but it is -- and this is what separates the people who actually learnt something about probability in school and those who only know how to answer exam questions. 
 
>This is Jan-Feb 2020. Singapore has activated the world’s most efficient contact tracing system. Every single infected one we catch, we send to NCID. All their friends kenna quarantined. It seemed to work. That’s why we’re the gold standard. What does that mean? That means that even though we know there are likely some infected people that we haven’t yet identified and caught, we don’t expect them to be many. Conservatively, let’s say 100. With hindsight, that’s maybe too small, but at *that* point, that’s as good as it gets.
 
>What is 100? Roughly, that’s probably the number of MediaCorp actors and actresses we have? I suspect MediaCorp has more. How often do you get to meet Zoe Tay or Fann Wong? I have never seen them in person in my life. 
 
>Note that you can only catch COVID from someone who has been infected. If there are only 100 of them running around, your probability of getting hemorrhoids is likely higher. 
 
>Let’s use an army analogy to make the situation more obvious. The masks are like bullets. If you are not likely to meet the enemy, you shoot the bullets for what? Conserve bullets when when they are needed and only the people likely to meet the enemy, i.e. firstline healthcare workers, should wear masks loh. 
 
>In other words, not wearing masks was the correct and most logical choice at that point. What other choice do people think we have? All wear masks, masks come from where? Dr Tan refers to this situation as a political consideration. Not enough masks is not enough masks simi sai political situation? Dr Tan and his 4 doctors can supply ah? 
 
>Basically, on the mask wearing issue, the Government did get the answer right (it was judged both impractical and of not urgent need), but got the working wrong, so kenna marked wrong. 
 
>Dr Tan mentioned that “To solve the shortage problem, the Government approached 400 suppliers in about 20 countries to buy more masks. At the same time, volunteers and female inmates from the Correctional Services were mobilized to help boost production of masks to 90,000 a day or 2.5 million masks a month.” 
 
>Implication is what? Singapore Government sleeping on the job and never go and try to buy masks? Well, what’s that ugly that looks like a bra, but not quite, in our house now? Dr Tan provide one or Hong Kong government procure for us he thinks?

I like the part he mentioned about foreign worker which he put it in a nice way and is very astute. It gives other people something to think about. Lobbyists are gonna be working hard again.

>Suppose the Government has just listened to these NGOs. Every single one of these foreigner workers had their own single rooms with attached bathroom and sauna. Best in Singapore and Batam also. We throw in a cleaning auntie to do area cleaning for them and do their laundry. Just imagine that. 


> Do we believe that it would have allowed us to avoid the current problem with the foreign worker dorms? 
Obviously, this would increase social distancing and *maybe* help somewhat. **But guess what? The workers will still be eating together and working together.  Do people  understand how infectious this virus is? Even healthcare workers in full PPE can still catch it. Confirm will still kenna. Who are we kidding?**


>Keep in mind that we would not be requiring them to wear masks -- because our own people were not asked to wear masks then. You want to discriminate against these foreign workers? 


>**My point: all these claims that acceding to the earlier demands of these NGOs and activists would have allowed us to avoid the current foreigner worker COVID situation is hogwash. Plain and simple.**


The below part is very true. But up for yourself to judge.


>Why are we misled into thinking that it would help? Because our brains are lazy. We want easy solutions. Part of it is also the Government’s fault. The Government didn’t offer us any reason for how and why the situation imploded in the dorm. Given the lack of an alternative, people just accept what is offered, hook, line and sinker.

Some lobbyist has replied back to the Facebook post disagreeing. While I agree on some of her points, I worry on the last part of 'Singapore can do better'. Sure we can.... who pay the money? Tax payers? or the rich (:",2020-05-25 11:56:52

Perhaps you could help me in my ignorance but has there been someone who has come out with a description of what this improved end state looks like?

Current grouses. Too many people in one room, too few toilets, sanitation issues, what else. However it would be really useful to start being part of the solution. So how many people per square feet of bedroom space? How many to a room? What are the basic amenities? Number of sinks/toilet/shower per resident? Maximum distance between bedroom and sanitation? 

From this we can see what it does to the costs and we can also benchmark against the living conditions of non FW in Singapore (NS/one room hdb/prison).",2020-05-25 15:59:39

So I'm not sure why you are trying to paint him as someone who is on the fence and not ""committing to anything"".

That Ben Leong encourages the reader to derive their own conclusions doesn't change the fact that the primary aim of his post is to rebut Tan Meng Wah's criticism of the government's handling of covid (and Ben Leong did a pretty good job of it IMO).",2020-05-25 13:41:50

> Summary

> Boys and girls, to conclude, I would like to summarize for you the key lessons that I would like you to remember:

> (a) Data has context. It’s not simply a matter of how many infected cases a country reports. You need to understand where the data comes from and how it is obtained. The capacity limits for COVID testing means that we need to be wary about believing the data and it is not because anyone is intentionally under-reporting.

> (b) Don’t just believe what people tell you. Just because people tell you that if the dorms were better everything would be ok, you don’t just believe them. You ask why should it be? Don’t just take at face value. Just because someone has a PhD, don’t just believe him. Heck, don’t even believe me. Derive everything again by yourself from first principles.

> (c) Learn to use imagination and do thought experiments. Someone tells you, if you only  listened to me and did this, everything will be good. Well, you just happily imagine that they were right and ask yourself, then what? The problem with these big mouths who talk a lot is that they just shoot off their mouths. They have no accountability to actually do anything. They have no sense of perspective, no sense of the costs and no sense of the practical constraints.

> (d) Have a sense of perspective. We are not the only country to have massive numbers of foreign or migrant workers. I don’t believe that the living conditions of our foreigner workers are the worst in the world. Other countries have no COVID infections in their dorms or dorm-equivalents we think?

In times like this, we suck it up and wait to clean up after the mess is over. 

> On this note, all please be good. Stay home and stay safe! If you need to go out, observe safe distancing and wash your hands regularly.",">**On Testing and COVID numbers**
 
>But, before we go to the second part of this COVID saga, let’s take a brief intermission and talk about COVID numbers. I think that it’s v important for our students to learn about how to look at numbers and make sense of numbers. We have a Quantitative Reasoning (QR) module at NUS. I hope the instructors covered this example in class already. 
 
>First, the numbers are all wrong. It was obvious that the numbers coming out of China were all wrong. China was accused of under-reporting and lying about the seriousness of the situation. In fact, the chart coming out of China was surprisingly linear. Confirm fake lah!
 
>Let me tell you this. If we look at the numbers coming out of the US, I can tell you almost certainty that the numbers are also under-reported. Confirm wrong. US also under-reporting and lying about their numbers? 
 
>So, what’s the moral of the story? Everybody lies? 
 
>As it turns out, there one big choke point that few people have talked about -- that’s testing. This COVID test is not some pregnancy test. You don’t happily go out to Watsons and buy one. Good for Korea for nailing this and really ramping up the tests. But most countries struggle, including us. 
 
>There are limits to how many tests can be conducted and processed. In fact, when we say that linear looking thing coming out of China, we were likely seeing the testing capacity rather than the actual number of cases. 
 
>So how do we make sense out of this lack of data? We look at the death rates. We take the country with the lowest death rate. I suspect it’s Singapore, but people can check. We’re at 0.075%. Basically out of every 10,000 infected, about 8 die. 
 
>Let’s look at the US. They claim to have 1.65 million cases. They currently have a death rate 6%. That’s a hundred times higher than Singapore(!).
 
>While we might believe that we have a better healthcare system in Singapore. Do we believe that we are 100x better? Not possible, so what we can do is to conservatively assume that their healthcare systems are overwhelmed and 2 to 3 times worse, so it might be reasonable to assume that their actual effective death rate should be say 0.2%. 
 
>What this suggests is that the situation in the US could potentially be 30x worse that what is officially reported. With the same approach, I had estimated the total number of cases in Wuhan was likely in the 300,000 range, when it was reported to be ~60,000. 
 
>The reader is encouraged to apply this simple methodology to get a sense of how bad things are in other countries. Generally, it’s probably /*much/* worse than what’s reported.

>**How and Why did Sh*t Hit the Fan?**
 
>It was all fine and dandy. We were all having our bubble tea, as the world went into chaos. Then what happened?
 
>The methodology I used above is not rocket science. It would also be obvious to the MTF that things were rapidly going south overseas. What did we do? 
 
>We activated MFA and started evacuating our people from overseas. All our students on exchanged were recalled. Many were complaining. 
 
>As it turned out, many of these returnees were infected and we were not able to control the second wave, leading to the Circuit Breaker. 
 
>Was it a mistake to evacuate them? 
 
>I am glad that nobody suggested that we made a mistake in recalling our citizens. My view: We had no choice. We need to take care of our own. 
 
>The bigger problem obviously are the foreign worker dorms. I am surprised that Dr Tan did not say anything about this and we went on and on this usual meaningless tirade against the Government that nobody probably cares to read. Nevermind, I do the job for him. 
 
>Let’s talk about the foreign worker dorms.
 
>We have always had these NGOs, activists, dunno what, clamoring about improving conditions in the dorms, whatever lah. Generally, my impression was that we just have bunch of bleeding hearts trying to do. Good for them. Good for us. I mind my own business.
 
>However, we now have this on-going narrative, that Government was completely at fault. If only the Government had listened to them and improved the conditions for the dorms, we wouldn’t have these massive numbers of infections in the dorms. 
 
>How many people believe this? Hands up. 
 
>Very good. Put your hand down. 
 
>Boys and girls, let talk about how to reason about this claim.
 
>Suppose the Government has just listened to these NGOs. Every single one of these foreigner workers had their own single rooms with attached bathroom and sauna. Best in Singapore and Batam also. We throw in a cleaning auntie to do area cleaning for them and do their laundry. Just imagine that. 
 
>Do we believe that it would have allowed us to avoid the current problem with the foreign worker dorms? 
 
>Obviously, this would increase social distancing and *maybe* help somewhat. But guess what? The workers will still be eating together and working together. Do people understand how infectious this virus is? Even healthcare workers in full PPE can still catch it. Confirm will still kenna. Who are we kidding?
 
>Keep in mind that we would not be requiring them to wear masks -- because our own people were not asked to wear masks then. You want to discriminate against these foreign workers? 
 
>My point: all these claims that acceding to the earlier demands of these NGOs and activists would have allowed us to avoid the current foreigner worker COVID situation is hogwash. Plain and simple. 
 
>Why are we misled into thinking that it would help? Because our brains are lazy. We want easy solutions. Part of it is also the Government’s fault. The Government didn’t offer us any reason for how and why the situation imploded in the dorm. Given the lack of an alternative, people just accept what is offered, hook, line and sinker. 
 
>I think it’s despicable for these groups to try to use this crisis to advance their lobbying. This is not the time. People also please don’t repeat stupid sh*t that you hear just because people say them. Use your brain to think about whether it makes sense. 

>There is a bunch of geniuses who say that if only we didn’t have any foreigner workers, there would not be any dorms and so there would be no foreign worker dorm problem. That statement is actually completely true. I shall leave it as an exercise for the reader to analyze the feasibility and helpfulness of that suggestion. 
 
>**Root Cause of Foreign Dorm Infections**
 
>Keep in mind that we actually did have one foreign worker dorm incident even in the first wave. That was settled with military precision. People think about it. You might know that the foreign worker dorms are a risk, but if you get a case and it was handled quite easily, you would naturally think that the risk was manageable. 
 
>My hypothesis is that the real root cause for the foreign dorm infections was the humongous number of asymptomatic cases. To be fair, we always had this suspicion that there could be a small number of asymptomatic carriers. That the proportion could be up to 96(!)% was not apparent until after we had imposed the CB. By then, it was too late. 
 
>Why is it so hard for us and anyone to detect this earlier? Well, for the simple reason that there was a limited testing capacity. 
 
>If you had to choose who to test, would you choose the ones who look sick or the ones who look perfectly normal. This massive problem was likely detected when one dorm got hit and they did systematic testing in the dorms.
 
>Maybe some people expect a Government that is more omniscient. They certainly have the option to vote in a more omniscient Government at the next GE. Our Tans seem to be pretty omniscient.  :-)
 
>Personally, I would be more circumspect and forgiving about the challenges of dealing with this enemy unseen.",2020-05-25 12:47:28

> On this note, all please be good. Stay home and stay safe! If you need to go out, observe safe distancing and wash your hands regularly.","There are two components to the dorm problem which you do not clearly differentiate. One is the problem specific to COVID, which is that no special measures were taken to properly social distance the workers and ensure that adequate hygiene protocols were put into place. In my opinion, the government really dropped the ball on this one - they were quick to implement such policies for schools but did not foresee the same issue for dorms. This is what NGOs alerted them to at the onset of the crisis. However, they still failed to act on time, which is unforgivable in my eyes.

Secondly, there's a more wide ranging issue of poor conditions in dorms. This is what NGOs have been campaigning the government for years, but conditions remain poor. Nobody is asking for 5 star hotel accomodation for foreign workers, despite whatever strawman Ben Leong cooked up. However, it is undeniable that conditions are poor and fail to meet international standards. This is an issue which is only tangentially related to the dorm infections, but has been brought under the spotlight due to the infections, and rightfully so.

Nobody expects 0 migrant worker infections. But how can anyone in good conscience look at the 20,000+ infections we have now, shrug their shoulders, and say ""nothing could be done""? Much of this could be avoided, and it wasn't.",2020-05-25 12:12:49

Who are we kidding?** 

For someone who claims to know statistics well, Ben really has a very poor understanding with how infections and distancing work. From a large population standpoint, infections are **not** a ""one-and-done"" deal. Statistics is hard to understand, but let me break it down for everyone. When you social distance for 23 hours a day, just because for the last hour you have dinner with friends, it doesnt mean that those 23 hours are somehow ""wasted"". If that were the case, we would ban everyone from leaving home even for groceries. 

Instead, the **probability** of you catching the virus has been lowered through distancing. Instead of 100 social interactions a day, distancing lowers that number to 1. Now your probability of getting infected is reduced by 99%. It doesnt stay at 100% just because you had that 1 social interaction. 

Its stupid to think that the **probability** of catching and spreading the virus would still be the same just because people **work and eat together.** 

If dorms had more space, we could have reduced the probability of FWs catching and spreading the disease. On a population-level, this would translate to concrete and significant reductions in the number of people infected. Ben Leong is a joke of a prof if he cant understand simple laws of probability and chance. 

TLDR; Distance reduces the probability of getting infected and spreading infections. Taken a large population sample, this translates to actual concrete reduced numbers.",2020-05-25 13:19:02

Where it was cited that it was logistically tough to come up with temporary dorms. By the time it was set up, it was also when they found out there plenty of of asymptomatic spreaders and spreading already started. [let me know if I got the sequence wrongly]

On to point 2, I have always asked for research on foreign workers working conditions in other countries. We always say foreign workers conditions are poor in SG, what's the standards are we comparing to? When you say international standards, can you share with me some sources to this international standards? It is created by WTO? Or WHO? 

As to your last paragraph, I don't think that is what BL expressed but he pointed out that under the extereme stress and short time frame for decision-making, it is often easy to get it wrong. However just because a getting one question wrong out of 100 and we see lambasting the G saying they faired badly? Isn't that a bit unfair? It's like your kid got 99 for math and you scold him for not getting 100. Lol

By the time it was set up, it was also when they found out there plenty of of asymptomatic spreaders and spreading already started.

Didn't we only scramble to find temporary dorms after the initial explosion of cases?

> what's the standards are we comparing to?

Let's compare it to NS standards then, in which many of the older dorms or most factory-converted dorms still fail to meet it.

>However just because a getting one question wrong out of 100 and we see lambasting the G saying they faired badly? Isn't that a bit unfair? It's like your kid got 99 for math and you scold him for not getting 100. Lol

Do we assume that all mistakes are assigned the same reduction in score? Not only did the government not have the foresight (unlike our NGOs they were warning about it before) to see the risk in dorms, the fact remains that the dorm standards are below par for many of our migrant workers (again, something that the NGOs have been bringing up for years). These are valid criticisms, and yes, they've fared extremely poorly in this regard.

A better analogy would be our government getting straight As for every subject but then getting a F for one that they willfully ignored. That F would represent an outlier and an egregious failure that deserves remedy, no?",2020-05-25 14:48:50

His point here is to use your basic instincts to figure out the validity (ie someone making sense) of each arguments presented, not really about the legality. 

For example, the point he mentioned was 'if the dorms were better (of the conditions) the situation be better'. In this case, to evaluate if the argument is valid, draw on your own experiences, instincts to see if the situation is dependent on living conditions.

If you have lived in a clean environment but still got sick easily (or lived in a dirty environment but never got sick much) then your basis is that the covid situation in dorms is not necessarily dependent on living conditions.

If you have lived in a clean environment and never got sick much and then lived in a dirty environment and got sick frequently, pr vice versa, then your basis is that the covid situation in dorms is very likely linked to living conditions.

These examples and analysis show that basic instincts may not encroach into the issues of legality. 

Basic instincts don't always have to mean a right or wrong, but more on what makes more sense to the person thinking. It can be right from Person A's POV, but wrong from Person B's POV. 

Many things as derived from first principles is relative, and legality also.",2020-05-25 12:14:29

Several months ago I was in a public place of worship. We were leaving when we saw big pools of blood trails on the floor (someone had a bad cut and ran to the toilet).

People were oblivious and walking bare feet into the blood splatters and spreading them further almost reaching the sterile carpet area.

We Singaporeans have alot of ideas, and initiatives. We started to warn people and started to look for the cleaner on duty (not to be found).

Almost 15 minutes passed. One Bangladesh carpark technician (a guest there) suddenly walked over with a mop and bucket and started mopping the mess. Problem solved. We all looked on, like ... ""why didn't I think of that.""

The problem with us is, we are selective. Dirty or difficult job, we tend to 'geng' and 'siam' (outsmart and avoid). We even freeze and become lost when it comes to such calamities.

So instead of looking for the mop, we are conditioned to look for the one who is suppose to mop, and adopt a not-my-job attitude.

Life & work has taken me to many places, In the 80's I was in construction mixing with the likes of Thai's & Philipines. Their accomodation would be the actual HDB flats or carpark or posh apartments they were building.Cooking facilities were whatever were around at that time.Domestic maids were from the same countries.Weekends were usually a bit chaotic & fights were a common thing.
Then I did a bit of off shore works (Seraya island ) & by this time the likes of Bangladeshis Indians Myanmars have joined the workforce. Their accomodation is a bit better (purpose built dormitories)but the employer still had to make suprise check up on lodgings as this would make sure they play their part at keeping it up to standard.
Dont forget these guys usually work long hours & tidying up their lodgings is last thing they want to do.They usually save the housekeeping for the weekends but then social avtivities needs to happen on weekends.

So I have witnesssed a steady rise of standard but no doubt more needs to be done. Singapore being a small place n so much fast pace to the one that they are used to doesn't help the situation

"""Let's not go around pointing fingers"" - Racism at its epitome",,"I feel like the main gist of this article is to encourage the migrant workers to be more aware of personal hygiene or the government to help them become more acquainted with the process of personal hygiene. 

Of course, I see some people saying that they can't afford to clean when they're being worked to the bone, which I agree with that. However, if the conditions are to improve, but the habits that they used to live day to day don't, then the process is fruitless. 

The improvements in the conditions of migrant workers and the habits of their personal hygiene need each other for the cleanliness to be maintained.  Foreign workers work in different circumstances, and I do suppose the need of cleanliness is really emphasised when you're in close proximity to one another (as opposed to most Singaporeans who live in individual HDB flats). Singaporeans have the safety of their own quarters to avoid more spread of disease as compared to a cramped room (which hopefully should be resolved). 

Though I suppose there are some prejudices that the writer tends to have, such as the surface view that despite cleaners being hired, foreign workers don't clean up after themselves, and that they leave messes after parks (maybe some, but obviously not all), I think this was her main point. That they need the habit of cleanliness and a good environment to live in a clean environment, and that if those select few aren't trying to maintain their quarters, the rest will suffer.",2020-04-15 02:12:00

But what the article is talking about is personal hygiene in your own living space. I don't fully agree with the sentiments raised in the article but I definitely agree that the MW have to take some responsibility in how things turned out. For comparison, look to our foreign students. A lot of them live in dorms too. Yet we don't see their living spaces become so dirty and unkempt. If they know to (or perhaps are forced to by the school admin) keep their dorms clean, I'm sure the MW can do the very basic too.

This is what happens when you substitute a foreign language (and therefore culture) and pretend it's the native one. If your grandparents were ethnic Chinese born in Singapore, they almost certainly wrote in proper Chinese rather than PRC Simplified, and spoke Cantonese, Hokkien, or Teochew rather than Imperial Mandarin. When I read linguistics in uni, I read under a professor who started every single lecture (reportedly in his entire 40-plus-year career) with the declaration that

> A *language* is the *definition* of a specific *culture*, at a specific *place*, at a specific *time*. Change the culture, the place, or the time, and the language *must* change. *When* the language changes, that is *authoritative proof* that at least one of the others has, as well

(Emphasis in the original.) I've often wondered if Professor McKinley had ever spent time in Singapore; the longer I'm here (first came in '79), the more firmly I'm convinced he was calling us out with his usual discretion- and tact-enabled plausible deniability.

Foreign Employee Dormitories Act  
————————————————

Many of the issues related to some foreign dormitories which have come to the fore over the last week or so are unfortunately not new. Several NGOs had raised them over a number of years. The issue has also come up in Parliament before.

In 2015, I spoke in Parliament on the Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill that covered dormitories which housed in excess of 1000 foreign workers. I asked the Government to (i) consider building and operating foreign worker dormitories to catalyst improvements in the sector; and (ii) make investors and shareholders, not just dormitory operators, equally culpable should the living conditions of foreign workers in dormitories be deemed unsatisfactory.

 I remember MPs, including some PAP MPs going beyond the remit of the Bill to speak of foreign workers who reside in small factory-converted dorms/rooms accommodating less than 1000 workers. This was a live issue when the Bill was debated because in late 2014, a fire in a unit in Geylang that was about 1300 sq ft in size (slightly bigger than a first-generation five-room flat) - that was allegedly partitioned into 11 rooms occupied by between 88-100 individuals - caused the death of 4 workers. In another case, it was reported that two small apartments in Selegie Road had more than 50 workers who ""slept shoulder to shoulder, amid rotting food and soiled clothes"". 

 COVID-19 has shone a spotlight on the predicament of some foreign workers. We have a window of opportunity to review some issues thoroughly. Fundamentally, it is not just a regulatory review of the living conditions of foreign workers that is urgent, but more importantly, a total mindset shift towards foreign workers that is in order for some of us. Even so, it is indeed encouraging to see ordinary Singaporeans sewing masks for them and donating towards their well-being. But this advocacy and support must sustain itself after COVID-19 is defeated. 

 The sector is massive. Well in excess of half a million foreign workers – living in different types of accommodation. For some Singaporean employers, there is very little to improve. The pictures in this post highlight one example of a Singapore company, whose owner I am proud to call a dear friend. The company has instituted processes to ensure their workers are looked after. But good outcomes don’t happen automatically. Employers and supervisors must take a personal interest to ensure the well-being of our foreign workers. 

They build our homes. They clean our estates. And they do a lot more we don’t know about or will not be able to bring ourselves to do nor endure.

All foreign workers who work in Singapore deserve dignity and respect. We shouldn’t have to say this anymore.

Let me provide some examples of the conditions we will be imposing.

You can see the economic arguments already put out (MP Irene Ng is definitely worth a read); and some xenophobic undertones (see the Nee Soon MPs speeches - tldr we feel safer without them around)

We're rehearsing the same arguments again, but hopefully something moves further this time.",2020-04-20 17:01:17

Foreign Employee Dormitories Act  
————————————————

Many of the issues related to some foreign dormitories which have come to the fore over the last week or so are unfortunately not new. Several NGOs had raised them over a number of years. The issue has also come up in Parliament before.

In 2015, I spoke in Parliament on the Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill that covered dormitories which housed in excess of 1000 foreign workers. I asked the Government to (i) consider building and operating foreign worker dormitories to catalyst improvements in the sector; and (ii) make investors and shareholders, not just dormitory operators, equally culpable should the living conditions of foreign workers in dormitories be deemed unsatisfactory.

 I remember MPs, including some PAP MPs going beyond the remit of the Bill to speak of foreign workers who reside in small factory-converted dorms/rooms accommodating less than 1000 workers. This was a live issue when the Bill was debated because in late 2014, a fire in a unit in Geylang that was about 1300 sq ft in size (slightly bigger than a first-generation five-room flat) - that was allegedly partitioned into 11 rooms occupied by between 88-100 individuals - caused the death of 4 workers. In another case, it was reported that two small apartments in Selegie Road had more than 50 workers who ""slept shoulder to shoulder, amid rotting food and soiled clothes"". 

 COVID-19 has shone a spotlight on the predicament of some foreign workers. We have a window of opportunity to review some issues thoroughly. Fundamentally, it is not just a regulatory review of the living conditions of foreign workers that is urgent, but more importantly, a total mindset shift towards foreign workers that is in order for some of us. Even so, it is indeed encouraging to see ordinary Singaporeans sewing masks for them and donating towards their well-being. But this advocacy and support must sustain itself after COVID-19 is defeated. 

 The sector is massive. Well in excess of half a million foreign workers – living in different types of accommodation. For some Singaporean employers, there is very little to improve. The pictures in this post highlight one example of a Singapore company, whose owner I am proud to call a dear friend. The company has instituted processes to ensure their workers are looked after. But good outcomes don’t happen automatically. Employers and supervisors must take a personal interest to ensure the well-being of our foreign workers. 

They build our homes. They clean our estates. And they do a lot more we don’t know about or will not be able to bring ourselves to do nor endure.

> I also received many feedbacks on foreign workers driving on our roads. Many residents feel that it is too easy for foreign workers to convert their driving licence into a local one. They feel that due to the differences in driving behaviour, culture and road conditions, foreign workers should take some driving tests before they are allowed to convert their licence. This will improve our road safety.

>There are practical reasons why this is so. For example, we are aware of security concerns. We are also aware of healthcare concerns. For smaller dorms or smaller accommodation spaces, when outbreaks happen, you can manage it, you have quarantine. But when you have a much larger dorm, the requirements are quite different, the scale is very different. We need to weave this into the design of the dormitories themselves.

> Instead of just lowering the threshold, the more practical approach we believe is to add on additional requirements for dormitories above 1,000 beds. I emphasise again: existing regulations continue to be there. They continue to be important. They continue to cover a wide range of the concerns that we have today, and they will be looked at and will continue to be strengthened over time. But for the many PBDs that are going to come on line – the existing ones and the new ones – we do need these additional requirements because the scale of those dormitories is quite different. These requirements will be on top of the existing levers which will continue to apply.",2020-04-20 16:59:07

Many of the issues related to some foreign dormitories which have come to the fore over the last week or so are unfortunately not new. Several NGOs had raised them over a number of years. The issue has also come up in Parliament before.

In 2015, I spoke in Parliament on the Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill that covered dormitories which housed in excess of 1000 foreign workers. I asked the Government to (i) consider building and operating foreign worker dormitories to catalyst improvements in the sector; and (ii) make investors and shareholders, not just dormitory operators, equally culpable should the living conditions of foreign workers in dormitories be deemed unsatisfactory.

 I remember MPs, including some PAP MPs going beyond the remit of the Bill to speak of foreign workers who reside in small factory-converted dorms/rooms accommodating less than 1000 workers. This was a live issue when the Bill was debated because in late 2014, a fire in a unit in Geylang that was about 1300 sq ft in size (slightly bigger than a first-generation five-room flat) - that was allegedly partitioned into 11 rooms occupied by between 88-100 individuals - caused the death of 4 workers. In another case, it was reported that two small apartments in Selegie Road had more than 50 workers who ""slept shoulder to shoulder, amid rotting food and soiled clothes"". 

 COVID-19 has shone a spotlight on the predicament of some foreign workers. We have a window of opportunity to review some issues thoroughly. Fundamentally, it is not just a regulatory review of the living conditions of foreign workers that is urgent, but more importantly, a total mindset shift towards foreign workers that is in order for some of us. Even so, it is indeed encouraging to see ordinary Singaporeans sewing masks for them and donating towards their well-being.

Many of the issues related to some foreign dormitories which have come to the fore over the last week or so are unfortunately not new. Several NGOs had raised them over a number of years. The issue has also come up in Parliament before.

In 2015, I spoke in Parliament on the Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill that covered dormitories which housed in excess of 1000 foreign workers. I asked the Government to (i) consider building and operating foreign worker dormitories to catalyst improvements in the sector; and (ii) make investors and shareholders, not just dormitory operators, equally culpable should the living conditions of foreign workers in dormitories be deemed unsatisfactory.

 I remember MPs, including some PAP MPs going beyond the remit of the Bill to speak of foreign workers who reside in small factory-converted dorms/rooms accommodating less than 1000 workers. This was a live issue when the Bill was debated because in late 2014, a fire in a unit in Geylang that was about 1300 sq ft in size (slightly bigger than a first-generation five-room flat) - that was allegedly partitioned into 11 rooms occupied by between 88-100 individuals - caused the death of 4 workers. In another case, it was reported that two small apartments in Selegie Road had more than 50 workers who ""slept shoulder to shoulder, amid rotting food and soiled clothes"". 

 COVID-19 has shone a spotlight on the predicament of some foreign workers. We have a window of opportunity to review some issues thoroughly. Fundamentally, it is not just a regulatory review of the living conditions of foreign workers that is urgent, but more importantly, a total mindset shift towards foreign workers that is in order for some of us. Even so, it is indeed encouraging to see ordinary Singaporeans sewing masks for them and donating towards their well-being. But this advocacy and support must sustain itself after COVID-19 is defeated. 

 The sector is massive. Well in excess of half a million foreign workers – living in different types of accommodation. For some Singaporean employers, there is very little to improve. The pictures in this post highlight one example of a Singapore company, whose owner I am proud to call a dear friend. The company has instituted processes to ensure their workers are looked after. But good outcomes don’t happen automatically. Employers and supervisors must take a personal interest to ensure the well-being of our foreign workers. 

They build our homes. They clean our estates. And they do a lot more we don’t know about or will not be able to bring ourselves to do nor endure.

All foreign workers who work in Singapore deserve dignity and respect. We shouldn’t have to say this anymore.

Do you not see how ridiculous such a proposition would sit within our economic and legal model?

Even presuming that you do believe that this is a good solution for dorm management, how do you square it with the fact that culpability for malpractices or mismanagement doesn't trickle down to investors or shareholders in any other industry? Even healthcare doesn't mandate this, and you could easily argue that proper management in a healthcare context is even more vital and sensitive.",2020-04-20 20:14:22

Fundamentally, it is not just a regulatory review of the living conditions of foreign workers that is urgent, but more importantly, a total mindset shift towards foreign workers that is in order for some of us. Even so, it is indeed encouraging to see ordinary Singaporeans sewing masks for them and donating towards their well-being. But this advocacy and support must sustain itself after COVID-19 is defeated. 

 The sector is massive. Well in excess of half a million foreign workers – living in different types of accommodation. For some Singaporean employers, there is very little to improve. The pictures in this post highlight one example of a Singapore company, whose owner I am proud to call a dear friend. The company has instituted processes to ensure their workers are looked after. But good outcomes don’t happen automatically. Employers and supervisors must take a personal interest to ensure the well-being of our foreign workers. 

They build our homes. They clean our estates. And they do a lot more we don’t know about or will not be able to bring ourselves to do nor endure.

All foreign workers who work in Singapore deserve dignity and respect. We shouldn’t have to say this anymore.

Almost everyone would agree with this if they're being reasonable. A credible opposition with integrity is more effective than opposition made up of foreign linked shit stirrers. 

Just because something didn't achieve the outcome you want doesn't mean it is equally useless compared to other worse methods. Missing a 3 pointer by throwing it normally is better than missing the 3 pointer by throwing the ball at the floor.

Many of the issues related to some foreign dormitories which have come to the fore over the last week or so are unfortunately not new. Several NGOs had raised them over a number of years. The issue has also come up in Parliament before.

In 2015, I spoke in Parliament on the Foreign Employee Dormitories Bill that covered dormitories which housed in excess of 1000 foreign workers. I asked the Government to (i) consider building and operating foreign worker dormitories to catalyst improvements in the sector; and (ii) make investors and shareholders, not just dormitory operators, equally culpable should the living conditions of foreign workers in dormitories be deemed unsatisfactory.

 I remember MPs, including some PAP MPs going beyond the remit of the Bill to speak of foreign workers who reside in small factory-converted dorms/rooms accommodating less than 1000 workers. This was a live issue when the Bill was debated because in late 2014, a fire in a unit in Geylang that was about 1300 sq ft in size (slightly bigger than a first-generation five-room flat) - that was allegedly partitioned into 11 rooms occupied by between 88-100 individuals - caused the death of 4 workers.

Coronavirus: Mustafa Centre believed to be starting point for hundreds of cases,,"> # Coronavirus: Mustafa Centre believed to be starting point for hundreds of cases

> Mustafa Centre is believed to have been the starting point for hundreds of coronavirus infections at foreign worker dormitories, said the Health Ministry's director of medical services Kenneth Mak yesterday.

> The workers are likely to have been infected after visiting the shopping mall, where some employees had fallen ill. They transmitted the infection to their co-workers, who then infected others at their dormitories.

> Preliminary investigations have linked the Mustafa Centre cluster to clusters at the construction site at Project Glory and five dormitories, Associate Professor Mak said.

> These are S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, Tampines Dormitory, Toh Guan Dormitory, Sungei Tengah Lodge and Cochrane Lodge II.

> The majority of yesterday's 287 new cases were linked to foreign worker dormitories.

> Thousands of healthy workers are being moved to locations such as army camps and floating hotels, and the Government has started to actively screen and test workers for the disease.

> Four dormitories have also been gazetted as isolation areas.

> At a press conference yesterday, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo was asked if anything could have been done to avoid having to quarantine thousands of foreign workers.

> In response, she said the Government had taken steps since the start of the outbreak to engage dormitory operators and break up large gatherings of foreign workers.

> Related Story Coronavirus: Sungei Tengah Lodge is 4th foreign worker dorm gazetted as isolation area

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> ""It is not as if we have not done anything to try and manage the situation at the dorms,"" Mrs Teo added, noting that there have been no clusters in dormitories until only recently, even though a number of foreign workers had tested positive for the virus.

> ""Within dorms, workers interact with each other very regularly, very closely - they're like family, so the risk of transmission was always there,"" she said.

> Preventing clusters at dormitories would have required drastic measures involving the closure of work sites and malls, and were not easy decisions to make when the evidence at that time did not suggest they were necessary, Mrs Teo said.

> ""We couldn't have so easily said: 'Well, let's do it', when there were no similar occurrences of the clusters that we see today,"" she added. ""It's not a button that you press easily, and it is a non-trivial decision to make.""

> National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said: ""If I had known, of course, I would have done things differently - but no one can tell the next step.

> ""The reality is no one will know... if one case can very quickly spread into a cluster.""

> At present, the Government's priority is to contain the spread in dormitories for foreign workers while ensuring that their welfare is looked after, he said.

> At yesterday's press conference, Mr Wong also stressed that the disease is not a ""foreign worker issue"" and that any individual can be a weak link if he does not comply with safe distancing measures.

> ""One lapse can result in a cluster forming, so all of us have to do our part to stabilise the situation and keep it under control,"" he said.

> ""We have a responsibility for these foreign workers who have come all the way here, at considerable expense, to make a living in Singapore. So we will do our part, and we will do our very best to take care of them, and ensure their safety and their well-being.""

People were complaining about the government encouraging Singaporeans not to wear masks as it was scientifically wrong information. They claimed that healthy people had no need to wear masks, when this was clearly untrue as wearing masks does indeed protect healthy people from the virus, as evidenced by lots of scientific research.

Obviously we do indeed have a lack of surgical masks. But the government should have encouraged the usage of reusable cloth masks. That way we would be able to ensure that Singaporeans were protected from the virus while also simultaneously ensuring that there were enough masks for our healthcare workers. 

Singaporeans complaining about the government not encouraging the use of masks had every reason to complain, especially since the government’s advice went against scientific research proving masks to be beneficial even for healthy people",2020-04-10 16:51:40

It is this failure that allows these few bad actors to get away with this mistreatment, hence the 'good' employers end up with a more expensive cost base and eventually get outcompeted on projects/contracts.

The Dorms are not the problem - TWC2,,"This is a very good piece by TWC2. The whole economic doctrine need to change in SG with regards to cheap labour.

Beside the pure dignity and human rights argument I think from my observations there is no point with cheap labour. I think it damages SG. There is this idea that oh if we increase the salaries and working conditions our HDB will be more expensive etc. I dont think thats the case. How much do we even know about the man-hours spent on an HDB? How many hours is productive skilled hours? What about inefficiencies?

The addiction to cheap labour drives inefficiencies and unproductivity. Most bosses just throws more workers at the problem instead of thinking how can i solve this better this time and next time. Skills dont buildup because the workers change all the time. Workers dont have the loyalty and pride in their work. These bosses are not thinking at all how do i upskill my workforce, what machines or workprocesses should i improve etc.

In a previous job i was working with shipyards. Contracts for construction of oilrigs was basically a competition between South Korea and Singapore. 
The contract amounts was only marginally cheaper in SG than South Korea. In the end South Korea got far more projects and expanded far more than SG. It was estimate that SG spent 2-3x the manhours for the same project.

On a new construction project in an SG shipyard it’s common to see up to a thousand workers onboard at any given time by numerous different subcontractors doing their own thing. Bruteforce with lots of workers to get things done.

Going to an South Korean yard you dont see even a fifth of the workers onboard and vast majority is employees of the shipyard. Why? One reason is they thought heavily about making ship-parts modular that can be made separately without clash of workers. Main reason they had that system was the south koreans has prided themselves in competence of what they do, invested in technology and so forth. A good skilled worker also gets paid more. A skilled worker moves to improve ones worktask etc etc. Its an continuous improvement process.

Cheap labour may have had its benefit in the early days of rapid expansion of SG. But its now incredibly outdated. Productivity improvements are minimal. Why pay 1500/month(incl levies etc) for unproductive worker when we can have good skilled workers for say 2500-3000+/month. With good work conditions, technology and pay also locals will do this work same as in other countries without cheap labour.",2020-05-03 16:33:40

The Dorms are not the problem - TWC2,,"Hmm. I think sg has been pushing pretty hard for productivity drive tho, don't you think so?

But for construction and Maintenance ops, it's really difficult to push for productivity. Can send ppl for training all they want but sometimes it's just hard for employees to translate training into actual productivity increase on the ground. I think HDB tries to also push some productivity innovations to private contractors when they build HDB flats (a good portion of flats are already built using pre-fabricated parts in fact) but there's a lot of friction. BCA is pushing a lot for more use of tech in construction as well.

At the end of the day, right now at least it's a lot to do with sgprn mindset. Let's say even for yourself, if someone offered you or your friends to work as a construction supervisor that is in charge introducing govt backed digital initiatives onto the ground workers will you wanna take it up haha? I don't think many ppl would at this juncture. 


Thus, I agree that we should back off of cheap labour. But I think it's unfair to think that Govt has not been pushing hard for it. At the end of the day, a big part of all this is also really up to the private contractors and if you push them too hard they may not even want to bother working on public projects anymore or find a deluge of stringent productivity requirements too hard for them to survive. Things like FW levies have really destroyed many companies and especially for smaller sized maintenance companies.

The Dorms are not the problem - TWC2,,"I see your points but this is really a long game and we need to start somewhere. 

There was a push but recently has definitely stagnated. I mean just compare an average construction worker here and one in south korea, germany etc. Clearly there is huge rooms for improvement, why is this not happening? Beside training its the whole “lifecycle” of vocational training, respected nature of the job, pay and responsibility. I agree training wont be enough, its far deeper than that. Its a whole structural change. To change this will need very big mindset shift and right policies. Probably will take 20years minimum but need to start somewhere. SG need to get off this addiction. I mean think about it why is it that singapore, gulf states among developed countries are the only ones doing this? 

Yes there is some migrant labour due to lower cost also in other developed countries(Eg from Poland within EU) but they dont take up the majority, in sg its 99%+.

In the past you can make the argument that in order to make SG grow as fast as possible to reach first world status we took cheap labour so locals could focus on higher skilled jobs but in recent years economy has not grown that much. We already reached a very high status, among top in GDP/capita in fact. We are no longer catchup like in the past yet we see cheap labour in same way. Something is wrong here. Better be a respected construction supervisor than a jobless PMET...

Also when it comes to gov i disagree the gov is pushing hard for it. As TWC2 pointed out the rules are not being enforced properly. In addition companies tender for gov contracts. Surely gov can stipulate a minimum standard. Again need to be enforced and not just going through the motions. Gov can push a lot harder here. Just having all rules followed would make a big impact.

The Dorms are not the problem - TWC2,,"I am not exactly sure if the push has stagnated, or that it's more of just moving past the initial announcement stages. 

Of course, I agree we should always strive to push ourselves. And I guess whether or not we should push harder is difficult to say. But I think we must always consider that it takes two hands to clap, and the govt does not own all building projects in singapore. 


For example, let's take sthg like Building Info. Modelling or known as BIM(this is essentially just a software that helps digitise most information about a construction project into a shared platform). BCA has pushed out FREE training and have made it mandatory for many civil servants to attend BIM courses. But at the end of the day, BIM is akin to 3d modelling softwares or Photoshop and is not something that one can pick up part time after work. They did consider making it neccessary for contractors to submit BIM plans before, but if 90% of the contractors are unable to comply then honestly what can the govt realistically do? Literally free training has already been provided and it's not realistic to push employees to Push aside their existing workload in an already labor tight sector to learn about BIM. Plus, most of them are really much older (I'm not kidding, there seems to be so few local engineers below 30 who actually go into construction). Push too hard, take a ""I don't care you must comply"" approach and they may not even bother to apply for govt projects anymore or will be unable to adapt and close shop. 

TL;DR, I think even if we call for govt to push harder, again it's very important to realise that the govt is not omnipotent and it requires cooperation of the private sector. It's already a tight market with very little local interest, and honestly the govt is not in a good position to be too harsh when the pool of companies to select from isn't that high in the first place and pumping money, restrictions and training has (arguably) not been enough to some people's perspective. And I'm not again calls for change, but just that I feel very bad for civil servants when everyone seems to pin everything to the G when honestly it's SGprns ourselves who enter the workforce (or choose not to) and perpetuate certain inhibiting factors which is again, not their fault when most contractors/ consultants are already underpaid and overwork and are most of the time not even locals who have vested interest in the wider SG situation. Like we've literally created engineering scholarships and internship packages with VERY skewed benefits to engineers and architects that has seemed to fortunately attract some young bloods from my batch into these sectors but it's gonna take time to seem the effect. 

Btw in case it seems like I'm a govt worker, I'm not but am just sharing my opinions from an extended internship I took at the public sector.",2020-05-03 20:52:56

The Dorms are not the problem - TWC2,,"Agree takes several hands to clap. How it is viewed is a big issue and why people not attracted to it. Will be long way ahead to change this.

Issue is gov brought this on themselves. If you are a worker unhappy with your workconditions you cant protest, you cant strike. The power-balance is skewed. This is formulated in the tripartism approach. Gov is leading that, Employers and employees are very weak in this power structure. If more power was in employers hands with empowered employees that may be a better approach as they could compete more and evolve naturally instead of what gov says.

In other countries this was one avenue in which productivity was improved. Workers demanded better pay and working conditions. Employers said ok i can give you that but then you need to be able to do this project with less people. Ok says the employee but i need a machine to accomplish that. Ok says the employer and so forth.
This dynamic doesnt exist in sg therefore so much of the burden ends up on gov.
Look at the security guards and cleaner sector. Gov actively intervened there to accomplish a better outcome. Leaving it to employers and employees nothing happened due to power imbalance.

Im not so antigov in general but when it comes to the cheap labor, looking down on blue collar work etc i think they are mistaken and outdated approach.",2020-05-03 21:44:05

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 548 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Sunday (24 May) noon, bringing the total to 31,616..

> Of them, the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories, said the ministry, while three cases are Singaporeans or permanent residents.

> It added that more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of over 2,500 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tuas View Dormitory and Jurong Penjuru Dormitory.

> They are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some 400,000 foreign workers live in dorms here in Singapore.

> Some 20,000 infected foreign workers are expected to be discharged by end-May, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong at a press conference last Tuesday.

> This story will be updated later.

> With 927more cases of COVID-19 infection discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities,  a total of 13,882 cases here have fully recovered from the infection, said the ministry on Friday.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while eight are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Over 16,000 cases with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 23 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, nine others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and two whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> It had also noted that 86 male foreign workers aged 25 to 59 died due to heart disease in Singapore in 2018.

> As of 18 May, the ministry has conducted 294,414 swab tests, of which 191,260 were done on unique individuals.

> This translates to around 51,600 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 33,500 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

> The massive outbreak of coronavirus cases among migrant workers in dormitories cannot be attributed to bad living conditions alone, even if there are abysmal examples, said Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin yesterday.

> Rather, the highly contagious nature of the coronavirus and the fact that dorms involve groups of people living in close quarters are more likely to have contributed to the spread, said Mr Tan, who was Manpower Minister from 2014 to 2015.

> Speaking on the sidelines of an event for migrant worker dorms yesterday, Mr Tan said it was important not to conflate the two issues of bad living conditions and the Covid-19 pandemic, which he called a healthcare crisis of ""monumental proportions"".

> ""For example, in our universities, if the hostels remained open and the students were there, you would expect a massive outbreak to occur as well. If people are living in close quarters, given the contagious nature of this virus, outbreaks will occur,"" he said.

> Tackling questions regarding the outbreak in the dormitories, that as of yesterday has hit more than 18,000 cases, Mr Tan said it was not about ""white-washing"" cases of ""abysmal"" dorm conditions, but one should not generalise that all living conditions are as such.

> There were 741 new Covid-19 cases reported yesterday, bringing Singapore's total to 20,939.

> The living conditions of lower-paid foreign workers have been in the spotlight recently when dorms emerged as huge clusters where the coronavirus has spread. The outbreak highlighted the cramped and poorly maintained living spaces of some of these workers and their low-quality catered meals.

> On Monday, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo assured Parliament that the Government will see how housing standards for migrant workers can be further raised.

> Mr Tan said: ""It doesn't excuse (bad conditions), it is not acceptable and we need to take stringent action against those who violate the law - but it doesn't represent the whole space and that's the context that is important.

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> ""It is important to speak to the migrant workers as a whole for their lived experience to have a sense of the conditions. And given the scale and nature of this outbreak, we should not conflate the causes with these less-than-accurate generalisations.""

> When asked about the raising of dorm standards here, Mr Tan said there are things that can be improved on and the Government will be taking stock of the lessons learnt and the adjustments that need to be made.

> ""It is something that we will work on, but meanwhile, let's grapple with the (present) issues, look after our people and look after all the people who are here in Singapore who are affected in different ways,"" he said.

> During an online forum organised by the Institute of Policy Studies on Wednesday, analysts said a whole-of-society effort is needed to improve the wages and living conditions of foreign workers here.

> Not only must the Government take the lead in making structural changes, but Singaporeans, too, must change their us-versus-them mindset and take up collective responsibility, said the panellists.

"Coronavirus: Conditions in dorms not main reason for clusters, says Tan Chuan-Jin",,"You need to pay closer attention to context. What do you think people are ticked off about?

The PAP and media outlets are out in full force, insisting that they could not have foreseen the explosion in the migrant worker dorms. The actual facts are that, due to a publicly published letter, at least as of 23 March, they must have known about the potential. We know that the way things work in Singapore, issues are floated up privately first, so it is very likely that the PAP was informed earlier on. And even if they were not informed, the elite ruling class that is amongst the most highly paid leaders in the world because they themselves say they need to be the most highly paid in order to attract the best talent, *that* ruling class ought to have known. 

Instead, we get a whole lot of waffling about how this was only foreseeable in hindsight. This is what Josephine Teo [said](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/fast-teams-in-place-at-all-43-dormitories-to-tackle-situation): 

> Replying to a reporter's question on whether anything could have been done to avoid having to quarantine thousands of workers, Mrs Teo said ""it is not as if we have not done anything"" to manage the situation in dormitories.

> She recalled how stay-home notices and entry approval for workers returning from China were implemented in January and February, with inspections to make sure they obeyed the rules.

> On the decision to quarantine workers, she said: ""Given the scale and the complexity of the operations, it was never going to be a trivial decision to implement these measures, where the evidence did not previously suggest they were necessary.""

Set aside the callous, defensive, don't-blame-me attitude behind ""it is not as if we have not done anything"". 

You know what the ""standard of evidence"" was, by end February? We strongly, strongly suspected that the covid virus spreads pre- and a-symptomatically. We *knew* that some people with the disease presented with very mild symptoms. We knew that foreign workers were impacted and were being discouraged from reporting sick, because there was a directive requiring doctors to issue 5-day mandatory MC for URTI symptoms, and if your MC entitlement runs out you don't get paid. This is even without considering the kind of pressure that companies put on foreign workers to exploit them further. 

Knowing all of this, what could we have done more? 

The PAP's answer is ""it is not as if we have not done anything"". 

I do not accept this standard of governance. 

I don't even care if the PAP does not apologise. Apologising is never about saying the words ""I'm sorry"". Apologising is about, step 1, acknowledging that you have done wrong. We can't even get past this hump because The PAP Does No Wrong. 

That's why you see emotive memes like ""there is no war in ba sing se"" and ""say sorry"". They all come from a place of genuine discomfort at how the PAP handles things. Look at [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g0y4ef/gold_standard_no_more_singapores_response_to_the/), you can see where some of these objections are rooted. 

I say all of this as someone who votes PAP and who is very likely to vote PAP in the upcoming election, and who thinks the PAP has generally done a good job in this crisis.",2020-05-08 18:53:48

There’s absolutely no news about that, but residents are seeing the work done and the urgency of speed that it’s done at, it’s not hard to put two and two together.  

Well, the notice just came up today, the blocks were being refitted with basic amenities like lighting and bedding, and it’s to house the foreign workers from the dorms so that they won’t be so cramped up together. They’ve been physically working at this for at least 2 weeks, you can only imagine the logistics and planning that needed to make this happen to go further back beyond that. 

See? I told you, they government _was_ doing something but as usual they do it quietly and don’t announce it until things are more or less underway - it’s their usual practice but as usual we only react to what we know because it’s soooo much easier to stand from where we are after everything has happened and criticize every single bit they’ve done than try to understand their plans.

This was in full view in my still-in-progress-BTO group chat. When the first foreign workers contracted covid, the first comments were “will this delay our BTO?” And “do you think HDB can get new construction workers” With the circuit breaker measures, plus the major clusters, it’s just been constant moaning about how the BTO is delayed, sucks for them need to wait longer. There’s no Singaporeans first mentality. It’s very much a “I got mine, fuck you” mentality.",2020-04-07 16:25:54

Migrant Workers’ Dorms Were Always Ticking Time-Bombs. Singapore's Failure To Act Sooner Is Inexcusable.,,"Yeah it’s frustrating right?

There are a lot of worker dorms in Tuas cos of the shipyards and I really hope the virus won’t spread in there. Even before the circuit breaker measures, on any Sunday night, once you go all the way into Tuas, you’ll just see endless numbers of workers, most of whom will be lounging seated or lying down on the pavements using their phones. Imagine how cramped and stuffy their rooms are for them to prefer to lie down on the roadside pavements. 

(Source: I went in there before to distribute crowdsourced Christmas gifts as part of an initiative by ItsRainingRaincoats :))

From tomorrow onwards, with many of their work sites stopping work, it may possibly be the same scene all day every day. Hopefully it won’t be so crowded that even outside in the open air will put them at risk, especially since most of them aren’t provided masks.

But at least Mustafa will be closed for the time being. I have a feeling that it may later be discovered that Mustafa is the common link between all the worker dorm clusters.",2020-04-06 23:02:16

They will stick as many men in a room as the law allows. They will try to get away with not fixing shit when it breaks. Only the government can hold them accountable, because if the people who lives there complains, they will just show them the door.

Migrant Workers’ Dorms Were Always Ticking Time-Bombs. Singapore's Failure To Act Sooner Is Inexcusable.,,"Simplest explanation is that you don't punish a Tiger for biting a human. It's just in its nature to do so. We expect corporations to be profiteering and cutting corners whenever they can. We know that is how they behave. 

But that is why we have governments and laws. Governments job is to constrain corporations from doing bad things while allowing profits to flow. What can we people do? We have no power to riot or protest, government took those away from us. The only player here with any real power to constrain these companies is the government, not us. You literally cannot hold your pitchfork outside these dorms, you will go to jail for protesting. 

Additionally we have warned the Government many times that this has been happening. As an analogy, imagine if a murderer is running rampant in your neighbourhood. After the first murder, you can say its the murderer's fault. So you complain to the police to ask him to get caught. But the police does nothing. After the 5th or 6th murder, the neighbourhood would be faulting the police too right? And then you come along and tell your neighbours ""why are you blaming the police but dont  blame the murderer""? What can your neighbours do? 

First time it happens, can say its the dorm operators. But please la, we've known about this overcrowding and unhygienic problem for donkey years and have complained to MOM. They dont do anything about it.",2020-04-06 22:50:10
Migrant Workers’ Dorms Were Always Ticking Time-Bombs. Singapore's Failure To Act Sooner Is Inexcusable.,,"Yes definitely the dorm operators are the ones at fault for not doing proper upkeep of the premises. But sadly, you know how it is here in Sg, they’re just gonna keep with the status quo until the Govt slaps them with a warning. Cos even if the migrant workers or advocates sound out to the dorm’s building management, nothing happens. Which is why most of those who voice out about this issue (as well as other issues relating to migrant workers) direct it towards the Govt.

It’s just like how at least 10 (or more) years ago, companies that employ just a small number of foreign workers used to rent an entire HDB unit for their workers, and such “dorms” were often overcrowded as well, until HDB set down the maximum occupancy for each unit (no matter 3/4 room or bigger) to be 6. 

Back then, most worker dorms around were built and managed by the employers, usually large companies that employ a lot of workers, such as SembCorp, Keppel shipyard, etc. Those dorms usually have more amenities & facilities and generally offer a better living environment (but still cannot compare to SAF bunks la).

The rise of the external dorm operators came about after the new ruling, I believe.",2020-04-06 22:27:45
Migrant Workers’ Dorms Were Always Ticking Time-Bombs. Singapore's Failure To Act Sooner Is Inexcusable.,,"Issues were highlighted earlier though.  So it's might be considered more foresight than hindsight.

*Migrant worker NGOs have campaigned about overcrowding in dormitories for years. A 2014 medical sciences paper noted previous outbreaks of typhus and pneumonia, possibly due to dorms’ “high density” and “occasionally less than satisfactory sanitary living conditions”.*

*After the first cases in February, activists and NGOs sounded the alarm. Cai Yinzhou, the founder of Geylang Adventures, published a note with comprehensive recommendations, including decreasing the number of residents per room and earmarking dorms for suspected cases to be isolated.*",2020-04-06 14:34:57

Look at how many foreign worker NGOs have been saying the exact same things. TWC2, HOME, Migrant X Me etc. They have all consistently advocated for better living conditions for migrant workers for many many years. MOM has been dragging their feet all the while because they keep favouring company bosses.

This is not hindsight. We all knew that bosses in construction companies were cutting corners by giving these workers shitty living conditions. They knew they could do it because MOM doesnt enforce and couldnt give a flying f. Once a year maybe they will make an example by fining one company a measly sum but then its all back to business.",2020-04-06 14:46:20

Actually, I dont agree the govt has been doing a good job. Better than most, yes. But hardly fantastic. Many of the measures are reactive rather than proactive. From an economic standpoint, I think they've been brilliant. Not so much for public health.

Many doctors have been pushing for full school closure and work closure for weeks now. There have been say, quite a few lapses in logic that I wont say publicly because I dont want to be identified- the prevailing attitude among GPs is we have been gambling for the sake of our economic health- the CB is too little too late.",2020-04-06 18:58:03

>SAF bunks are quite similar; 50-100 men sharing the same toilet facilities, 10-20 men sleeping in bunks with beds separated 1-2 metres apart. However, NSFs and NSmen are probably better educated with regards to hygiene practices and precautions to be taken against the virus, and are also likely to be less clustered in general.

Hence the danger and potential for a cluster to form in camps. Also, i'm sure stand by bunks are being conducted more rigourously now but still...i wouldn't exactly trust the standards of a typical NSF haha.
However he also makes a good point that NSFs are more probably more inclined to report sick as they have less to lose. Can refer to his comment for the full details.",2020-04-06 17:59:51
Migrant Workers’ Dorms Were Always Ticking Time-Bombs. Singapore's Failure To Act Sooner Is Inexcusable.,,"Yeah I’m surprised too that people think migrant worker dorms look like SAF bunks. Anyone who has seen how an average (read: not the worst) foreign worker dorm room looks like will surely not suggest such a comparison. IMHO, when compared to foreign worker dorms, SAF bunks will easily qualify as being five star standard. Not just the aspects of cleanliness or amenities (even just the basic need of having a working toilet), though those are very important factors, but I’ll put them aside since many would assume these aspects are due to the workers not taking care or keeping clean. 

I believe the key issue behind how fast the virus can spread in worker dorms, potentially making it a “petri dish” situation, aside from the lack of cleanliness and/or hygiene in a majority of the dorms, are the issues of poor ventilation and the severe lack of physical distancing. Most worker dorm rooms would pack say, three bunk beds within the size of a bedroom in an average HDB flat (the BTO ones, not the older flats), leaving only enough room for everyone to get up and down the beds. FWIK (from being a volunteer with ItsRainingRaincoats), most of the rooms also do not have any drawers/cupboards/wardrobes/storage. Most of the workers store their belongings in their one luggage bag which they store underneath the bottom bunks of their beds.

And by the way, about the issue of cleanliness, most migrant workers do clean up after themselves, but as with all communal living, it only takes one bad apple to ruin it for everyone else. Just to quote an example, I’ve once had a housemate (I’m a room renter) who was super gross, leaving food waste and used sanitary pads lying around in the open everywhere in the house, even all over the floor of her room. 🤮 *shuddering just from recalling 😖. So no, it’s not about one’s level of education. 

P.S. The general public will likely be surprised to know that a lot of migrant workers who are working here in Singapore actually have at least a diploma from their home countries.",2020-04-06 18:20:17

Migrant Workers’ Dorms Were Always Ticking Time-Bombs. Singapore's Failure To Act Sooner Is Inexcusable.,,"I think you’re looking at it from just one perspective of healthcare but you need to remember that the government has the uphill task of balancing all sectors of the country. It’s how to balance everything with minimal effect to daily lives or minimal effort for recovery after all is over because damage is inevitable. It’s definitely not an easy task, and many people seem to glance over this point when they criticize the policies enacted. 

Sure, it’s easy to say close schools and work places. But that would have downstream effects which you need to plan for very carefully and prepare for. I think that secretly, they have been ramping up the efforts in the background without telling us exactly what they’re doing. For example the recently abandoned precinct near my place due to en bloc is now being refitted with many new facilities, with rumors that it will be a quarantine/SHN center. There’s absolutely no news about that, but residents are seeing the work done and the urgency of speed that it’s done at, it’s not hard to put two and two together.  Also when you start to look at everything from multiple angles you really start to fathom how critically complex the whole response and coordination is and that’s when you realize that the government has been many steps ahead of where they are. This is not something many people come to realize in the midst of of their criticism. So it’s easy to stand there and say “they should have done this and that” in hindsight, but it’s all people speaking from the limited knowledge they have. Granted, I do not know much too but I can understand and see why the policies and implemented the way they are. 

And to blame the government on such issues they are receiving heat for, it’s not all fair to them. At the end of the day, the government makes the policies but it is the people who enact them. We wouldn’t have needed to reach the stage of a CB if the common folk took social distancing more seriously. Look at the queues at ikea, supermarkets, etc even after the CB is announced. The government can only do so much if the people won’t listen.",2020-04-06 19:28:03

> SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed 632 new Covid-19 cases in Singapore as of Tuesday noon (May 5), taking the total count to 19,410.

> Among the new cases are nine Singaporeans and permanent residents, while migrant workers living in dormitories form the bulk of the remaining cases.

> More details will be released later on Tuesday, the ministry said.

> On Monday, MOH reported 573 new cases. Just over 5 per cent, or 16,383, of the 323,000 migrant workers living in dorms have tested positive for the virus as of Monday.

> The virus prevalence rates for work permit holders not living in dorms remains constant at 0.09 per cent, or 577 people diagnosed out of 664,000 of these work permit holders. That for Singaporeans, permanent residents and other pass holders is 0.03 per cent, or 1,229 of about 4.7 million here.

> On Monday, MOH said the number of new cases, excluding work permit holders staying inside or outside dorms, has decreased from an average of 20 cases a day two weeks ago to nine in the past week.

> The number of unlinked cases in this group has also fallen from a daily average of 12 cases two weeks ago to four in the past week.

> The number of new cases among work permit holders not staying in dorms has also decreased. The daily average was 22 cases two weeks ago, compared with 13 in the past week.

> As of Wednesday, 1,452 patients in Singapore have fully recovered from the virus and been discharged.

> Eighteen have died from Covid-19 complications and five who tested positive have died from other causes.

> Globally, the outbreak, which began in December last year, has infected more than 3.58 million people. Some 250,000 have died.

We can do both. The dorms aren't going to be a similar transmission environment to the rest of society and it's disingenuous to fold them into the other cases, just as it was disingenuous to fold the Diamond Princess into Japan's cases. 

It's good that we're seeing a drop in local transmission. Hopefully this continues. Hopefully our measures are working. It's bad that we're seeing a lot of cases emerging from the dormitories. There's definitely a great deal of infection risk there, so hopefully the mitigation factors (e.g. transferring those who test negative out) will start kicking in soon. Some of this might be a function of the fact that they have been focusing fire on testing in the dormitories. Hopefully they all get the care they need.",2020-04-18 16:25:11
942 NEW CASES OF COVID-19 INFECTION,,"In theory, they could keep the dorms gazetted as isolation areas, I think, despite lifting the local lockdown. But the isolation area thing was meant to last for 14 days so they should be coming out at roughly the same time as us.

> SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed 573 new Covid-19 cases as of Monday noon (May 4), taking the country's total count to 18,778.

> Among these are five Singaporeans and permanent residents, while migrant workers living in dormitories continue to make up the bulk of the remaining cases.

> More details will be released later on Monday, the ministry said.

> Over the weekend, the Government announced plans to ease some of the tighter restrictions put in place during Singapore's circuit breaker, but said that these measures - which were due to end on Monday - will continue for another week.

> Some businesses, such as barbers, home-based businesses and laundry services, will be allowed to progressively open from May 12, although they still have to abide by precautions put in place earlier. For instance, hairdressers can offer only haircuts.

> This comes as some governments across the world begin or mull over plans to ease curbs in order to restart their economies, amid concerns that such moves could backfire and cause spikes in virus cases.

> Portugal, for instance, ended its state of emergency over the weekend, while Spain is allowing restaurants to reopen for takeaways and adults to exercise on the streets.

> Singapore's Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said on Saturday that the country has to adapt and adjust its solutions ""cautiously and gradually"".

> ""And as we do this, we need everyone to cooperate, so that we can open up the economy and resume normal activities safely without causing further clusters to form,"" he said at a multi-ministry task force briefing.

> There were 657 new coronavirus cases on Sunday.

> MOH said 15,833 of the 323,000 migrant workers living in dormitories - 4.9 per cent - have tested positive for the virus. In contrast, 569 migrant workers not living in dorms, as well as 1,224 Singaporeans and permanent residents, have been diagnosed with the virus.

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> The virus prevalence rates for migrant workers not living in dorms, and that for Singaporeans and permanent residents, are 0.09 per cent and 0.03 per cent respectively.

> MOH said on Sunday that new community cases among Singaporeans and PRs, as well as long-term pass and work pass holders, fell from an average of 21 daily cases two weeks ago to 11 in the past week. This excludes work permit holders who are not living in dormitories.

> The number of unlinked cases from this group has also dropped from a daily average of 13 to five over the same period.

> As of Sunday, 1,404 patients in Singapore have fully recovered from the virus and been discharged.

> Eighteen people have died from Covid-19 complications and four who tested positive have died from other causes.

> Globally, the outbreak, which began in December last year, has infected about 3.5 million people. About a quarter of a million people have died.

> The United States is the worst affected country in the world with more than 1.1 million cases and 66,000 deaths from Covid-19 as of Monday.

Some will say that these are work permit holders (likely supervisors) that earn slightly more, and thus don't need to live in dorms. If they live in HDBs, then they should be considered 'community', but at the same time, it's likely that if they were to get infected, it would be from their workplace, and not from elsewhere.

That being said, the article specifically uses the wording '569 migrant workers not living in dorms'; given the context, this would imply workers holding work permits, but at the same time, is ambiguous, and could include workers that hold other work visas (SP, EP, PEP)",2020-05-04 15:51:43

Infection risks within a dorm is due to the close proximity, shared facilities and all that. 

Work permit holders not residing within a dorm are not (or are ideally not) exposed to these risks. Hence why are are counted separately from the ones in dorms.

Additionally, they are unlikely to require relocation of living spaces so it's just easier to have an overview of the situation when you isolate the numbers specifically for dorms.

"573 New Covid-19 Cases Reported, total cases at 18778 [04 MAY 2020]",,"There are a lot of places [where work permit holders can live](https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/housing/various-types-of-housing). Some we don't normally think of, such as ""construction temporary quarters"" and ""temporary occupation license"". Only Malaysians and work permit holders in the services and manufacturing sectors are allowed to live in HDBs. Construction workers are not. The services and manufacturing work permit holders can only come from Malaysia, China, HK, Macau, South Korea, and Taiwan.

The vast majority of Singapore's cases are the intersection of three groups: construction workers, dorm-residents, and (unfortunately) Bangladeshi and Indian foreign workers. Most cases fall in all 3 groups; it's like a Venn diagram of 3 circles that mostly overlap. But there are, for example, PRC and Myanmarese construction workers who are dorm-residents who got it. 

Common sense suggests that most of these non-dorm WP holders are either construction workers (got it from colleagues) or Bangladeshi/Indian foreign workers (got it from friends), rather than completely new clusters of HDB-renters, as most people are imagining.

The MOH report on the 30th, when there were quite a lot of non-dorm WP cases, notes ""**The vast majority of these cases are workers in the construction sector serving their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) requirements**.""

 One such non-dorm WP cluster is [234 Balestier Road](https://mothership.sg/2020/04/covid-19-update-april-15-4-clusters/) (shophouses). There were 11 cases linked to this cluster when I last looked, and the article gives the bios of 6 of them (4 Bangladeshi males, 1 Indian, 1 Thai). It's a pretty shitty looking place to live, and there are other foreign workers crammed into similarly dismal places, probably places where SC/PRs don't want to live. There may be illegally housed workers in the cases too.",2020-05-04 16:33:39

Where they got infected from is besides the point. It's who they can potentially infect that is the concern. For FWs living in dorms, they kenna infected in dorms and in turn infect others in dorms. That is manageable. But for infected FWs who dont live in dorms, they can potentially infect everyone near their home and on their daily commute to work.",2020-05-04 16:35:48

What % of tests so far are of foreign workers in dormitories? If a foreign worker tests positive, and they test the whole dormitory complex, naturally the cases are going to skew towards foreign workers.

Not saying there aren't lots of foreign worker cases, but it doesn't preclude that there are lots of non foreign workers where there just hasn't been testing resources thrown at those populations.

For some more recent research, ~5% of the Danish population was found to be infected despite low case numbers, through random sampling at blood donation centers.

Arguable. At the start, before this community spread, the containment was targeting close contacts. If it is only spreading within dorms, containing only the dorms would be the logical approach.

Coronavirus: 21 vacant HDB blocks in Bukit Merah being refurbished to house essential foreign workers,,Great news!,2020-04-08 15:39:11
Coronavirus: 21 vacant HDB blocks in Bukit Merah being refurbished to house essential foreign workers,,"imagine you're a foreign worker task to refurbished for another worker, and return to your own dorm with terrible conditions",2020-04-08 16:30:24
Coronavirus: 21 vacant HDB blocks in Bukit Merah being refurbished to house essential foreign workers,,"I live nearby. I mentioned it in one of my previous post a few days ago. 

Honestly, I’m glad they’re doing this because we know that special times call for special needs. We also know that these blocks were going to be torn down and were kind of sad cos they’re an icon of the neighbourhood but efforts to save them went unheard. So it’s kind of nice that these blocks can have a final lease of life before they’re gone. 

As a nearby resident, my worry was that if they bring the virus over from the dorms, it’s too close to home. At the very least there needs to be a proper barrier from the residential communities (I know, this sounds like putting them in jail but hear me out). These blocks are right next to elderly rental flats, home of the most vulnerable group of people in this COVID crisis. It’s also right next to Redhill market, where many elderly come from other neighborhoods even to do their daily grocery shopping. It’s also literally 3 minutes away from the MRT station. My worry is that if they don’t follow the rules of lockdown, spreading the virus around the neighbourhood would have dire consequences given the average aged population here. 

Which is why I’m glad to see that the authorities have set up a barricade around the blocks so that the entry and exit points are limited and more importantly, controlled. It’s not ideal but it’s a compromise I think we all have to accept in special times like these. From what I understand, They are still able to come out of the residences to make essential purchases so they are not say utter lack of freedom like a convict. They have to follow lockdown rules like the rest of us so we are as much a convict in our own homes as they are.

So ya, to address some of your concerns (specifically the downvotes guy who talked about property prices and deleted his comment while I was typing reply to him so I’m reposting this as a parent comment instead), most residents here are understanding enough to know whats going on and we applaud this measure taken. We know it’s only short term, and we care less about property prices and more about the virus spreading as new elements are introduced in the neighbourhood and we don’t know for sure how things will play out. 

Ps: they’ve been working on this for weeks now, so please do give the govt some credit here. They did not as some have claimed, do nothing for the dorm workers, but instead have been working quietly in the background until things are up and and running before they announce it. I can assure you first hand based on the massive effort and how long they took to refit the place, that **they’ve been working on this waaaaayyy before the recent clusters at the dorms broke out (less the initial cluster at S11 at Seletar).** In fact, they’ve only moved in two days ago to the first few flats which are ready, they’re still working on the other blocks in the precinct at this very moment. That’s how massive this whole project is.",2020-04-08 17:21:26

> SINGAPORE - Some 21 vacant Housing Board blocks in Bukit Merah are being refurbished to house healthy foreign workers working in essential services, the Ministry of National Development (MND) has said.

> The workers will start to move into the three-room flats progressively as works are completed in the coming weeks.

> MND said in response to queries from The Straits Times on Wednesday (April 8) that the affected blocks had earlier undergone the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme, which buys back from residents public housing sitting on land with high redevelopment potential for other purposes.

> The flats were vacated in 2018 but not yet demolished.

> With foreign dormitories becoming a source of concern for the spread of the coronavirus in recent days, an inter-agency task force has been set up to, among other things, ensure that any disruption to essential services is minimised by having workers in these industries housed separately.

> The foreign workers who are expected to move into the Redhill Close flats work in areas such as cleaning and maintenance.

> In a notice to residents in the area on Monday, Minister of State for Social and Family Development Sam Tan said that the dormitories of the workers slated to move in have not been spared from Covid-19.

> Housing them separately will ""keep them safe from the disease, which will in turn keep us safe when they are working in our midst"", said Mr Tan, who is also Minister of State for Foreign Affairs.

> He also assured residents that just like the rest of Singapore during the ""circuit breaker"" measures, which began on Tuesday, the workers will remain in their flats except to travel to work using company transport or to buy essentials.

> Police and Certis officers will be deployed to maintain order at these blocks.

> ""Let's show our support to these workers by welcoming them during this difficult period,"" he added.

> The Straits Times has contacted MND for more information.

My thoughts:

New cases would not be stabilized until

* the number of untraced cases from the reporting day drops to a low number, arbitrarily speaking 50 or less
* the number of untraced cases from the past few days (backlog) drops
* most of the cases involving work pass holders appear in 2 clusters, 1 for workplace, 1 for dorm

In a sense, due to circuit breaker, all work pass holder cases + their dorms + their workplaces are ""contained and monitored"" as 1 mega cluster.

Assuming the govt's efforts to contain works well, we should be concern with non-work pass holder cases + non-dorms cases.",2020-04-14 21:17:54

> Eight have died from complications due to COVID-19 infection, including a 90-year-old Singaporean man who succumbed to the disease on Saturday.

> At least 17 clusters linked to foreign worker dormitories have been identified thus far, including the largest cluster at S11 Dormitory@Punggol, which is linked to 365 cases.

> Eight such dorms have been gazetted as isolation areas, including the newly confirmed cluster at Acacia Lodge and Cochrane Lodge II.

> As of 7 April noon, 72,680 swab tests have been carried out, of which 47,486 of them involved unique individuals. 

> The COVID-19 Temporary Measures Act, passed in Parliament on Tuesday, gives authorities the power to ban events and gatherings, or impose conditions on how they are conducted, during the “circuit breaker” period lasting till 4 May.

> Those caught flouting these regulations will be fined $300 and subsequently face prosecution for repeated offences.

> Under the Act, the penalty for first-time offenders is up to a $10,000 fine, a jail term of up to six months, or both. For second-time or subsequent offenders, the penalty is a fine of up to $20,000 along with a possible jail term of up to a year.

> People who flout their five-day medical leave or stay-home notices and do not wear masks if they have to leave their place of accommodation to seek emergency medical treatment are also subjected to similar penalties.

> Part of the “circuit breaker” measures – announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last Friday – include the closure of schools and most workplaces. Only essential services like food establishments, markets and supermarkets, transport, and key banking services will remain open during the month-long closure.

> In a Good Friday address, Lee reiterated his call for Singaporeans to stay home, as COVID-19 cases continue to rise in foreign worker dormitories as well as in the general population.

> Over the weekend, the authorities issued a slew of measures, including the closure of beaches, facilities in parks and gardens and playfields.

> Wearing masks was also made compulsory for commuters on public transport, as well as while those visiting supermarkets, convenience stores, pharmacies, and shopping malls.

> Stadiums have also been closed, while parents are not allowed to drop off their children with grandparents on a daily basis.

At no point did I suggest they were all living in squalor. All I am suggesting is that given the increased proximity of dorm living compared to the average Singaporean (whether ""excellent condition"" or ""squalor"") means that the covid infection rate amongst them is higher. This is evidenced by the increasing number of dorms being termed ""isolation areas""- so far, there are 18. Unless you are making the claim that all ""isolation"" areas are squalid  and the rest are fine and as likely to facilitate covid infection as any other party of Everyday living (which, by the way, is at some odds with your point that they are not all living in squalor), I think we can agree dorms are worth the government attention at the moment.",2020-04-23 12:15:41

2) The migrant workers are at fault for ignoring the rules?

My core claim remains unrefuted- that the dorm problem, by virtue of being the covid problem, affects Singaporeans, and hence is deserving of our tax money. If the situation calls for more money and attention, it should get it if it helps the dorm problem. I don't think I need to provide a full breakdown of where funds should go to make that point understandable. If my failure to do so makes you think this point is invalid, then I concede that it is invalid.

If you are of the belief that dorms which satisfy social distancing protocol are akin to those living in HDB in terms of covid risk, I don't know what to tell you. Look at pictures of foreign dorms - even the government-approved ones - they are nowhere near HDB level of distancing. I am not saying all dorm Operators are flouting the rules: I am saying following the rules still make them the most prone.

1) implement social distancing in dorms that pass standards,

2) Rehouse workers across the island in HDBs, army camps, newly constructed tentages, and etc.

The justifications provided by NGOs have always been on the basis of emotional appeals, regarding how migrant workers have came from far away to work on our infrastructures and other essential services, and they argue that in itself means they deserve better housing. So I ask: At what point is enough? Why is THIS extent not enough?

To be clear: The onus of responsibility is on them and everyone else who keeps making those claims. 

Again I'll say it: I appreciate the severity of the problem, but I don't see evidence for (1) why MORE resources should be given, and (2) to what extent are we supposed to help. Since you and so many others keep echoing that same claim even now, then provide your evidence and the rationale behind that.

You (and so many others like you) keep insisting that we are the ones who must come up with counter-arguments, even when this much resources are already committed across the nation. Why is the onus on us? Why are we not doing enough?

Since you argue that such social distancing measures are not enough, then are you going to be satisfied only when every single worker has their own individual housing in Singapore? I've already said that dorm operators that follow social distancing protocols can effectively maintain sufficient controls. Since you said these rules are not enough, then what should the ministry of health and manpower both change the rules to? Are you saying even army camps are not good enough, since there are 12-man and 16-man arrangements? By extension, are you saying the Ministry of Defence has not lived up to its duty and have neglected our conscripted citizens? Again, to what extent are you going to call for more resources?

Quibbling over individual policies (and demanding for new alternatives that even the government hasn't figured out yet) is besides the point. The genesis of the argument is that you think government is placing too much emphasis on the dorm problem. I have told you why that is not the case - because the dorm problem IS the Singapore covid problem. 

Your comments seems to suggest the current measures taken on the dorm problem are considered ""enough"" - have they been?The cases have increased exponentially. The first isolation areas were gazetted on April 5, 18 days ago. Given the suspected incubation period is 14 days, does it seem like they are ""enough"" to contain the spread? I personally do not feel so.

Let me note here that I do not blame the government. I believe that they are, in good faith, doing their job to the best of their ability. I am merely positing that they should continue undertaking all that is necessary to curb the dorm problem. You are the one suggesting they should do less.

> SINGAPORE - Cruise ships are being assessed for their feasibility as temporary housing for foreign workers who are recovered from Covid-19 and tested negative for the virus.

> SuperStar Gemini and SuperStar Aquarius, mid-sized cruise ships operated by Genting Cruise Lines, will be checked for consideration by the Government for factors such as ventilation systems, security protocols and infection control measures.

> If deemed feasible, the two cruise ships may be used to complement other interim facilities such as Singapore Armed Forces military camps and vacant Housing Board blocks that have been refurbished to house healthy workers.

> By reducing numbers of workers in existing dormitories, health measures can be implemented more effectively, said the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in a media statement on Friday (April 17) morning.

> Cruise ships are being considered for use as temporary housing as they have readily available rooms and en-suite toilets to minimise person-to-person contact, added STB.

> SuperStar Gemini, which arrived from Hong Kong on Friday, is berthed at Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore. SuperStar Aquarius may be activated for assessment at a later date.

> If deemed suitable, the two ships may accommodate up to 2,000 foreign workers in total.

> STB said that ""if activated, every effort will be made to uphold the health, welfare and security of foreign workers on board the ship, where they will be expected to observe the highest standards of safe distancing at all times"".

> Foreign workers would also be allowed scheduled outdoor time on the vessels and would be provided with wireless Internet access.

> Related Story Coronavirus: 3 more foreign worker dormitories declared isolation areas

> Related Story Coronavirus: Floating facilities ready to house healthy foreign workers

> While the spread of the coronavirus in the wider community has held steady over the past two weeks, the number of cases linked to foreign workers in dormitories has risen exponentially.

> As of Friday morning, the total number of foreign workers linked to dorms who have tested positive for Covid-19 is 2,689, which is about 60 per cent of all Singapore's cases.

> There are now a total of 12 dormitories declared as isolation areas where workers at these lodgings must be quarantined in their rooms for 14 days.

Coronavirus: Cruise ships assessed for feasibility to temporarily house healthy foreign workers,,"Came here to say, this will not help and it’s such a terrible decision.  
  
I know our Frontlines in charge of Covid containment is overwhelmed with work but this has to be said:  

**Edit: ignore the first 3 points. Cruise for recovered FW.**  
1.They will do swap test first on those being relocated to these cruise- **but tests are known to have turn out negative initially** so they can still be infected.
   
2.These FW aren’t fully quarantined, **they are still going to work**.  
(Another concern, are we asking FW to continue wearing mask throughout work? again, if not then it’ll obviously be more likely to spread Covid. Perhaps their work already requires them to wear a mask idk.. I’ll just point this out so anyone in the know can work it out so no FW faints doing  labour work because of a suffocating mask whole day.)
   
3. Bad publicity worldwide. Once an outbreak occurs on this cruise(unless it’s contained very well, which is just betting ur luck.)
   
4. We should be applying lockdown for all FW living in crowded/shared dorm for at least 14days to make sure our healthcare doesn’t get strained more.
   
5. Imo, It makes no sense to let our FW continue work during this CB and Dormitory spike. We should solve the crowded dorm issues first, since we currently have community spread going on we shouldn’t react as if FW bringing Covid back to temporary dorm or causing further spread in community isn’t likely. 
   
My suggestion: I don’t know the capacity our country can do to house as many of them separately. But if surveillance is an issue, we can make mid shift shelters and get general public to help monitor via camera(we report to authorities if anyone try to sneak out) hopefully this will help slow the spread and we can get some breather for our frontlines.  
(For the sake of everyone, We will have to endure and work together if rubbish and cleaning or other essentials done by FW is disrupted.)
   
Before *you* start flaming aimlessly. Lockdown and surveillance means, **temporary** build a fenced shelter/tents for few weeks so the dormitory issues doesn’t turn tragic(we will only monitor the fences to make sure no one flout).

Edit: just realised it was for recovered FW, heard on TV and saw the comments hence I didn’t check the article first sorry. But some of my points can be considered.

This is confusing though: 
>The STB said: ""If activated, every effort will be made to uphold the health, welfare and security of foreign workers on board the ship, where they will be expected to observe the highest standards of safe distancing at all times.""

>Foreign workers would also be allowed scheduled outdoor time on the vessels and would be provided with wireless Internet access.

If they are recovered why do you expect them to observe safe distancing?",2020-04-18 11:27:32

Will regulation always cause costs to be passed on to the consumer?,"A hot topic of late is how migrant worker dorm operators will simply increase costs to the consumer if government regulation is introduced to improve the living conditions of migrant workers.

Average profit margins for large construction firms are 1.5-2% globally. Dorm operators enjoy considerably higher margins but they are often squeezed heavily by the main construction firms due to the aforementioned thin margins. 

In such a thin margin business, price increases are almost always passed on to the consumer. The competition in this industry is also nowhere near as intense as some of other large regulated industries (e.g. banks); and this further diminishes the bargaining power of consumers vis a vis companies.

Finally, as much as people demand better conditions for workers, most of us fail to put our money where our mouth is. Think of the sweatshop scandals from big firms like Apple, H&M, Nike etc. For all the feel-good ""demands"" for better worker conditions - people continue to purchase these companies' goods despite their perpetuation of these practices. Consumers need to vote with their dollars in terms of being willing to pay more for more ""ethically produced"" goods and services, not just their mouths - only then will things change.",2020-05-18 18:32:56

If all that profit (before payroll) goes to just the owner, then that’s a lot of money. In some ways, this is characteristic of construction, given that other than the owner, everyone else in a construction company earns peanuts.

In comparison, take a high-skill industry like consulting. Profit margins before payroll deductions are considerably much much higher since all they pay for is office space and office equipment. But their workers earn a lot more. Experienced consultants easily earn 10k and upwards. So the owner of a small local consultancy which has a much higher profit margin can be earning much less given the spread of his profits.",2020-05-18 19:51:33

1. The top brass (around 3pax) takes a lot of pay (a few million annually per person). The level below takes around a few hundred thousand to half a million per person.
2. Clearly they can afford to take a paycut (just for reference, around 2% is standard for downturns) to treat their workers just a bit better (eg cater better food, etc).
3. The question is why don't they do it?
4. It's because individuals in the company have to overcome the inertia of the many parties involved in order to even raise such a decision. Businesses are not dictatorships. 
5. In other words, there needs to be a convincing enough impetus. A business case for doing so, if you will. If not, a convincing reason beyond ""some people online are making noise"". (eg New blood in the leadership who wants to ""shake things up"")
6. Elsewhere, this comes in the form of union pressure or customer dollar votes (which are not applicable to this industry because the contractors are B2B, so laypeople opinions don't impact them)
7. Governments' hands are also tied (you might doubt this, but it's true). They can provide a slight 'nudge' in the form of regulations. BUT it needs to be quantifiable and objective to avoid loopholes and setting a bad precedent.
8. However, when a concept is inherently debatable, there will be endless protests from business owners who will just seek to muddy the waters. eg. How do you create a compelling case for why one definition of ""decent living conditions"" is the best definition?

At the end of the day, government interference in the free market is always a carefully calculated decision, because there are more factors at play than the layperson would often care to consider.",2020-05-19 01:02:51

Will regulation always cause costs to be passed on to the consumer?,"A hot topic of late is how migrant worker dorm operators will simply increase costs to the consumer if government regulation is introduced to improve the living conditions of migrant workers.

Following new regulations Dorm A passes extra costs on the the consumers by increasing prices, while Dorm B absorbs the costs and their prices remain the same.

If it is really the case that there is no other way to improve their living condition other than increasing housing prices or tax funded subsidies, then so be it. The government should explain clearly how much the increased regulation is likely to cost and impose the regulation anyway. A lot of things increase businesses costs, including foreign worker levy. But we still do it because the benefits are worth it. This is the same. We are one of the richest countries in the world. We can afford to let foreign worker live in more humane conditions without bankrupting our country.

"COVID-19: Singapore confirms 611 new cases, total at 33,860",,"> # COVID-19: Singapore confirms 611 new cases, total at 33,860

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 611 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Friday (29 May) noon, bringing the total to 33,860.

> Of them, the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories, said the ministry, while three others are Singaporeans or permanent residents.

> It added that more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> This story will be updated later.

> MOH’S STATEMENT IN FULL

> From Monday, the MOH will publish a list of locations visited by cases in the community for over 30 minutes. This list – which excludes residences, workplaces, healthcare facilities, and public transport – will be updated on a rolling 14-days basis or one incubation period, the ministry said.

> As a precautionary measure, the MOH advised those who had been at these locations during the specified timings to monitor their health closely for 14 days from their date of visit.

> They have also been urged by the ministry to visit the doctor if they develop symptoms such as cough, sore throat, as well as fever and loss of taste or smell, and inform the doctor of their exposure history.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of over 2,600 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tuas View Dormitory and Jurong Penjuru Dormitory.

> The four are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some 400,000 foreign workers live in dorms here in Singapore.

> Some 20,000 infected foreign workers are expected to be discharged by the end of this month, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong at a press conference on 12 May.

> With 1,018 more cases of COVID-19 infection discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, a total of 18,294 cases – more than half of the total infections here – here have fully recovered from the infection, said the MOH on Thursday.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while seven are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Apart from 23 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, nine others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and two whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> It had also noted that 86 male foreign workers aged 25 to 59 died due to heart disease in Singapore in 2018.

> As of 25 May, the ministry has conducted 334,691 swab tests, of which 218,996 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 58,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 38,400 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

>There is an increase today in the number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside dormitories. **The vast majority of these cases are workers in the construction sector serving their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) requirements.**  

There are construction workers who live outside dorms. Note that non-Malaysian construction workers are not allowed to rent HDBs. But construction workers can be housed in temporary quarters near/in construction sites, and in private housing (typically run-down units above shophouses). Some may also be housed illegally in warehouses and commercial buildings that aren't official factory-converted dorms. I personally think that MOH is being kind of evasive about this because some of the non-dorm WP cases were being housed illegally and they don't want to air even more dirty laundry.

If the justification for separating the dorm workers is because they do not interact with the community today, and therefore do not spread the virus to the general population, then we should exclude the old folks home too. 

The statistics is not about whether you feel they are part of the Singapore community but HOW THE VIRUS IS SPREAD. Whether they stay Long time or go back home after work you think the fucking virus will give a shit?",2020-05-03 17:47:48

> SINGAPORE — All 43 purpose-built foreign workers dormitories here will soon be “effectively” on lockdown, affecting some 200,000 workers.

> During a virtual press conference led by the COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce on Tuesday (14 April), Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said that the authorities aim to apply the same safe distancing measures implemented in isolation areas to the remaining dorms.

> Thus far, eight dorms have been gazetted as isolation areas, with the latest being Cochrane Lodge II.

> “While these (other) dorms are not presented as isolation areas, we aim to apply the same safe distancing measures so that they are effectively also on lockdown,” said Teo.

> Some 7,000 healthy workers who are providing essential services have already been moved out of the dormitories.

> They would be placed at various activated sites such as SAF military camps, the Changi Exhibition Centre, floating hotels, or floatels, that are typically used for offshore accommodation, as well as vacant Housing Board blocks in Tanjong Pagar and Jurong.

> About 1,300 healthy workers will be progressively relocated in batches to three floating hotels berthed at Tanjong Pagar Terminal over the next few weeks. The first batch of 31 healthy workers have been moved to a floatel.

> At least 19 clusters linked to foreign worker dormitories have been identified as of Monday night, including the largest cluster of 586 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol.

> Those linked to S11 account for nearly half of the total 1,193 cases linked to clusters at foreign worker dorms and construction sites.

> On Tuesday, the Ministry of Health’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak said there were another 334 new cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore, taking the total to 3,252.

> A forum letter published in Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao that linked the Covid-19 outbreak in dormitories to foreign workers' personal hygiene and living habits showed racism and deep insensitivity, Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam said yesterday.

> The letter, published on Tuesday, also showed a lack of understanding of why there has been Covid-19 transmission in Singapore's foreign worker population, he added.

> While the average number of cases in the local community has stayed stable in recent days, the number of cases in dormitories has soared to the hundreds and now forms the majority of new cases.

> This is primarily due to communal living and is not just a question of personal habits, Mr Shanmugam told Zaobao.

> ""Personal habits are extremely important: washing of hands, keeping yourself clean,"" he said.

> ""But when you put people together, when they sleep in the same room, they cook together and they are in close proximity over a long period of time, of course there will be high levels of transmission, just like we know (there are) also transmissions in households.""

> Instead of pointing fingers, Singaporeans should be coming together to take care of the foreign workers here, he added, as he credited them for helping to build Singapore's Housing Board flats and infrastructure and keeping the country clean.

> ""Our duty as Singaporeans, really, is to show them empathy and take care of them,"" he said. ""I don't think this is the time to say it is their own fault.""

> He noted the Singapore community has mobilised to help foreign workers here, while the Government has stepped in to ensure they continue to receive their salaries, medical care and daily meals.

> ""All of these gestures - I'm not sure that many other countries are doing it - are really to assure the foreign workers that they are not just locked down in their dorms and left there to fend for themselves without any idea of what's going to happen to them,"" he said.

> ""That's not the way.""

> In the letter, forum writer Lee Shiwan had asked if foreign workers should not themselves be held responsible for the outbreak in the dormitories, given that they ""like to gather and do not pay attention to personal hygiene"".

> Ms Lee had also said many foreign workers came from backward countries and brought with them ""habits such as eating with their hands and eating under trees"".

> Lianhe Zaobao said in a statement that its letters pages publish a diversity of views, and the opinions of contributors do not represent the newspaper's position.

> A day before publishing the letter, the newspaper ran stories about the conditions of foreign worker dormitories here and the need to include them in the battle against Covid-19, said Zaobao's forum editor Yap Pheng Hui.

> ""The intention of Zaobao in publishing the (letter) was to present a differing opinion so readers would be able to appreciate the diversity of viewpoints in society,"" he said.

> Mr Yap noted that most of the letters the newspaper has received to date were against the position taken by Ms Lee, and have ""provided well-reasoned rebuttals against the position put forth in the original article"". The original letter had thus allowed for robust debates and allowed ""a wider audience to reflect upon and understand the impact of the pandemic"".

> Related Story Rajinikath, Sachin Tendulkar share messages of encouragement for foreign workers in Singapore

> ""Zaobao believes that it is through the diverse mediums of readers' letters, opinion pieces and investigative pieces by journalists that our society draws ever closer to the truth,"" he said.

> Mr Shanmugam, who found the letter xenophobic, stressed it is possible for 57 per cent of Singaporeans to be professionals, managers, executives and technicians, or PMETs, because foreign workers form the base of the economy.

> They, therefore, help build Singapore's prosperity and should be better appreciated, he said.

> He also said Singaporeans are kind, compassionate and generous people. ""We are bigger than the sentiments expressed in that letter.""

"Coronavirus: after Little India riot, Singapore promised migrant workers decent housing. What happened?",,"
The actual reporting is good. The guidelines for purpose built dorms were made in response to the riots. But the standards are clearly not strict enough or not enforced. Forget about facilities. The number of residents per sq ft of sleeping area, the ratio of stoves, toilets, showers and sinks to residents, is it enough?

According to Speak for Climate, The current building code says that “A minimum of 4.5sqm Gross Floor Area of living space per worker shall be provided”. This minimum standard is 6 times lower than the average living space per Singaporean of 27 sqm.

The current environmental health guidelines for dormitories are 1 water closet, 1 urinal, 1 wash-hand basin, and 1 shower room for every 15 workers. This standard is close to 3 times worse than the International Labour Organisation (ILO)’s recommendation of a minimum of 1 toilet, 1 wash basin and 1 shower for every 6 persons.

Edit: of course I don't think we should match 27 sqm. But 6 times less is a lot smaller. HDB and URA has maximum occupancy for a residence if occupants do not form a family unit. A 2 room flat has a maximum occupancy of 4 unrelated people and is from 36-45 sq m and has 1 toilet, shower, and 2 sinks, one in the kitchen. 3 room flat and above can fit 6 unrelated people, and for 3 room (60-65 sq m) there are 2 toilets, 2 showers, and 3 sinks. 

The minimum ratio is therefore 9 sq m per person in HDB. Even a family of 10 in a 3 room HDB would be 6 sq m per person, and 1 person better than ILO recommendations.  These are ratios that we can apply.",2020-05-02 13:23:18
"Coronavirus: after Little India riot, Singapore promised migrant workers decent housing. What happened?",,"I feel that your views are quite myopic.

Have you seen how migrant workers are housed and transported? They're treated like  woodpile. Can you imagine the safety and hygiene standards in these dormitories? What about the trucks on which scores of workers are transported without seat belts and harnesses? It's obvious that the lives of these workers *matter less* than your average Singaporean person.

The western media looks at the Middle-east and Singapore with entirely different lenses (for pretty obvious reasons); that is precisely why we've been able to avoid the public eye. The sign of any developed economy is one where *unskilled* labourers (your welders, fitters and electricians) earn a good healthy income. For instance, a lolly-pop man in Australia can earn upto a 120k AUD (factor in a 30-40% tax on that; that's still a take home of about 70-80k); this is why these roles are taken up by Australians (and not folks from South Asia or China). On the flip side, your educated class wouldn't be earning wages that are too dissimilar either. In other words, the income gap is quite narrow and regulated. This is a tell-tale sign of a good, healthy, developed economy; and it's a far cry from what we see here in Singapore.",2020-05-02 18:41:32

"Coronavirus: after Little India riot, Singapore promised migrant workers decent housing. What happened?",,"I edited my post. It's clear that army dorms are not like FW dorms. Let's not talk about camps first, as Tekong dorms, where we are confined for 2 weeks and cannot get a breather by booking out, have to be arranged ro reduce transmission of disease. They are more spacious and have excellent ventilation with windows and ceiling fans at max speed. 

The distancing between and across bunk beds is greater than in the Purpose Built Dormitories. In PBDs, the headboards are placed headboard to headboard. Their head is so close to their neighbours' feet. Even in camps there's greater space between bunks,  and a wardrobe. In PBDs, their barang is on the bed, floor, and s-hook. The cookhouse is also well ventilated. 

Some people may see the pictures and videos of PBDs and somehow believe it is similar to their NS experience. Got camera angle one ok! You think the MSM won't try to make dorms look as spacious as possible? Photos look very artistic also. At home see PBD and army bunks all can seem very nice. There's definitely a difference when you're there.

There is fundamentally a difference between housing in camps and dorms. The number of men in a bunk fluctuates and is getting smaller in general due to decreased manpower in the military from smaller cohorts. Dorm operators are incentivised to keep occupancy at maximum. Even for stay-in, when others book out there's more space. Dorms no book out. And other than the extreme minority with no home outside the camp, we still have a home to look forward to and enjoy. The dorms are their only home.",2020-05-02 19:00:48

"Coronavirus: after Little India riot, Singapore promised migrant workers decent housing. What happened?",,"In my original post, the point was giving them more space per room in a realistic scenario, which should be done by the way, *would not have prevented a dormitory cluster.*

Your point here is army dorm is more livable compared to fw dormitory. I cannot dispute this, you seem to know more details about the condition. I never said my post was infallible. So let's take this as it is. We reduce 1/5 men from every room that's really cramped and expand the dormitory. It's a realistic scenario. Fuck cost cutting. 
We can make it more livable.

Everyone gets more breathable living space.

Would that have changed anything about covid outbreak?

Maybe instead of averaging 1000 we'd get about 800~. Given that they would still share the same eating/cleaning space regardless I wonder how true that would be. I don't have expertise on the exact math of spread to build a model here.

There were no realistic scenario where we are able to give them enough privacy per person to prevent an outbreak. 

TL;DR this isn't exactly the right or wrong conversation for my post. People are mistaken about something, if they want better living conditions for FW, sure. I stand by the point it's not inhumane living condition, but it's also not ideal. 

If they are using covid as an argument for better living conditions, no, it would not have prevented dormitory clusters on the whole.

If you want to push the agenda for better living condition with the argument of minimizing the impact of covid outbreak though, I got nothing, full steam ahead. This was a compromise I left open in my original argument that no one took up because they were too busy trying to pin the entire FW dormitory outbreak on the corporations.

IMO the people who disagreed with my previous post were idealistic pussies who can't come up with a compromise themselves anyway. I have nothing against actual solutions. When you want to submit proposal of any kind in the working world you need concrete research. 

I personally have nothing against wanting better living conditions contrary to what my post might seem like on the first glance. I never stated it's impossible to improve living conditions, nor that there were no negligence. I simply have very tame expectations on what I believe is better living conditions.",2020-05-02 22:54:14

Nice strawman btw, imagine picking on the semantics about the middle east death camps. Is that an exaggeration? Yes. But so is the point the article made about the hygiene standard about the ALL the dorms in the SG. My point if you actually bothered the rest of my comment instead of just focusing on the semantics is that it's unfair of the article to lump ALL the dorms together as lacking the proper standards. It is one of the contributing factors for sure but there is definitely a sense of inevitability given how densely packed we are as a nation. 

Again you only choose to see in my comments what you wanna see. I give credit where credit is due in the article nowhere did I imply that it's an us against them type of mentality.

"Coronavirus: after Little India riot, Singapore promised migrant workers decent housing. What happened?",,"It's about the attitude the government has towards feedback and the vulnerable. That's what would have prevented this situation. 

The development of PBDs in 2015 were supposed to have reduced the risk and intensity of potential disease transmission. Today we acknowledge that they have become breeding dens for it. Three ministers of manpower from 2015 until now. 

Workers welfare has been an issue raised in the MSM in recent years. Spoiled meals delivered to construction sites and dorms, more expensive prices in dorm supermarkets, panel doctors giving too little MC so employers don't have to be marked for an accident. Inadequate action. 

March. Tourist spots close by themselves, since some tourist spots become clusters. Invisible hand of the market, nothing needs to be done. Construction sites don't close, when a few clusters appeared. 

Healthserve feedbacks that ruling for doctors to only practice at one location to prevent transmission means volunteer doctor numbers are gutted. No exemptions. (This means the govt did recognise that some workers shouldn't be travelling from place to place as they may spread disease. Another type of worker has already been spreading disease by now too. Hmm...) The forum letter on potential dorm vector. No visible action. 

April. Volunteer doctor mentions a sick worker who was able to keep his food down after getting Bengali food in MSM article on the incredible medical translation site that started with Bengali. We're still arguing about food now. Urgent begging for volunteers reveals that not enough staff in MOM, civil service and military know how to speak Bengali. MOM not working with HOME and TWC2. 

If the government had a more open attitude, they would be more transparent about what they have been doing in various sectors to prevent disease. Stakeholders like NGOs would have a back and forth. Assistants would point out pertinent concerns for ministers to address. FWs would know their rights clearly and feel safe reporting violations.

We would have had more healthcare staff in the public system since they weren't being mistreated. Transport services wouldn't have been cut. An information blast on how the enhanced CB was set to stop on 4 may and not June 1 would have been sent when bubble tea and haircut queues started to form. We wouldn't be wondering what a private citizen married to our PM is doing for an unknown salary.

Ok back to residential ratios. The point of a foreign worker levy is to make hiring foreign workers more costly, not exactly to earn tax revenue. If the standards were increased and levies cut, employers don't have to pay more. If it were easier for good, experienced workers to find work instead of having to leave when they lose their job, there wouldn't be a brain drain when the leave for elsewhere or go home and change jobs. We wouldn't be hiring indebted noobs to replace them several months later, reducing productivity. 

And so what if labour costs go up? How much of a contractors and developers costs are labour? How much would tenders have to go up? For BTOs, how much can HDB subsidise, perhaps in a targeted way? How much is the cost to our monthly mortgage? Let's stop with the fear mongering. The civil service should be calculating the forecasted costs like the independent Congressional Budget Office does in the US. 

I'm not well informed. I'm just asking questions, look for pieces of information to answer these questions, and try to make sense of what the situation. So I felt that the emotional dismissal of 'what about NS' needed some unpacking. Was the opinion that NSFs have it worse than FWs based on reality? Is this really a zero sum game? 

To fund this I'll have to talk about reserves, but I've spent too much time on this already. We are unique because we are tax haven that is good to live in. But what if we could become a more attractive place for VHNWIs and above without diluting our tax haven status too much? Do we need to be reinvesting our half of our returns? Do our reserves have to grow above GDP and inflation? How far ahead of every other country do we need to be in order to be satisfied? (Like SIA, it's fine not to be number 1 in some places but like Changi Airport, it's good to be number 1 in others.) Isn't Covid-19 a chance to have some exit from (sudden) sunset industries? How much could we afford to spend to make things right for Singapore?",2020-05-03 01:17:23

How Profitable are Dormitory Operators Anyway? A Basic Analysis of Centurion Corporation's Financials,"Hi All,

Been seeing a lot of discussion lately about the dormitory operators and their supposedly exorbitant profits, so decided to take a deeper look at the annual reports of one of the larger players commonly mentioned, Centurion Corporation Limited (CCL), to take a look if this is indeed true.

**Tldr:**

* Profit margins are not a useful tool to evaluate CCL's profitability
* CCL's ROA and ROE of 5.40% and 15.06% are comparable to similar industries in the US
* If dormitory operators are to bear the full cost of reducing density of worker housing, ROA falls significantly to 2.42%

# Why Profit Margins are not a good indicator

When discussing the profitability of dormitory operators, a commonly statistic cited here is CCL’s profit margin of 72%. Looking at the financials, CCL did register an average gross profit ratio (GPR) of 71.10% and net profit ratio (NPR) of 58.46% over the last three years, with GPR of 72.69% and NPR of 77.83% in 2019.

**Centurion Corporation's Revenue & Profits (2017 - 2019) (S$'000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|133,353.00|120,070.00|137,113.00|130,178.67|
|Gross Profit|96,936.00|86,321.00|94,210.00|92,489.00|
|**Gross Profit Ratio**|**72.69%**|**71.89%**|**68.71%**|**71.10%**|
|Net Profit|103,788.00|84,151.00|37,644.00|75,194.33|
|**Net Profit Ratio**|**77.83%**|**70.08%**|**27.45%**|**58.46%**|

However, this statistic fails to consider CCL’s substantial business interests outside of dormitories, primarily in overseas student accommodation, which accounted for 25.5% to 34.3% of their revenue over the last three years. Pulling out the numbers for just the dormitories and adjusting for one-off items, we see that CCL has earned an average of S$38.3 million per year over the last three years, substantially lower than the average S$75.2 million net profit shown above.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory Income (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Dormitory Revenue\* (A)|83,114.00|80,605.00|100,397.00|**88,038.67**|

*\* For the years 2017 – 2019, between 8.1% and 12.2% of Dormitory Revenue is attributable to Dormitories in Malaysia. However, as a further breakdown of the costs & assets by geography is unavailable, we will assume that the profitability of Malaysian dormitories is the same as those of Singaporean dormitories.*

*\*\* Earnings before Interest & Taxes*

*\*\*\* Core Income excludes one-off earnings/losses borne by the company, such as through sales/purchases of assets or fair value revaluation of assets. These were excluded due to their high volatility and lack of relevance to CCL’s core business. For reference, CCL registered $66.4 million, -$12.2 million and -$3.9 million in fair value gains/losses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

In addition, profit margins are not a useful indicator when evaluating the profitability of landlords like CCL, which are asset-heavy but incur minimal operating costs. As an analogy, if you rented out a room in your house for $1,000/month, and incurred additional utility fees of $100/month, would you consider it wildly profitable given profit margins of 90%? That is similar to evaluating CCL’s profitability based on their profit margin alone.

# Return on Assets

Instead of profit margins, a more suitable indicator to evaluate landlords would be the Return on Assets (ROA), which measures the profits earned by the company as a percentage of its total assets. Applying this ratio to CCL’s worker accommodation number, we get an average ROA of 5.40%, meaning for every $100 in assets the company owns, it gets approximately $5.40 back per year.

Given the high level of leverage employed by CCL, we can also go one step further and calculate their return on equity (ROE), which accounts for borrowings and averages out to 15.06%. To provide a rough analogy, this is the equivalent of buying a $1 million house, mortgaging it for $630,000 with the bank, and then earning $4,500/month in rental income.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory ROA and ROE (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Dormitory Pre-Tax Core   Income (D)|33,673.00|34,665.00|46,437.00|38,258.33|
|Dormitory Assets (E)|796,522.00|668,193.00|685,167.00|716,627.33|
|**Core Income Pre-Tax Return on Assets (D/E)**\*|**4.23%**|**5.19%**|**6.78%**|**5.40%**|
|Dormitory Borrowings (F)|453,165.00|469,210.00|426,502.00|449,625.67|
|**Core Income Pre-Tax Return   on Equity (D/(E-F))**|**9.81%**|**17.42%**|**17.95%**|**15.06%**|

*\* I have omitted corporate tax in this table due to uncertainties over the effective tax rate paid by CCL in Singapore on Worker Dormitories. Singapore’s standard corporate tax rate is 17%. CCL as a whole paid between 6.5%, 12.9%, and 23.8% of pre-tax income in corporate tax in 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

How do these numbers stack up? Comparing these to the ROA and ROE enjoyed by a comparable industry segment in the US, we see that CCL’s ROA and ROE of 5.4% and 15.06% fall roughly in line with the US accommodations sector, which enjoyed ROA and ROE of 6.4% and 16.3%.

**US Hotels, Rooming Houses, Camps, and Other Lodging Places ROA and ROE 2017 – 2019 (Source: Ready Ratios)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Return on Assets**|11.8%|4.1%|3.3%|**6.4%**|
|**Return on Equity**|34.0%|10.2%|5.7%|**16.3%**|

Closer to home, 99.co estimates that the average rental yield in Singapore is approximately 2.3% for residential properties (or $1,900 in our above example) and 3.3% for commercial properties (or $2,750 in our above example). While the returns from worker dormitories do seem significantly higher, they also enjoy considerably shorter leases, with most of CCL’s Singapore worker dormitories subject to leases of less than 30 years at the point of development.

# Other Possible Comments

>Profits don’t matter because the towkays are extracting their money through fat salaries instead

The three largest shareholders of CCL are Loh Kim Kang David, Hang Seng Juan, and Teo Peng Kwang, owning a total of 66.15%. While their combined salary of S$1,025,000 is significant, it ultimately represents only a small portion of CCL’s total costs.

There is of course a possibility that their children/wives/siblings/grandparents may be placed in other well-paid positions within CCL, allowing them to extract more money from it. However, this information was not available in the annual reports, and thus far I have found no evidence to support this suspicion.

&#x200B;

>This analysis is flawed because it fails to take into consideration X, Y, Z factors.

This is possible, the above analysis is only based on the information contained in their 2019, 2018 and 2017 Annual Reports. There may be other relevant pieces of information, particularly surrounding the terms and purchase/development cost of their land, which were not considered.

If you have additional information which may be relevant, do comment below and I’d be happy to integrate it into the above analysis. Any feedback on how the analysis could be improved would also be appreciated. Ultimately, I hope for this to be a platform to discuss how Singapore as a society can best move forward with the worker dormitory situation.

# So What’s Next?

I’m not going to comment as to whether 5.4% ROA or 15% ROE pre-tax is a reasonable profit for a dormitory operator to make. However, I want to highlight the following – If we adjust the figures for 20% less occupancy, or the equivalent of converting all 10-man bunks into 8-man bunks, while maintaining the current level of amenities (e.g. frequency of maintenance, security systems), the ROA for last year falls from 4.23% to 2.42%.

**Figures Adjusted for 20% Less Occupancy (2019)**

|**Category**|**2019 Original**|**2019 Adjusted**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Dormitory Revenue|83,114.00|66,491.20|
|Operating, Distribution & Administrative Expenses Attributable to Dormitories\*|30,884.00|28,629.47|

|Dormitory Assets|796,522.00|796,522.00|
|**Core Income Pre-Tax Return on Assets**|**4.23%**|**2.42%**|

*\* For the purposes of this calculation, $11,272.66 or 36.5% of Operating Expenses were considered variable costs, and scaled down accordingly. These comprised of Property Tax, Utilities, Transportation Expenses, Impairment Allowance, Raw Materials & Consumables, Changes in Inventories and Other Costs. S$19,611 or 63.5% of Operating Expenses were considered as fixed costs, comprising of Depreciation, Employee Compensation, Rental Expenses, Repairs & Maintenance, Insurance, Security Systems, and Professional Service Fees.*

&#x200B;

While with sufficient political will it may be possible to strong-arm current dormitory operators to improve the living conditions of foreign workers living in dormitories without increasing their prices, the challenge comes in providing additional living spaces for the 20% of foreign workers who are now displaced from their old dorms. Would 2.42% pre-tax ROA be sufficient to entice new investors to build foreign worker dormitories?

*\*\* Earnings before Interest & Taxes*

*\*\*\* Core Income excludes one-off earnings/losses borne by the company, such as through sales/purchases of assets or fair value revaluation of assets. These were excluded due to their high volatility and lack of relevance to CCL’s core business. For reference, CCL registered $66.4 million, -$12.2 million and -$3.9 million in fair value gains/losses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

In addition, profit margins are not a useful indicator when evaluating the profitability of landlords like CCL, which are asset-heavy but incur minimal operating costs. As an analogy, if you rented out a room in your house for $1,000/month, and incurred additional utility fees of $100/month, would you consider it wildly profitable given profit margins of 90%? That is similar to evaluating CCL’s profitability based on their profit margin alone.

# Return on Assets

Instead of profit margins, a more suitable indicator to evaluate landlords would be the Return on Assets (ROA), which measures the profits earned by the company as a percentage of its total assets. Applying this ratio to CCL’s worker accommodation number, we get an average ROA of 5.40%, meaning for every $100 in assets the company owns, it gets approximately $5.40 back per year.

Given the high level of leverage employed by CCL, we can also go one step further and calculate their return on equity (ROE), which accounts for borrowings and averages out to 15.06%. To provide a rough analogy, this is the equivalent of buying a $1 million house, mortgaging it for $630,000 with the bank, and then earning $4,500/month in rental income.

*\* I have omitted corporate tax in this table due to uncertainties over the effective tax rate paid by CCL in Singapore on Worker Dormitories. Singapore’s standard corporate tax rate is 17%. CCL as a whole paid between 6.5%, 12.9%, and 23.8% of pre-tax income in corporate tax in 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

How do these numbers stack up? Comparing these to the ROA and ROE enjoyed by a comparable industry segment in the US, we see that CCL’s ROA and ROE of 5.4% and 15.06% fall roughly in line with the US accommodations sector, which enjoyed ROA and ROE of 6.4% and 16.3%.

**US Hotels, Rooming Houses, Camps, and Other Lodging Places ROA and ROE 2017 – 2019 (Source: Ready Ratios)**

|**Return on Equity**|34.0%|10.2%|5.7%|**16.3%**|

Closer to home, 99.co estimates that the average rental yield in Singapore is approximately 2.3% for residential properties (or $1,900 in our above example) and 3.3% for commercial properties (or $2,750 in our above example). While the returns from worker dormitories do seem significantly higher, they also enjoy considerably shorter leases, with most of CCL’s Singapore worker dormitories subject to leases of less than 30 years at the point of development.

# So What’s Next?

I’m not going to comment as to whether 5.4% ROA or 15% ROE pre-tax is a reasonable profit for a dormitory operator to make. However, I want to highlight the following – If we adjust the figures for 20% less occupancy, or the equivalent of converting all 10-man bunks into 8-man bunks, while maintaining the current level of amenities (e.g. frequency of maintenance, security systems), the ROA for last year falls from 4.23% to 2.42%.

While with sufficient political will it may be possible to strong-arm current dormitory operators to improve the living conditions of foreign workers living in dormitories without increasing their prices, the challenge comes in providing additional living spaces for the 20% of foreign workers who are now displaced from their old dorms. Would 2.42% pre-tax ROA be sufficient to entice new investors to build foreign worker dormitories?

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for the gold kind Redditor!","Do you work in a finance related field? Otherwise allow me to share some comments because I do and have been for a long time.

Despite what you may think, operating margin is still the most effective way of determining a company's financial health and credit profile. It is the number one thing which investors and creditors look to for most companies, since companies distribute their earnings to investors in the form of dividends and creditors get paid their due interests, all based on operating profits. You would need to have very special reasoning to substantiate the use of ROA from a financial analyst and also the company's directors perspectives. For example, an investment company which has the majority of its assets in share equity, cash and other financial assets, with very little operating expenses. Otherwise, operating profits is in almost all the cases the main determinant for the CEO's bonuses and salaries. From my understanding, I don't see any special reasoning to not use the OM to assess the company you mentioned and to also remunerate its executives for their work.

Next, there is depreciation of the properties owned by this company which would have been captured in the income statement and operating profit. For a company to be making so much profits in excess of its operating expenses and depreciation would sound off to me that the company must have derived some type of intangible benefit (such as being a first mover in an industry, or being in an industry with very low competition or strict regulations) since it has so highly valued its properties such that they are earning so much profits from it. This all the more supports the use of OM as it comprehensively captures the depreciation from the properties, as well as the operating expenses incurred from the financing, regular servicing and maintenance of such properties.

Lastly, you should probably be comparing its ratios (whether OM or ROA) over a longer period of time. I assumed you used the right formula for ROA which should be the average productive assets instead of whatever the simple figure is in the balance sheet as of the year. Comparing over time gives a better picture of whether the company is consistently making profits (in which case, I would wonder why are there not more companies going into this industry, if it is so profitable) or are there actually bad years for this company that is not observed by the public? Using ROA over time will also probably show you an increasing trend as assets get depreciated over time, so ROA would increase (notwithstanding that I think ROA is a bad indicator of performance).

Happy to hear your comments or counterpoints if any. Apologies in advance if this is overly harsh as any corporate financial analyst would tell you that ROA is typically seen as a fancy ratio cooked up by accountants which really doesn't serve any purpose or value when it comes to decision making at the very top of the company, and for the company's long term sustainability.",2020-06-17 05:03:47
How Profitable are Dormitory Operators Anyway? A Basic Analysis of Centurion Corporation's Financials,"Hi All,

Been seeing a lot of discussion lately about the dormitory operators and their supposedly exorbitant profits, so decided to take a deeper look at the annual reports of one of the larger players commonly mentioned, Centurion Corporation Limited (CCL), to take a look if this is indeed true.

**Tldr:**

* Profit margins are not a useful tool to evaluate CCL's profitability
* CCL's ROA and ROE of 5.40% and 15.06% are comparable to similar industries in the US
* If dormitory operators are to bear the full cost of reducing density of worker housing, ROA falls significantly to 2.42%

# Why Profit Margins are not a good indicator

When discussing the profitability of dormitory operators, a commonly statistic cited here is CCL’s profit margin of 72%. Looking at the financials, CCL did register an average gross profit ratio (GPR) of 71.10% and net profit ratio (NPR) of 58.46% over the last three years, with GPR of 72.69% and NPR of 77.83% in 2019.

**Centurion Corporation's Revenue & Profits (2017 - 2019) (S$'000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|

|**Net Profit Ratio**|**77.83%**|**70.08%**|**27.45%**|**58.46%**|

However, this statistic fails to consider CCL’s substantial business interests outside of dormitories, primarily in overseas student accommodation, which accounted for 25.5% to 34.3% of their revenue over the last three years. Pulling out the numbers for just the dormitories and adjusting for one-off items, we see that CCL has earned an average of S$38.3 million per year over the last three years, substantially lower than the average S$75.2 million net profit shown above.

&#x200B;

In addition, profit margins are not a useful indicator when evaluating the profitability of landlords like CCL, which are asset-heavy but incur minimal operating costs. As an analogy, if you rented out a room in your house for $1,000/month, and incurred additional utility fees of $100/month, would you consider it wildly profitable given profit margins of 90%? That is similar to evaluating CCL’s profitability based on their profit margin alone.

# Return on Assets

Instead of profit margins, a more suitable indicator to evaluate landlords would be the Return on Assets (ROA), which measures the profits earned by the company as a percentage of its total assets. Applying this ratio to CCL’s worker accommodation number, we get an average ROA of 5.40%, meaning for every $100 in assets the company owns, it gets approximately $5.40 back per year.

Given the high level of leverage employed by CCL, we can also go one step further and calculate their return on equity (ROE), which accounts for borrowings and averages out to 15.06%. To provide a rough analogy, this is the equivalent of buying a $1 million house, mortgaging it for $630,000 with the bank, and then earning $4,500/month in rental income.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory ROA and ROE (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

|**Core Income Pre-Tax Return   on Equity (D/(E-F))**|**9.81%**|**17.42%**|**17.95%**|**15.06%**|

*\* I have omitted corporate tax in this table due to uncertainties over the effective tax rate paid by CCL in Singapore on Worker Dormitories. Singapore’s standard corporate tax rate is 17%. CCL as a whole paid between 6.5%, 12.9%, and 23.8% of pre-tax income in corporate tax in 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

How do these numbers stack up? Comparing these to the ROA and ROE enjoyed by a comparable industry segment in the US, we see that CCL’s ROA and ROE of 5.4% and 15.06% fall roughly in line with the US accommodations sector, which enjoyed ROA and ROE of 6.4% and 16.3%.

**US Hotels, Rooming Houses, Camps, and Other Lodging Places ROA and ROE 2017 – 2019 (Source: Ready Ratios)**

|**Return on Assets**|11.8%|4.1%|3.3%|**6.4%**|
|**Return on Equity**|34.0%|10.2%|5.7%|**16.3%**|

Closer to home, 99.co estimates that the average rental yield in Singapore is approximately 2.3% for residential properties (or $1,900 in our above example) and 3.3% for commercial properties (or $2,750 in our above example). While the returns from worker dormitories do seem significantly higher, they also enjoy considerably shorter leases, with most of CCL’s Singapore worker dormitories subject to leases of less than 30 years at the point of development.

# Other Possible Comments

The three largest shareholders of CCL are Loh Kim Kang David, Hang Seng Juan, and Teo Peng Kwang, owning a total of 66.15%. While their combined salary of S$1,025,000 is significant, it ultimately represents only a small portion of CCL’s total costs.

There is of course a possibility that their children/wives/siblings/grandparents may be placed in other well-paid positions within CCL, allowing them to extract more money from it. However, this information was not available in the annual reports, and thus far I have found no evidence to support this suspicion.

&#x200B;

>This analysis is flawed because it fails to take into consideration X, Y, Z factors.

This is possible, the above analysis is only based on the information contained in their 2019, 2018 and 2017 Annual Reports. There may be other relevant pieces of information, particularly surrounding the terms and purchase/development cost of their land, which were not considered.

If you have additional information which may be relevant, do comment below and I’d be happy to integrate it into the above analysis. Any feedback on how the analysis could be improved would also be appreciated. Ultimately, I hope for this to be a platform to discuss how Singapore as a society can best move forward with the worker dormitory situation.

# So What’s Next?

I’m not going to comment as to whether 5.4% ROA or 15% ROE pre-tax is a reasonable profit for a dormitory operator to make. However, I want to highlight the following – If we adjust the figures for 20% less occupancy, or the equivalent of converting all 10-man bunks into 8-man bunks, while maintaining the current level of amenities (e.g. frequency of maintenance, security systems), the ROA for last year falls from 4.23% to 2.42%.

S$19,611 or 63.5% of Operating Expenses were considered as fixed costs, comprising of Depreciation, Employee Compensation, Rental Expenses, Repairs & Maintenance, Insurance, Security Systems, and Professional Service Fees.*

&#x200B;

While with sufficient political will it may be possible to strong-arm current dormitory operators to improve the living conditions of foreign workers living in dormitories without increasing their prices, the challenge comes in providing additional living spaces for the 20% of foreign workers who are now displaced from their old dorms. Would 2.42% pre-tax ROA be sufficient to entice new investors to build foreign worker dormitories?

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for the gold kind Redditor!","Actually it’s not about the operators not wanting to give the residents decent life ....it’s really about social pressures


I think general public will eventually find it absurd to provide so much facilities or personal space for a ‘construction worker’ (honestly many consider it as pariah job)

We already have seen the faces of few masters on how they treat their maids. We will here lots of grumpy voices of how one has to stay in a tiny expensive HdB Yet a foreign worker get low cost ‘home’ and need not pay CPF. There is gonna be lots of these conversations coming",2020-06-16 23:12:09
How Profitable are Dormitory Operators Anyway? A Basic Analysis of Centurion Corporation's Financials,"Hi All,

Been seeing a lot of discussion lately about the dormitory operators and their supposedly exorbitant profits, so decided to take a deeper look at the annual reports of one of the larger players commonly mentioned, Centurion Corporation Limited (CCL), to take a look if this is indeed true.

**Tldr:**

* Profit margins are not a useful tool to evaluate CCL's profitability
* CCL's ROA and ROE of 5.40% and 15.06% are comparable to similar industries in the US
* If dormitory operators are to bear the full cost of reducing density of worker housing, ROA falls significantly to 2.42%

# Why Profit Margins are not a good indicator

When discussing the profitability of dormitory operators, a commonly statistic cited here is CCL’s profit margin of 72%. Looking at the financials, CCL did register an average gross profit ratio (GPR) of 71.10% and net profit ratio (NPR) of 58.46% over the last three years, with GPR of 72.69% and NPR of 77.83% in 2019.

**Centurion Corporation's Revenue & Profits (2017 - 2019) (S$'000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|**Net Profit Ratio**|**77.83%**|**70.08%**|**27.45%**|**58.46%**|

However, this statistic fails to consider CCL’s substantial business interests outside of dormitories, primarily in overseas student accommodation, which accounted for 25.5% to 34.3% of their revenue over the last three years. Pulling out the numbers for just the dormitories and adjusting for one-off items, we see that CCL has earned an average of S$38.3 million per year over the last three years, substantially lower than the average S$75.2 million net profit shown above.

Instead of profit margins, a more suitable indicator to evaluate landlords would be the Return on Assets (ROA), which measures the profits earned by the company as a percentage of its total assets. Applying this ratio to CCL’s worker accommodation number, we get an average ROA of 5.40%, meaning for every $100 in assets the company owns, it gets approximately $5.40 back per year.

Given the high level of leverage employed by CCL, we can also go one step further and calculate their return on equity (ROE), which accounts for borrowings and averages out to 15.06%. To provide a rough analogy, this is the equivalent of buying a $1 million house, mortgaging it for $630,000 with the bank, and then earning $4,500/month in rental income.

*\* I have omitted corporate tax in this table due to uncertainties over the effective tax rate paid by CCL in Singapore on Worker Dormitories. Singapore’s standard corporate tax rate is 17%. CCL as a whole paid between 6.5%, 12.9%, and 23.8% of pre-tax income in corporate tax in 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

How do these numbers stack up? Comparing these to the ROA and ROE enjoyed by a comparable industry segment in the US, we see that CCL’s ROA and ROE of 5.4% and 15.06% fall roughly in line with the US accommodations sector, which enjoyed ROA and ROE of 6.4% and 16.3%.

|**Return on Equity**|34.0%|10.2%|5.7%|**16.3%**|

Closer to home, 99.co estimates that the average rental yield in Singapore is approximately 2.3% for residential properties (or $1,900 in our above example) and 3.3% for commercial properties (or $2,750 in our above example). While the returns from worker dormitories do seem significantly higher, they also enjoy considerably shorter leases, with most of CCL’s Singapore worker dormitories subject to leases of less than 30 years at the point of development.

# Other Possible Comments

The three largest shareholders of CCL are Loh Kim Kang David, Hang Seng Juan, and Teo Peng Kwang, owning a total of 66.15%. While their combined salary of S$1,025,000 is significant, it ultimately represents only a small portion of CCL’s total costs.

There is of course a possibility that their children/wives/siblings/grandparents may be placed in other well-paid positions within CCL, allowing them to extract more money from it. However, this information was not available in the annual reports, and thus far I have found no evidence to support this suspicion.

Any feedback on how the analysis could be improved would also be appreciated. Ultimately, I hope for this to be a platform to discuss how Singapore as a society can best move forward with the worker dormitory situation.

# So What’s Next?

I’m not going to comment as to whether 5.4% ROA or 15% ROE pre-tax is a reasonable profit for a dormitory operator to make. However, I want to highlight the following – If we adjust the figures for 20% less occupancy, or the equivalent of converting all 10-man bunks into 8-man bunks, while maintaining the current level of amenities (e.g. frequency of maintenance, security systems), the ROA for last year falls from 4.23% to 2.42%.

S$19,611 or 63.5% of Operating Expenses were considered as fixed costs, comprising of Depreciation, Employee Compensation, Rental Expenses, Repairs & Maintenance, Insurance, Security Systems, and Professional Service Fees.*

&#x200B;

While with sufficient political will it may be possible to strong-arm current dormitory operators to improve the living conditions of foreign workers living in dormitories without increasing their prices, the challenge comes in providing additional living spaces for the 20% of foreign workers who are now displaced from their old dorms. Would 2.42% pre-tax ROA be sufficient to entice new investors to build foreign worker dormitories?

How Profitable are Dormitory Operators Anyway? A Basic Analysis of Centurion Corporation's Financials,"Hi All,

Been seeing a lot of discussion lately about the dormitory operators and their supposedly exorbitant profits, so decided to take a deeper look at the annual reports of one of the larger players commonly mentioned, Centurion Corporation Limited (CCL), to take a look if this is indeed true.

**Tldr:**

* Profit margins are not a useful tool to evaluate CCL's profitability
* CCL's ROA and ROE of 5.40% and 15.06% are comparable to similar industries in the US
* If dormitory operators are to bear the full cost of reducing density of worker housing, ROA falls significantly to 2.42%

# Why Profit Margins are not a good indicator

When discussing the profitability of dormitory operators, a commonly statistic cited here is CCL’s profit margin of 72%. Looking at the financials, CCL did register an average gross profit ratio (GPR) of 71.10% and net profit ratio (NPR) of 58.46% over the last three years, with GPR of 72.69% and NPR of 77.83% in 2019.

**Centurion Corporation's Revenue & Profits (2017 - 2019) (S$'000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|133,353.00|120,070.00|137,113.00|130,178.67|
|Gross Profit|96,936.00|86,321.00|94,210.00|92,489.00|
|**Gross Profit Ratio**|**72.69%**|**71.89%**|**68.71%**|**71.10%**|
|Net Profit|103,788.00|84,151.00|37,644.00|75,194.33|
|**Net Profit Ratio**|**77.83%**|**70.08%**|**27.45%**|**58.46%**|

However, this statistic fails to consider CCL’s substantial business interests outside of dormitories, primarily in overseas student accommodation, which accounted for 25.5% to 34.3% of their revenue over the last three years. Pulling out the numbers for just the dormitories and adjusting for one-off items, we see that CCL has earned an average of S$38.3 million per year over the last three years, substantially lower than the average S$75.2 million net profit shown above.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory Income (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

*\* For the years 2017 – 2019, between 8.1% and 12.2% of Dormitory Revenue is attributable to Dormitories in Malaysia. However, as a further breakdown of the costs & assets by geography is unavailable, we will assume that the profitability of Malaysian dormitories is the same as those of Singaporean dormitories.*

*\*\* Earnings before Interest & Taxes*

*\*\*\* Core Income excludes one-off earnings/losses borne by the company, such as through sales/purchases of assets or fair value revaluation of assets. These were excluded due to their high volatility and lack of relevance to CCL’s core business. For reference, CCL registered $66.4 million, -$12.2 million and -$3.9 million in fair value gains/losses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

In addition, profit margins are not a useful indicator when evaluating the profitability of landlords like CCL, which are asset-heavy but incur minimal operating costs. As an analogy, if you rented out a room in your house for $1,000/month, and incurred additional utility fees of $100/month, would you consider it wildly profitable given profit margins of 90%? That is similar to evaluating CCL’s profitability based on their profit margin alone.

Plenty of them are already staying at hotels. A significant proportion are paid for by the government, but I suspect dorm operators will be made to pay for them soon.

As a hotelier, I expect international tourism to be effectively dead for the next 12-24 months. There are plenty of empty rooms in the high-tier market segment which are waiting to be used now.",2020-06-17 08:50:07

How do these numbers stack up? Comparing these to the ROA and ROE enjoyed by a comparable industry segment in the US, we see that CCL’s ROA and ROE of 5.4% and 15.06% fall roughly in line with the US accommodations sector, which enjoyed ROA and ROE of 6.4% and 16.3%.

While the returns from worker dormitories do seem significantly higher, they also enjoy considerably shorter leases, with most of CCL’s Singapore worker dormitories subject to leases of less than 30 years at the point of development.

The three largest shareholders of CCL are Loh Kim Kang David, Hang Seng Juan, and Teo Peng Kwang, owning a total of 66.15%. While their combined salary of S$1,025,000 is significant, it ultimately represents only a small portion of CCL’s total costs.

There is of course a possibility that their children/wives/siblings/grandparents may be placed in other well-paid positions within CCL, allowing them to extract more money from it. However, this information was not available in the annual reports, and thus far I have found no evidence to support this suspicion.

This is possible, the above analysis is only based on the information contained in their 2019, 2018 and 2017 Annual Reports. There may be other relevant pieces of information, particularly surrounding the terms and purchase/development cost of their land, which were not considered.

Any feedback on how the analysis could be improved would also be appreciated. Ultimately, I hope for this to be a platform to discuss how Singapore as a society can best move forward with the worker dormitory situation.

# So What’s Next?

I’m not going to comment as to whether 5.4% ROA or 15% ROE pre-tax is a reasonable profit for a dormitory operator to make. However, I want to highlight the following – If we adjust the figures for 20% less occupancy, or the equivalent of converting all 10-man bunks into 8-man bunks, while maintaining the current level of amenities (e.g. frequency of maintenance, security systems), the ROA for last year falls from 4.23% to 2.42%.

S$19,611 or 63.5% of Operating Expenses were considered as fixed costs, comprising of Depreciation, Employee Compensation, Rental Expenses, Repairs & Maintenance, Insurance, Security Systems, and Professional Service Fees.*

&#x200B;

While with sufficient political will it may be possible to strong-arm current dormitory operators to improve the living conditions of foreign workers living in dormitories without increasing their prices, the challenge comes in providing additional living spaces for the 20% of foreign workers who are now displaced from their old dorms. Would 2.42% pre-tax ROA be sufficient to entice new investors to build foreign worker dormitories?

How Profitable are Dormitory Operators Anyway? A Basic Analysis of Centurion Corporation's Financials,"Hi All,

Been seeing a lot of discussion lately about the dormitory operators and their supposedly exorbitant profits, so decided to take a deeper look at the annual reports of one of the larger players commonly mentioned, Centurion Corporation Limited (CCL), to take a look if this is indeed true.

**Tldr:**

* Profit margins are not a useful tool to evaluate CCL's profitability
* CCL's ROA and ROE of 5.40% and 15.06% are comparable to similar industries in the US
* If dormitory operators are to bear the full cost of reducing density of worker housing, ROA falls significantly to 2.42%

# Why Profit Margins are not a good indicator

When discussing the profitability of dormitory operators, a commonly statistic cited here is CCL’s profit margin of 72%. Looking at the financials, CCL did register an average gross profit ratio (GPR) of 71.10% and net profit ratio (NPR) of 58.46% over the last three years, with GPR of 72.69% and NPR of 77.83% in 2019.

**Centurion Corporation's Revenue & Profits (2017 - 2019) (S$'000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|133,353.00|120,070.00|137,113.00|130,178.67|
|Gross Profit|96,936.00|86,321.00|94,210.00|92,489.00|
|**Gross Profit Ratio**|**72.69%**|**71.89%**|**68.71%**|**71.10%**|
|Net Profit|103,788.00|84,151.00|37,644.00|75,194.33|
|**Net Profit Ratio**|**77.83%**|**70.08%**|**27.45%**|**58.46%**|

However, this statistic fails to consider CCL’s substantial business interests outside of dormitories, primarily in overseas student accommodation, which accounted for 25.5% to 34.3% of their revenue over the last three years. Pulling out the numbers for just the dormitories and adjusting for one-off items, we see that CCL has earned an average of S$38.3 million per year over the last three years, substantially lower than the average S$75.2 million net profit shown above.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory Income (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

*\* For the years 2017 – 2019, between 8.1% and 12.2% of Dormitory Revenue is attributable to Dormitories in Malaysia. However, as a further breakdown of the costs & assets by geography is unavailable, we will assume that the profitability of Malaysian dormitories is the same as those of Singaporean dormitories.*

*\*\* Earnings before Interest & Taxes*

*\*\*\* Core Income excludes one-off earnings/losses borne by the company, such as through sales/purchases of assets or fair value revaluation of assets. These were excluded due to their high volatility and lack of relevance to CCL’s core business. For reference, CCL registered $66.4 million, -$12.2 million and -$3.9 million in fair value gains/losses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

In addition, profit margins are not a useful indicator when evaluating the profitability of landlords like CCL, which are asset-heavy but incur minimal operating costs. As an analogy, if you rented out a room in your house for $1,000/month, and incurred additional utility fees of $100/month, would you consider it wildly profitable given profit margins of 90%? That is similar to evaluating CCL’s profitability based on their profit margin alone.

# Return on Assets

Instead of profit margins, a more suitable indicator to evaluate landlords would be the Return on Assets (ROA), which measures the profits earned by the company as a percentage of its total assets. Applying this ratio to CCL’s worker accommodation number, we get an average ROA of 5.40%, meaning for every $100 in assets the company owns, it gets approximately $5.40 back per year.

Given the high level of leverage employed by CCL, we can also go one step further and calculate their return on equity (ROE), which accounts for borrowings and averages out to 15.06%. To provide a rough analogy, this is the equivalent of buying a $1 million house, mortgaging it for $630,000 with the bank, and then earning $4,500/month in rental income.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory ROA and ROE (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

|**Core Income Pre-Tax Return   on Equity (D/(E-F))**|**9.81%**|**17.42%**|**17.95%**|**15.06%**|

*\* I have omitted corporate tax in this table due to uncertainties over the effective tax rate paid by CCL in Singapore on Worker Dormitories. Singapore’s standard corporate tax rate is 17%. CCL as a whole paid between 6.5%, 12.9%, and 23.8% of pre-tax income in corporate tax in 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

Also, ROA challenge is bloated asset price or book value. How about ROCE? On the bosses salary, income that's ok with me as one need to get fairly compensated. I am sure without significant $$$, they are not going to have weekend bungalows in sentosa or multi million $ houses. 

But the whole point is not about the dorm operators but the regulatory or agency or ministers. They are responsible and accountable to the public and they can't simply be excused by saying we let the business run based on profit margins and not on some basic human needs.",2020-06-16 21:11:34

I’m not going to comment as to whether 5.4% ROA or 15% ROE pre-tax is a reasonable profit for a dormitory operator to make. However, I want to highlight the following – If we adjust the figures for 20% less occupancy, or the equivalent of converting all 10-man bunks into 8-man bunks, while maintaining the current level of amenities (e.g. frequency of maintenance, security systems), the ROA for last year falls from 4.23% to 2.42%.

&#x200B;

While with sufficient political will it may be possible to strong-arm current dormitory operators to improve the living conditions of foreign workers living in dormitories without increasing their prices, the challenge comes in providing additional living spaces for the 20% of foreign workers who are now displaced from their old dorms. Would 2.42% pre-tax ROA be sufficient to entice new investors to build foreign worker dormitories?

How Profitable are Dormitory Operators Anyway? A Basic Analysis of Centurion Corporation's Financials,"Hi All,

Been seeing a lot of discussion lately about the dormitory operators and their supposedly exorbitant profits, so decided to take a deeper look at the annual reports of one of the larger players commonly mentioned, Centurion Corporation Limited (CCL), to take a look if this is indeed true.

**Tldr:**

* Profit margins are not a useful tool to evaluate CCL's profitability
* CCL's ROA and ROE of 5.40% and 15.06% are comparable to similar industries in the US
* If dormitory operators are to bear the full cost of reducing density of worker housing, ROA falls significantly to 2.42%

# Why Profit Margins are not a good indicator

When discussing the profitability of dormitory operators, a commonly statistic cited here is CCL’s profit margin of 72%. Looking at the financials, CCL did register an average gross profit ratio (GPR) of 71.10% and net profit ratio (NPR) of 58.46% over the last three years, with GPR of 72.69% and NPR of 77.83% in 2019.

**Centurion Corporation's Revenue & Profits (2017 - 2019) (S$'000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|133,353.00|120,070.00|137,113.00|130,178.67|
|Gross Profit|96,936.00|86,321.00|94,210.00|92,489.00|
|**Gross Profit Ratio**|**72.69%**|**71.89%**|**68.71%**|**71.10%**|
|Net Profit|103,788.00|84,151.00|37,644.00|75,194.33|
|**Net Profit Ratio**|**77.83%**|**70.08%**|**27.45%**|**58.46%**|

However, this statistic fails to consider CCL’s substantial business interests outside of dormitories, primarily in overseas student accommodation, which accounted for 25.5% to 34.3% of their revenue over the last three years. Pulling out the numbers for just the dormitories and adjusting for one-off items, we see that CCL has earned an average of S$38.3 million per year over the last three years, substantially lower than the average S$75.2 million net profit shown above.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory Income (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Dormitory Revenue\* (A)|83,114.00|80,605.00|100,397.00|**88,038.67**|

*\* For the years 2017 – 2019, between 8.1% and 12.2% of Dormitory Revenue is attributable to Dormitories in Malaysia. However, as a further breakdown of the costs & assets by geography is unavailable, we will assume that the profitability of Malaysian dormitories is the same as those of Singaporean dormitories.*

*\*\* Earnings before Interest & Taxes*

*\*\*\* Core Income excludes one-off earnings/losses borne by the company, such as through sales/purchases of assets or fair value revaluation of assets. These were excluded due to their high volatility and lack of relevance to CCL’s core business. For reference, CCL registered $66.4 million, -$12.2 million and -$3.9 million in fair value gains/losses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

In addition, profit margins are not a useful indicator when evaluating the profitability of landlords like CCL, which are asset-heavy but incur minimal operating costs. As an analogy, if you rented out a room in your house for $1,000/month, and incurred additional utility fees of $100/month, would you consider it wildly profitable given profit margins of 90%? That is similar to evaluating CCL’s profitability based on their profit margin alone.

# Return on Assets

Instead of profit margins, a more suitable indicator to evaluate landlords would be the Return on Assets (ROA), which measures the profits earned by the company as a percentage of its total assets. Applying this ratio to CCL’s worker accommodation number, we get an average ROA of 5.40%, meaning for every $100 in assets the company owns, it gets approximately $5.40 back per year.

Given the high level of leverage employed by CCL, we can also go one step further and calculate their return on equity (ROE), which accounts for borrowings and averages out to 15.06%. To provide a rough analogy, this is the equivalent of buying a $1 million house, mortgaging it for $630,000 with the bank, and then earning $4,500/month in rental income.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory ROA and ROE (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Dormitory Pre-Tax Core   Income (D)|33,673.00|34,665.00|46,437.00|38,258.33|
|Dormitory Assets (E)|796,522.00|668,193.00|685,167.00|716,627.33|
|**Core Income Pre-Tax Return on Assets (D/E)**\*|**4.23%**|**5.19%**|**6.78%**|**5.40%**|
|Dormitory Borrowings (F)|453,165.00|469,210.00|426,502.00|449,625.67|
|**Core Income Pre-Tax Return   on Equity (D/(E-F))**|**9.81%**|**17.42%**|**17.95%**|**15.06%**|

*\* I have omitted corporate tax in this table due to uncertainties over the effective tax rate paid by CCL in Singapore on Worker Dormitories. Singapore’s standard corporate tax rate is 17%. CCL as a whole paid between 6.5%, 12.9%, and 23.8% of pre-tax income in corporate tax in 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

How do these numbers stack up? Comparing these to the ROA and ROE enjoyed by a comparable industry segment in the US, we see that CCL’s ROA and ROE of 5.4% and 15.06% fall roughly in line with the US accommodations sector, which enjoyed ROA and ROE of 6.4% and 16.3%.

**US Hotels, Rooming Houses, Camps, and Other Lodging Places ROA and ROE 2017 – 2019 (Source: Ready Ratios)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Return on Assets**|11.8%|4.1%|3.3%|**6.4%**|
|**Return on Equity**|34.0%|10.2%|5.7%|**16.3%**|

Closer to home, 99.co estimates that the average rental yield in Singapore is approximately 2.3% for residential properties (or $1,900 in our above example) and 3.3% for commercial properties (or $2,750 in our above example). While the returns from worker dormitories do seem significantly higher, they also enjoy considerably shorter leases, with most of CCL’s Singapore worker dormitories subject to leases of less than 30 years at the point of development.

# Other Possible Comments

>Profits don’t matter because the towkays are extracting their money through fat salaries instead

The three largest shareholders of CCL are Loh Kim Kang David, Hang Seng Juan, and Teo Peng Kwang, owning a total of 66.15%. While their combined salary of S$1,025,000 is significant, it ultimately represents only a small portion of CCL’s total costs.

While with sufficient political will it may be possible to strong-arm current dormitory operators to improve the living conditions of foreign workers living in dormitories without increasing their prices, the challenge comes in providing additional living spaces for the 20% of foreign workers who are now displaced from their old dorms. Would 2.42% pre-tax ROA be sufficient to entice new investors to build foreign worker dormitories?

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for the gold kind Redditor!","there were 2 problems with dorms. govt dropping the ball on regulation for years and dorm operators having crappy dorms 

no need to think so much about earning b4 taxes or overseas profits etc.

keep it simple.  

open up the industry to allow smaller player to participate. increase the fines cos the previous ones were too little if half of them can flout it yearly without care. have higher standard for living conditions. as long as there is money on the table these companies will still be operating dorms. statements they make about increasing costs which will be passed to consumers or taxpayer is just pr statement hoping to scare ppl. if we get more competition into the market by allowing smaller dorms to operate we can call them out on their bluff.

How Profitable are Dormitory Operators Anyway? A Basic Analysis of Centurion Corporation's Financials,"Hi All,

Been seeing a lot of discussion lately about the dormitory operators and their supposedly exorbitant profits, so decided to take a deeper look at the annual reports of one of the larger players commonly mentioned, Centurion Corporation Limited (CCL), to take a look if this is indeed true.

**Tldr:**

* Profit margins are not a useful tool to evaluate CCL's profitability
* CCL's ROA and ROE of 5.40% and 15.06% are comparable to similar industries in the US
* If dormitory operators are to bear the full cost of reducing density of worker housing, ROA falls significantly to 2.42%

# Why Profit Margins are not a good indicator

When discussing the profitability of dormitory operators, a commonly statistic cited here is CCL’s profit margin of 72%. Looking at the financials, CCL did register an average gross profit ratio (GPR) of 71.10% and net profit ratio (NPR) of 58.46% over the last three years, with GPR of 72.69% and NPR of 77.83% in 2019.

**Centurion Corporation's Revenue & Profits (2017 - 2019) (S$'000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|133,353.00|120,070.00|137,113.00|130,178.67|
|Gross Profit|96,936.00|86,321.00|94,210.00|92,489.00|
|**Gross Profit Ratio**|**72.69%**|**71.89%**|**68.71%**|**71.10%**|
|Net Profit|103,788.00|84,151.00|37,644.00|75,194.33|
|**Net Profit Ratio**|**77.83%**|**70.08%**|**27.45%**|**58.46%**|

However, this statistic fails to consider CCL’s substantial business interests outside of dormitories, primarily in overseas student accommodation, which accounted for 25.5% to 34.3% of their revenue over the last three years. Pulling out the numbers for just the dormitories and adjusting for one-off items, we see that CCL has earned an average of S$38.3 million per year over the last three years, substantially lower than the average S$75.2 million net profit shown above.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory Income (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

*\* For the years 2017 – 2019, between 8.1% and 12.2% of Dormitory Revenue is attributable to Dormitories in Malaysia. However, as a further breakdown of the costs & assets by geography is unavailable, we will assume that the profitability of Malaysian dormitories is the same as those of Singaporean dormitories.*

*\*\* Earnings before Interest & Taxes*

*\*\*\* Core Income excludes one-off earnings/losses borne by the company, such as through sales/purchases of assets or fair value revaluation of assets. These were excluded due to their high volatility and lack of relevance to CCL’s core business. For reference, CCL registered $66.4 million, -$12.2 million and -$3.9 million in fair value gains/losses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

In addition, profit margins are not a useful indicator when evaluating the profitability of landlords like CCL, which are asset-heavy but incur minimal operating costs. As an analogy, if you rented out a room in your house for $1,000/month, and incurred additional utility fees of $100/month, would you consider it wildly profitable given profit margins of 90%? That is similar to evaluating CCL’s profitability based on their profit margin alone.

# Return on Assets

Instead of profit margins, a more suitable indicator to evaluate landlords would be the Return on Assets (ROA), which measures the profits earned by the company as a percentage of its total assets. Applying this ratio to CCL’s worker accommodation number, we get an average ROA of 5.40%, meaning for every $100 in assets the company owns, it gets approximately $5.40 back per year.

Given the high level of leverage employed by CCL, we can also go one step further and calculate their return on equity (ROE), which accounts for borrowings and averages out to 15.06%. To provide a rough analogy, this is the equivalent of buying a $1 million house, mortgaging it for $630,000 with the bank, and then earning $4,500/month in rental income.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory ROA and ROE (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Dormitory Pre-Tax Core   Income (D)|33,673.00|34,665.00|46,437.00|38,258.33|
|Dormitory Assets (E)|796,522.00|668,193.00|685,167.00|716,627.33|
|**Core Income Pre-Tax Return on Assets (D/E)**\*|**4.23%**|**5.19%**|**6.78%**|**5.40%**|
|Dormitory Borrowings (F)|453,165.00|469,210.00|426,502.00|449,625.67|
|**Core Income Pre-Tax Return   on Equity (D/(E-F))**|**9.81%**|**17.42%**|**17.95%**|**15.06%**|

*\* I have omitted corporate tax in this table due to uncertainties over the effective tax rate paid by CCL in Singapore on Worker Dormitories. Singapore’s standard corporate tax rate is 17%. CCL as a whole paid between 6.5%, 12.9%, and 23.8% of pre-tax income in corporate tax in 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

How do these numbers stack up? Comparing these to the ROA and ROE enjoyed by a comparable industry segment in the US, we see that CCL’s ROA and ROE of 5.4% and 15.06% fall roughly in line with the US accommodations sector, which enjoyed ROA and ROE of 6.4% and 16.3%.

**US Hotels, Rooming Houses, Camps, and Other Lodging Places ROA and ROE 2017 – 2019 (Source: Ready Ratios)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Return on Assets**|11.8%|4.1%|3.3%|**6.4%**|
|**Return on Equity**|34.0%|10.2%|5.7%|**16.3%**|

Closer to home, 99.co estimates that the average rental yield in Singapore is approximately 2.3% for residential properties (or $1,900 in our above example) and 3.3% for commercial properties (or $2,750 in our above example). While the returns from worker dormitories do seem significantly higher, they also enjoy considerably shorter leases, with most of CCL’s Singapore worker dormitories subject to leases of less than 30 years at the point of development.

# Other Possible Comments

>Profits don’t matter because the towkays are extracting their money through fat salaries instead

The three largest shareholders of CCL are Loh Kim Kang David, Hang Seng Juan, and Teo Peng Kwang, owning a total of 66.15%. While their combined salary of S$1,025,000 is significant, it ultimately represents only a small portion of CCL’s total costs.

There is of course a possibility that their children/wives/siblings/grandparents may be placed in other well-paid positions within CCL, allowing them to extract more money from it. However, this information was not available in the annual reports, and thus far I have found no evidence to support this suspicion.

&#x200B;

>This analysis is flawed because it fails to take into consideration X, Y, Z factors.

This is possible, the above analysis is only based on the information contained in their 2019, 2018 and 2017 Annual Reports. There may be other relevant pieces of information, particularly surrounding the terms and purchase/development cost of their land, which were not considered.

If you have additional information which may be relevant, do comment below and I’d be happy to integrate it into the above analysis. Any feedback on how the analysis could be improved would also be appreciated. Ultimately, I hope for this to be a platform to discuss how Singapore as a society can best move forward with the worker dormitory situation.

# So What’s Next?

I’m not going to comment as to whether 5.4% ROA or 15% ROE pre-tax is a reasonable profit for a dormitory operator to make. However, I want to highlight the following – If we adjust the figures for 20% less occupancy, or the equivalent of converting all 10-man bunks into 8-man bunks, while maintaining the current level of amenities (e.g. frequency of maintenance, security systems), the ROA for last year falls from 4.23% to 2.42%.

I hope not.

I hope they all go home.

I hope we get a proud, professionally accredited local workforce of welders, concrete pumpers, crane operators and the rest, paid at a fair international rate comparable to the developed world.

I hope that one towkay who built a skyscraper in Ockerland and was stunned that it happened with a tenth of the workforce in half the time can get a similar experience in his own country one day.",2020-06-16 22:57:40

Edit: Thanks for the gold kind Redditor!","That's a good point. I took a look at the three largest industrial REITs in Singapore, Ascendas REIT, Mapletree Logistics REIT, and Mapletree Industrial REIT over the last three years, and they had ROAs between 4.50% to 6.85%, and ROEs of 6.19% to 9.27%.

While the ROA of the Industrial REITs seem similar to that of CCL, there is a large difference between the ROEs, mainly due to higher borrowings at CCL. CCL long-term dormitory borrowings equalled 56.9% of their value in 2019, whereas at the three REITs the amount was far lower.

How Profitable are Dormitory Operators Anyway? A Basic Analysis of Centurion Corporation's Financials,"Hi All,

Been seeing a lot of discussion lately about the dormitory operators and their supposedly exorbitant profits, so decided to take a deeper look at the annual reports of one of the larger players commonly mentioned, Centurion Corporation Limited (CCL), to take a look if this is indeed true.

**Tldr:**

* Profit margins are not a useful tool to evaluate CCL's profitability
* CCL's ROA and ROE of 5.40% and 15.06% are comparable to similar industries in the US
* If dormitory operators are to bear the full cost of reducing density of worker housing, ROA falls significantly to 2.42%

# Why Profit Margins are not a good indicator

When discussing the profitability of dormitory operators, a commonly statistic cited here is CCL’s profit margin of 72%. Looking at the financials, CCL did register an average gross profit ratio (GPR) of 71.10% and net profit ratio (NPR) of 58.46% over the last three years, with GPR of 72.69% and NPR of 77.83% in 2019.

**Centurion Corporation's Revenue & Profits (2017 - 2019) (S$'000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|133,353.00|120,070.00|137,113.00|130,178.67|
|Gross Profit|96,936.00|86,321.00|94,210.00|92,489.00|
|**Gross Profit Ratio**|**72.69%**|**71.89%**|**68.71%**|**71.10%**|
|Net Profit|103,788.00|84,151.00|37,644.00|75,194.33|
|**Net Profit Ratio**|**77.83%**|**70.08%**|**27.45%**|**58.46%**|

However, this statistic fails to consider CCL’s substantial business interests outside of dormitories, primarily in overseas student accommodation, which accounted for 25.5% to 34.3% of their revenue over the last three years. Pulling out the numbers for just the dormitories and adjusting for one-off items, we see that CCL has earned an average of S$38.3 million per year over the last three years, substantially lower than the average S$75.2 million net profit shown above.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory Income (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

*\* For the years 2017 – 2019, between 8.1% and 12.2% of Dormitory Revenue is attributable to Dormitories in Malaysia. However, as a further breakdown of the costs & assets by geography is unavailable, we will assume that the profitability of Malaysian dormitories is the same as those of Singaporean dormitories.*

*\*\* Earnings before Interest & Taxes*

*\*\*\* Core Income excludes one-off earnings/losses borne by the company, such as through sales/purchases of assets or fair value revaluation of assets. These were excluded due to their high volatility and lack of relevance to CCL’s core business. For reference, CCL registered $66.4 million, -$12.2 million and -$3.9 million in fair value gains/losses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

In addition, profit margins are not a useful indicator when evaluating the profitability of landlords like CCL, which are asset-heavy but incur minimal operating costs. As an analogy, if you rented out a room in your house for $1,000/month, and incurred additional utility fees of $100/month, would you consider it wildly profitable given profit margins of 90%? That is similar to evaluating CCL’s profitability based on their profit margin alone.

# Return on Assets

Instead of profit margins, a more suitable indicator to evaluate landlords would be the Return on Assets (ROA), which measures the profits earned by the company as a percentage of its total assets. Applying this ratio to CCL’s worker accommodation number, we get an average ROA of 5.40%, meaning for every $100 in assets the company owns, it gets approximately $5.40 back per year.

Given the high level of leverage employed by CCL, we can also go one step further and calculate their return on equity (ROE), which accounts for borrowings and averages out to 15.06%. To provide a rough analogy, this is the equivalent of buying a $1 million house, mortgaging it for $630,000 with the bank, and then earning $4,500/month in rental income.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory ROA and ROE (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|Dormitory Borrowings (F)|453,165.00|469,210.00|426,502.00|449,625.67|
|**Core Income Pre-Tax Return   on Equity (D/(E-F))**|**9.81%**|**17.42%**|**17.95%**|**15.06%**|

*\* I have omitted corporate tax in this table due to uncertainties over the effective tax rate paid by CCL in Singapore on Worker Dormitories. Singapore’s standard corporate tax rate is 17%. CCL as a whole paid between 6.5%, 12.9%, and 23.8% of pre-tax income in corporate tax in 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

How do these numbers stack up? Comparing these to the ROA and ROE enjoyed by a comparable industry segment in the US, we see that CCL’s ROA and ROE of 5.4% and 15.06% fall roughly in line with the US accommodations sector, which enjoyed ROA and ROE of 6.4% and 16.3%.

**US Hotels, Rooming Houses, Camps, and Other Lodging Places ROA and ROE 2017 – 2019 (Source: Ready Ratios)**

|**Return on Assets**|11.8%|4.1%|3.3%|**6.4%**|
|**Return on Equity**|34.0%|10.2%|5.7%|**16.3%**|

Closer to home, 99.co estimates that the average rental yield in Singapore is approximately 2.3% for residential properties (or $1,900 in our above example) and 3.3% for commercial properties (or $2,750 in our above example). While the returns from worker dormitories do seem significantly higher, they also enjoy considerably shorter leases, with most of CCL’s Singapore worker dormitories subject to leases of less than 30 years at the point of development.

# Other Possible Comments

>Profits don’t matter because the towkays are extracting their money through fat salaries instead

The three largest shareholders of CCL are Loh Kim Kang David, Hang Seng Juan, and Teo Peng Kwang, owning a total of 66.15%. While their combined salary of S$1,025,000 is significant, it ultimately represents only a small portion of CCL’s total costs.

There is of course a possibility that their children/wives/siblings/grandparents may be placed in other well-paid positions within CCL, allowing them to extract more money from it. However, this information was not available in the annual reports, and thus far I have found no evidence to support this suspicion.

&#x200B;

>This analysis is flawed because it fails to take into consideration X, Y, Z factors.

This is possible, the above analysis is only based on the information contained in their 2019, 2018 and 2017 Annual Reports. There may be other relevant pieces of information, particularly surrounding the terms and purchase/development cost of their land, which were not considered.

If you have additional information which may be relevant, do comment below and I’d be happy to integrate it into the above analysis. Any feedback on how the analysis could be improved would also be appreciated. Ultimately, I hope for this to be a platform to discuss how Singapore as a society can best move forward with the worker dormitory situation.

# So What’s Next?

I’m not going to comment as to whether 5.4% ROA or 15% ROE pre-tax is a reasonable profit for a dormitory operator to make. However, I want to highlight the following – If we adjust the figures for 20% less occupancy, or the equivalent of converting all 10-man bunks into 8-man bunks, while maintaining the current level of amenities (e.g. frequency of maintenance, security systems), the ROA for last year falls from 4.23% to 2.42%.

*\* For the purposes of this calculation, $11,272.66 or 36.5% of Operating Expenses were considered variable costs, and scaled down accordingly. These comprised of Property Tax, Utilities, Transportation Expenses, Impairment Allowance, Raw Materials & Consumables, Changes in Inventories and Other Costs. S$19,611 or 63.5% of Operating Expenses were considered as fixed costs, comprising of Depreciation, Employee Compensation, Rental Expenses, Repairs & Maintenance, Insurance, Security Systems, and Professional Service Fees.*

&#x200B;

While with sufficient political will it may be possible to strong-arm current dormitory operators to improve the living conditions of foreign workers living in dormitories without increasing their prices, the challenge comes in providing additional living spaces for the 20% of foreign workers who are now displaced from their old dorms. Would 2.42% pre-tax ROA be sufficient to entice new investors to build foreign worker dormitories?

Edit: Thanks for the gold kind Redditor!","Thanks for your comments, they're very good points.

On OM, I see what you mean by the value in using it as a key indicator, but I would argue that CCL would also fall under the category of companies with low operating expenses. Comparing it to a similar asset class - the 3 largest Industrial REITs in Singapore, we see that CCL's OM is roughly in line with theirs, and indeed a little on the low side. Financing cost is also not included in OM.

**Operating Margin of Industrial REITs in Singapore (2017 - 2019)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|**Mapletree Ind REIT**|76.51%|76.43%|75.41%|76.12%|

This high OM seems to be mostly attributable to low depreciation costs. On depreciation, looking deeper CCL as a whole registered $3,113,000 (or 0.24% per annum) in depreciation expenses in 2019, of which only $607,000 (or 0.048% per annum) were attributable to their main assets, their buildings, on long-term property assets of $1,275,879,000 which seems a little low.

Been seeing a lot of discussion lately about the dormitory operators and their supposedly exorbitant profits, so decided to take a deeper look at the annual reports of one of the larger players commonly mentioned, Centurion Corporation Limited (CCL), to take a look if this is indeed true.

**Tldr:**

* Profit margins are not a useful tool to evaluate CCL's profitability
* CCL's ROA and ROE of 5.40% and 15.06% are comparable to similar industries in the US
* If dormitory operators are to bear the full cost of reducing density of worker housing, ROA falls significantly to 2.42%

# Why Profit Margins are not a good indicator

When discussing the profitability of dormitory operators, a commonly statistic cited here is CCL’s profit margin of 72%. Looking at the financials, CCL did register an average gross profit ratio (GPR) of 71.10% and net profit ratio (NPR) of 58.46% over the last three years, with GPR of 72.69% and NPR of 77.83% in 2019.

**Centurion Corporation's Revenue & Profits (2017 - 2019) (S$'000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|133,353.00|120,070.00|137,113.00|130,178.67|
|Gross Profit|96,936.00|86,321.00|94,210.00|92,489.00|
|**Gross Profit Ratio**|**72.69%**|**71.89%**|**68.71%**|**71.10%**|
|Net Profit|103,788.00|84,151.00|37,644.00|75,194.33|
|**Net Profit Ratio**|**77.83%**|**70.08%**|**27.45%**|**58.46%**|

However, this statistic fails to consider CCL’s substantial business interests outside of dormitories, primarily in overseas student accommodation, which accounted for 25.5% to 34.3% of their revenue over the last three years. Pulling out the numbers for just the dormitories and adjusting for one-off items, we see that CCL has earned an average of S$38.3 million per year over the last three years, substantially lower than the average S$75.2 million net profit shown above.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory Income (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Dormitory Revenue\* (A)|83,114.00|80,605.00|100,397.00|**88,038.67**|

*\* For the years 2017 – 2019, between 8.1% and 12.2% of Dormitory Revenue is attributable to Dormitories in Malaysia. However, as a further breakdown of the costs & assets by geography is unavailable, we will assume that the profitability of Malaysian dormitories is the same as those of Singaporean dormitories.*

*\*\* Earnings before Interest & Taxes*

*\*\*\* Core Income excludes one-off earnings/losses borne by the company, such as through sales/purchases of assets or fair value revaluation of assets. These were excluded due to their high volatility and lack of relevance to CCL’s core business. For reference, CCL registered $66.4 million, -$12.2 million and -$3.9 million in fair value gains/losses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

In addition, profit margins are not a useful indicator when evaluating the profitability of landlords like CCL, which are asset-heavy but incur minimal operating costs. As an analogy, if you rented out a room in your house for $1,000/month, and incurred additional utility fees of $100/month, would you consider it wildly profitable given profit margins of 90%? That is similar to evaluating CCL’s profitability based on their profit margin alone.

# Return on Assets

Instead of profit margins, a more suitable indicator to evaluate landlords would be the Return on Assets (ROA), which measures the profits earned by the company as a percentage of its total assets. Applying this ratio to CCL’s worker accommodation number, we get an average ROA of 5.40%, meaning for every $100 in assets the company owns, it gets approximately $5.40 back per year.

Given the high level of leverage employed by CCL, we can also go one step further and calculate their return on equity (ROE), which accounts for borrowings and averages out to 15.06%. To provide a rough analogy, this is the equivalent of buying a $1 million house, mortgaging it for $630,000 with the bank, and then earning $4,500/month in rental income.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory ROA and ROE (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Dormitory Pre-Tax Core   Income (D)|33,673.00|34,665.00|46,437.00|38,258.33|
|Dormitory Assets (E)|796,522.00|668,193.00|685,167.00|716,627.33|
|**Core Income Pre-Tax Return on Assets (D/E)**\*|**4.23%**|**5.19%**|**6.78%**|**5.40%**|
|Dormitory Borrowings (F)|453,165.00|469,210.00|426,502.00|449,625.67|
|**Core Income Pre-Tax Return   on Equity (D/(E-F))**|**9.81%**|**17.42%**|**17.95%**|**15.06%**|

*\* I have omitted corporate tax in this table due to uncertainties over the effective tax rate paid by CCL in Singapore on Worker Dormitories. Singapore’s standard corporate tax rate is 17%. CCL as a whole paid between 6.5%, 12.9%, and 23.8% of pre-tax income in corporate tax in 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

How do these numbers stack up? Comparing these to the ROA and ROE enjoyed by a comparable industry segment in the US, we see that CCL’s ROA and ROE of 5.4% and 15.06% fall roughly in line with the US accommodations sector, which enjoyed ROA and ROE of 6.4% and 16.3%.

**US Hotels, Rooming Houses, Camps, and Other Lodging Places ROA and ROE 2017 – 2019 (Source: Ready Ratios)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Return on Assets**|11.8%|4.1%|3.3%|**6.4%**|
|**Return on Equity**|34.0%|10.2%|5.7%|**16.3%**|

Closer to home, 99.co estimates that the average rental yield in Singapore is approximately 2.3% for residential properties (or $1,900 in our above example) and 3.3% for commercial properties (or $2,750 in our above example). While the returns from worker dormitories do seem significantly higher, they also enjoy considerably shorter leases, with most of CCL’s Singapore worker dormitories subject to leases of less than 30 years at the point of development.

# Other Possible Comments

>Profits don’t matter because the towkays are extracting their money through fat salaries instead

The three largest shareholders of CCL are Loh Kim Kang David, Hang Seng Juan, and Teo Peng Kwang, owning a total of 66.15%. While their combined salary of S$1,025,000 is significant, it ultimately represents only a small portion of CCL’s total costs.

There is of course a possibility that their children/wives/siblings/grandparents may be placed in other well-paid positions within CCL, allowing them to extract more money from it. However, this information was not available in the annual reports, and thus far I have found no evidence to support this suspicion.

&#x200B;

>This analysis is flawed because it fails to take into consideration X, Y, Z factors.

This is possible, the above analysis is only based on the information contained in their 2019, 2018 and 2017 Annual Reports. There may be other relevant pieces of information, particularly surrounding the terms and purchase/development cost of their land, which were not considered.

If you have additional information which may be relevant, do comment below and I’d be happy to integrate it into the above analysis. Any feedback on how the analysis could be improved would also be appreciated. Ultimately, I hope for this to be a platform to discuss how Singapore as a society can best move forward with the worker dormitory situation.

# So What’s Next?

I’m not going to comment as to whether 5.4% ROA or 15% ROE pre-tax is a reasonable profit for a dormitory operator to make. However, I want to highlight the following – If we adjust the figures for 20% less occupancy, or the equivalent of converting all 10-man bunks into 8-man bunks, while maintaining the current level of amenities (e.g. frequency of maintenance, security systems), the ROA for last year falls from 4.23% to 2.42%.

**Figures Adjusted for 20% Less Occupancy (2019)**

|**Core Income Pre-Tax Return on Assets**|**4.23%**|**2.42%**|

*\* For the purposes of this calculation, $11,272.66 or 36.5% of Operating Expenses were considered variable costs, and scaled down accordingly. These comprised of Property Tax, Utilities, Transportation Expenses, Impairment Allowance, Raw Materials & Consumables, Changes in Inventories and Other Costs. S$19,611 or 63.5% of Operating Expenses were considered as fixed costs, comprising of Depreciation, Employee Compensation, Rental Expenses, Repairs & Maintenance, Insurance, Security Systems, and Professional Service Fees.*

&#x200B;

While with sufficient political will it may be possible to strong-arm current dormitory operators to improve the living conditions of foreign workers living in dormitories without increasing their prices, the challenge comes in providing additional living spaces for the 20% of foreign workers who are now displaced from their old dorms. Would 2.42% pre-tax ROA be sufficient to entice new investors to build foreign worker dormitories?

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for the gold kind Redditor!","For business, it's always about P&L. Social pressure is mainly a consideration as a factor of brand value, which again translates to P&L.

There are profitable but socially awkward businesses, e.g. cigarettes, prostitution, social escort, weapons manufacturing. Despite the social pressure, the business operators continue because of profits.

> Actually it’s not about the operators not wanting to give the residents decent life 

They do, but never at the expense of P&L. If the operators can squeeze in 20 people in a small room, they will. It's only the government regulations which prevent them.

The issue is not about the social objections. 

>We already have seen the faces of few masters on how they treat their maids. 

Please be mindful of *Negativity Bias*. Bad news sell better, that's a fact. This gives the false impression that Singaporeans are abusing their FDW regularly. In truth, Singaporeans are just like any other employers in other parts of the world. There are a few abusive ones, but the majority are compassionate people.

In fact, close to [8 in 10 Singaporeans](http://www.ilo.org/asia/publications/WCMS_732443/lang--en/index.htm) are were in favour of improved labour conditions for foreign domestic workers (FDW). 

It is not lack of popular support for better welfare of FW. It's the lack of political willpower. The government is being weighed down by an important but low productivity industry (construction) for many years. Singapore construction sector is 30% less productive than Japan. Using a simplified reduction, the density of the dorm here can be reduced by 30% if we reach the productivity level of Japan.

Looking at the financials, CCL did register an average gross profit ratio (GPR) of 71.10% and net profit ratio (NPR) of 58.46% over the last three years, with GPR of 72.69% and NPR of 77.83% in 2019.

**Centurion Corporation's Revenue & Profits (2017 - 2019) (S$'000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|

|**Net Profit Ratio**|**77.83%**|**70.08%**|**27.45%**|**58.46%**|

However, this statistic fails to consider CCL’s substantial business interests outside of dormitories, primarily in overseas student accommodation, which accounted for 25.5% to 34.3% of their revenue over the last three years. Pulling out the numbers for just the dormitories and adjusting for one-off items, we see that CCL has earned an average of S$38.3 million per year over the last three years, substantially lower than the average S$75.2 million net profit shown above.

*\* For the years 2017 – 2019, between 8.1% and 12.2% of Dormitory Revenue is attributable to Dormitories in Malaysia. However, as a further breakdown of the costs & assets by geography is unavailable, we will assume that the profitability of Malaysian dormitories is the same as those of Singaporean dormitories.*

*\*\* Earnings before Interest & Taxes*

*\*\*\* Core Income excludes one-off earnings/losses borne by the company, such as through sales/purchases of assets or fair value revaluation of assets. These were excluded due to their high volatility and lack of relevance to CCL’s core business. For reference, CCL registered $66.4 million, -$12.2 million and -$3.9 million in fair value gains/losses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

In addition, profit margins are not a useful indicator when evaluating the profitability of landlords like CCL, which are asset-heavy but incur minimal operating costs. As an analogy, if you rented out a room in your house for $1,000/month, and incurred additional utility fees of $100/month, would you consider it wildly profitable given profit margins of 90%? That is similar to evaluating CCL’s profitability based on their profit margin alone.

# Return on Assets

Instead of profit margins, a more suitable indicator to evaluate landlords would be the Return on Assets (ROA), which measures the profits earned by the company as a percentage of its total assets. Applying this ratio to CCL’s worker accommodation number, we get an average ROA of 5.40%, meaning for every $100 in assets the company owns, it gets approximately $5.40 back per year.

Given the high level of leverage employed by CCL, we can also go one step further and calculate their return on equity (ROE), which accounts for borrowings and averages out to 15.06%. To provide a rough analogy, this is the equivalent of buying a $1 million house, mortgaging it for $630,000 with the bank, and then earning $4,500/month in rental income.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory ROA and ROE (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|Dormitory Borrowings (F)|453,165.00|469,210.00|426,502.00|449,625.67|
|**Core Income Pre-Tax Return   on Equity (D/(E-F))**|**9.81%**|**17.42%**|**17.95%**|**15.06%**|

*\* I have omitted corporate tax in this table due to uncertainties over the effective tax rate paid by CCL in Singapore on Worker Dormitories. Singapore’s standard corporate tax rate is 17%. CCL as a whole paid between 6.5%, 12.9%, and 23.8% of pre-tax income in corporate tax in 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

How do these numbers stack up? Comparing these to the ROA and ROE enjoyed by a comparable industry segment in the US, we see that CCL’s ROA and ROE of 5.4% and 15.06% fall roughly in line with the US accommodations sector, which enjoyed ROA and ROE of 6.4% and 16.3%.

**US Hotels, Rooming Houses, Camps, and Other Lodging Places ROA and ROE 2017 – 2019 (Source: Ready Ratios)**

|**Return on Assets**|11.8%|4.1%|3.3%|**6.4%**|
|**Return on Equity**|34.0%|10.2%|5.7%|**16.3%**|

Closer to home, 99.co estimates that the average rental yield in Singapore is approximately 2.3% for residential properties (or $1,900 in our above example) and 3.3% for commercial properties (or $2,750 in our above example). While the returns from worker dormitories do seem significantly higher, they also enjoy considerably shorter leases, with most of CCL’s Singapore worker dormitories subject to leases of less than 30 years at the point of development.

The three largest shareholders of CCL are Loh Kim Kang David, Hang Seng Juan, and Teo Peng Kwang, owning a total of 66.15%. While their combined salary of S$1,025,000 is significant, it ultimately represents only a small portion of CCL’s total costs.

There is of course a possibility that their children/wives/siblings/grandparents may be placed in other well-paid positions within CCL, allowing them to extract more money from it. However, this information was not available in the annual reports, and thus far I have found no evidence to support this suspicion.

&#x200B;

>This analysis is flawed because it fails to take into consideration X, Y, Z factors.

This is possible, the above analysis is only based on the information contained in their 2019, 2018 and 2017 Annual Reports. There may be other relevant pieces of information, particularly surrounding the terms and purchase/development cost of their land, which were not considered.

If you have additional information which may be relevant, do comment below and I’d be happy to integrate it into the above analysis. Any feedback on how the analysis could be improved would also be appreciated. Ultimately, I hope for this to be a platform to discuss how Singapore as a society can best move forward with the worker dormitory situation.

# So What’s Next?

I’m not going to comment as to whether 5.4% ROA or 15% ROE pre-tax is a reasonable profit for a dormitory operator to make. However, I want to highlight the following – If we adjust the figures for 20% less occupancy, or the equivalent of converting all 10-man bunks into 8-man bunks, while maintaining the current level of amenities (e.g. frequency of maintenance, security systems), the ROA for last year falls from 4.23% to 2.42%.

These comprised of Property Tax, Utilities, Transportation Expenses, Impairment Allowance, Raw Materials & Consumables, Changes in Inventories and Other Costs. S$19,611 or 63.5% of Operating Expenses were considered as fixed costs, comprising of Depreciation, Employee Compensation, Rental Expenses, Repairs & Maintenance, Insurance, Security Systems, and Professional Service Fees.*

While with sufficient political will it may be possible to strong-arm current dormitory operators to improve the living conditions of foreign workers living in dormitories without increasing their prices, the challenge comes in providing additional living spaces for the 20% of foreign workers who are now displaced from their old dorms. Would 2.42% pre-tax ROA be sufficient to entice new investors to build foreign worker dormitories?

&#x200B;

In addition, profit margins are not a useful indicator when evaluating the profitability of landlords like CCL, which are asset-heavy but incur minimal operating costs. As an analogy, if you rented out a room in your house for $1,000/month, and incurred additional utility fees of $100/month, would you consider it wildly profitable given profit margins of 90%? That is similar to evaluating CCL’s profitability based on their profit margin alone.

# Return on Assets

Instead of profit margins, a more suitable indicator to evaluate landlords would be the Return on Assets (ROA), which measures the profits earned by the company as a percentage of its total assets. Applying this ratio to CCL’s worker accommodation number, we get an average ROA of 5.40%, meaning for every $100 in assets the company owns, it gets approximately $5.40 back per year.

Given the high level of leverage employed by CCL, we can also go one step further and calculate their return on equity (ROE), which accounts for borrowings and averages out to 15.06%. To provide a rough analogy, this is the equivalent of buying a $1 million house, mortgaging it for $630,000 with the bank, and then earning $4,500/month in rental income.

*\* I have omitted corporate tax in this table due to uncertainties over the effective tax rate paid by CCL in Singapore on Worker Dormitories. Singapore’s standard corporate tax rate is 17%. CCL as a whole paid between 6.5%, 12.9%, and 23.8% of pre-tax income in corporate tax in 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

How do these numbers stack up? Comparing these to the ROA and ROE enjoyed by a comparable industry segment in the US, we see that CCL’s ROA and ROE of 5.4% and 15.06% fall roughly in line with the US accommodations sector, which enjoyed ROA and ROE of 6.4% and 16.3%.

**US Hotels, Rooming Houses, Camps, and Other Lodging Places ROA and ROE 2017 – 2019 (Source: Ready Ratios)**

|**Return on Equity**|34.0%|10.2%|5.7%|**16.3%**|

Closer to home, 99.co estimates that the average rental yield in Singapore is approximately 2.3% for residential properties (or $1,900 in our above example) and 3.3% for commercial properties (or $2,750 in our above example). While the returns from worker dormitories do seem significantly higher, they also enjoy considerably shorter leases, with most of CCL’s Singapore worker dormitories subject to leases of less than 30 years at the point of development.

The three largest shareholders of CCL are Loh Kim Kang David, Hang Seng Juan, and Teo Peng Kwang, owning a total of 66.15%. While their combined salary of S$1,025,000 is significant, it ultimately represents only a small portion of CCL’s total costs.

There is of course a possibility that their children/wives/siblings/grandparents may be placed in other well-paid positions within CCL, allowing them to extract more money from it. However, this information was not available in the annual reports, and thus far I have found no evidence to support this suspicion.

# So What’s Next?

I’m not going to comment as to whether 5.4% ROA or 15% ROE pre-tax is a reasonable profit for a dormitory operator to make. However, I want to highlight the following – If we adjust the figures for 20% less occupancy, or the equivalent of converting all 10-man bunks into 8-man bunks, while maintaining the current level of amenities (e.g. frequency of maintenance, security systems), the ROA for last year falls from 4.23% to 2.42%.

While with sufficient political will it may be possible to strong-arm current dormitory operators to improve the living conditions of foreign workers living in dormitories without increasing their prices, the challenge comes in providing additional living spaces for the 20% of foreign workers who are now displaced from their old dorms. Would 2.42% pre-tax ROA be sufficient to entice new investors to build foreign worker dormitories?

How Profitable are Dormitory Operators Anyway? A Basic Analysis of Centurion Corporation's Financials,"Hi All,

Been seeing a lot of discussion lately about the dormitory operators and their supposedly exorbitant profits, so decided to take a deeper look at the annual reports of one of the larger players commonly mentioned, Centurion Corporation Limited (CCL), to take a look if this is indeed true.

**Tldr:**

* Profit margins are not a useful tool to evaluate CCL's profitability
* CCL's ROA and ROE of 5.40% and 15.06% are comparable to similar industries in the US
* If dormitory operators are to bear the full cost of reducing density of worker housing, ROA falls significantly to 2.42%

# Why Profit Margins are not a good indicator

When discussing the profitability of dormitory operators, a commonly statistic cited here is CCL’s profit margin of 72%. Looking at the financials, CCL did register an average gross profit ratio (GPR) of 71.10% and net profit ratio (NPR) of 58.46% over the last three years, with GPR of 72.69% and NPR of 77.83% in 2019.

**Centurion Corporation's Revenue & Profits (2017 - 2019) (S$'000)**

|**Net Profit Ratio**|**77.83%**|**70.08%**|**27.45%**|**58.46%**|

However, this statistic fails to consider CCL’s substantial business interests outside of dormitories, primarily in overseas student accommodation, which accounted for 25.5% to 34.3% of their revenue over the last three years. Pulling out the numbers for just the dormitories and adjusting for one-off items, we see that CCL has earned an average of S$38.3 million per year over the last three years, substantially lower than the average S$75.2 million net profit shown above.

Edit: Thanks for the gold kind Redditor!","> I am sure without significant $$$, they are not going to have weekend bungalows in sentosa or multi million $ houses. 

For the Sentosa reference, I think this was a really great misdirection by TOC - they wrote [an article](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fz68nh/foreign_worker_dormitories_with_active_covid19/) suggesting (but not saying) Han earns enough money from his involvement in foreign worker dorms to support the Sentosa home. But (a) the TOC article says that Sentosa home was built in 2012 (b) Han only joined Centurion Corp in [2015](https://www.centurioncorp.com.sg/about-us/board-of-directors/) and (c) OP's post points out that Han earned $46,000 in 2019. This is per annum. 

You can look through Centurion Corp's annual reports (it's also on their website), but it's unlikely that the Sentosa Cove home was funded by Han's involvement as a director in Centurion Corp. It does fit the narrative though, so I have to give TOC that.",2020-06-17 10:41:10

&#x200B;

In addition, profit margins are not a useful indicator when evaluating the profitability of landlords like CCL, which are asset-heavy but incur minimal operating costs. As an analogy, if you rented out a room in your house for $1,000/month, and incurred additional utility fees of $100/month, would you consider it wildly profitable given profit margins of 90%? That is similar to evaluating CCL’s profitability based on their profit margin alone.

# Return on Assets

Instead of profit margins, a more suitable indicator to evaluate landlords would be the Return on Assets (ROA), which measures the profits earned by the company as a percentage of its total assets. Applying this ratio to CCL’s worker accommodation number, we get an average ROA of 5.40%, meaning for every $100 in assets the company owns, it gets approximately $5.40 back per year.

Given the high level of leverage employed by CCL, we can also go one step further and calculate their return on equity (ROE), which accounts for borrowings and averages out to 15.06%. To provide a rough analogy, this is the equivalent of buying a $1 million house, mortgaging it for $630,000 with the bank, and then earning $4,500/month in rental income.

*\* I have omitted corporate tax in this table due to uncertainties over the effective tax rate paid by CCL in Singapore on Worker Dormitories. Singapore’s standard corporate tax rate is 17%. CCL as a whole paid between 6.5%, 12.9%, and 23.8% of pre-tax income in corporate tax in 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

How do these numbers stack up? Comparing these to the ROA and ROE enjoyed by a comparable industry segment in the US, we see that CCL’s ROA and ROE of 5.4% and 15.06% fall roughly in line with the US accommodations sector, which enjoyed ROA and ROE of 6.4% and 16.3%.

**US Hotels, Rooming Houses, Camps, and Other Lodging Places ROA and ROE 2017 – 2019 (Source: Ready Ratios)**

|**Return on Equity**|34.0%|10.2%|5.7%|**16.3%**|

Closer to home, 99.co estimates that the average rental yield in Singapore is approximately 2.3% for residential properties (or $1,900 in our above example) and 3.3% for commercial properties (or $2,750 in our above example). While the returns from worker dormitories do seem significantly higher, they also enjoy considerably shorter leases, with most of CCL’s Singapore worker dormitories subject to leases of less than 30 years at the point of development.

The three largest shareholders of CCL are Loh Kim Kang David, Hang Seng Juan, and Teo Peng Kwang, owning a total of 66.15%. While their combined salary of S$1,025,000 is significant, it ultimately represents only a small portion of CCL’s total costs.

There is of course a possibility that their children/wives/siblings/grandparents may be placed in other well-paid positions within CCL, allowing them to extract more money from it. However, this information was not available in the annual reports, and thus far I have found no evidence to support this suspicion.

This is possible, the above analysis is only based on the information contained in their 2019, 2018 and 2017 Annual Reports. There may be other relevant pieces of information, particularly surrounding the terms and purchase/development cost of their land, which were not considered.

Any feedback on how the analysis could be improved would also be appreciated.

# So What’s Next?

I’m not going to comment as to whether 5.4% ROA or 15% ROE pre-tax is a reasonable profit for a dormitory operator to make. However, I want to highlight the following – If we adjust the figures for 20% less occupancy, or the equivalent of converting all 10-man bunks into 8-man bunks, while maintaining the current level of amenities (e.g. frequency of maintenance, security systems), the ROA for last year falls from 4.23% to 2.42%.

While with sufficient political will it may be possible to strong-arm current dormitory operators to improve the living conditions of foreign workers living in dormitories without increasing their prices, the challenge comes in providing additional living spaces for the 20% of foreign workers who are now displaced from their old dorms. Would 2.42% pre-tax ROA be sufficient to entice new investors to build foreign worker dormitories?

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for the gold kind Redditor!","Fully agreed that profit margins cannot be the only point of consideration here - it is after all people's basic welfare that we are talking about. However, this will come at a cost which someone (be it the company, the public, or the government) will have to bear at some point.

Inflated asset prices is certainly a possibility, though data on this is lacking. ROCE would also not help to resolve this issue as any potentially inflated asset prices would also be baked in.

How Profitable are Dormitory Operators Anyway? A Basic Analysis of Centurion Corporation's Financials,"Hi All,

Been seeing a lot of discussion lately about the dormitory operators and their supposedly exorbitant profits, so decided to take a deeper look at the annual reports of one of the larger players commonly mentioned, Centurion Corporation Limited (CCL), to take a look if this is indeed true.

**Tldr:**

* Profit margins are not a useful tool to evaluate CCL's profitability
* CCL's ROA and ROE of 5.40% and 15.06% are comparable to similar industries in the US
* If dormitory operators are to bear the full cost of reducing density of worker housing, ROA falls significantly to 2.42%

# Why Profit Margins are not a good indicator

When discussing the profitability of dormitory operators, a commonly statistic cited here is CCL’s profit margin of 72%. Looking at the financials, CCL did register an average gross profit ratio (GPR) of 71.10% and net profit ratio (NPR) of 58.46% over the last three years, with GPR of 72.69% and NPR of 77.83% in 2019.

**Centurion Corporation's Revenue & Profits (2017 - 2019) (S$'000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|

|**Net Profit Ratio**|**77.83%**|**70.08%**|**27.45%**|**58.46%**|

However, this statistic fails to consider CCL’s substantial business interests outside of dormitories, primarily in overseas student accommodation, which accounted for 25.5% to 34.3% of their revenue over the last three years. Pulling out the numbers for just the dormitories and adjusting for one-off items, we see that CCL has earned an average of S$38.3 million per year over the last three years, substantially lower than the average S$75.2 million net profit shown above.

However, as a further breakdown of the costs & assets by geography is unavailable, we will assume that the profitability of Malaysian dormitories is the same as those of Singaporean dormitories.*

*\*\* Earnings before Interest & Taxes*

*\*\*\* Core Income excludes one-off earnings/losses borne by the company, such as through sales/purchases of assets or fair value revaluation of assets.

While the returns from worker dormitories do seem significantly higher, they also enjoy considerably shorter leases, with most of CCL’s Singapore worker dormitories subject to leases of less than 30 years at the point of development.

The three largest shareholders of CCL are Loh Kim Kang David, Hang Seng Juan, and Teo Peng Kwang, owning a total of 66.15%. While their combined salary of S$1,025,000 is significant, it ultimately represents only a small portion of CCL’s total costs.

There is of course a possibility that their children/wives/siblings/grandparents may be placed in other well-paid positions within CCL, allowing them to extract more money from it. However, this information was not available in the annual reports, and thus far I have found no evidence to support this suspicion.

# So What’s Next?

I’m not going to comment as to whether 5.4% ROA or 15% ROE pre-tax is a reasonable profit for a dormitory operator to make. However, I want to highlight the following – If we adjust the figures for 20% less occupancy, or the equivalent of converting all 10-man bunks into 8-man bunks, while maintaining the current level of amenities (e.g. frequency of maintenance, security systems), the ROA for last year falls from 4.23% to 2.42%.

While with sufficient political will it may be possible to strong-arm current dormitory operators to improve the living conditions of foreign workers living in dormitories without increasing their prices, the challenge comes in providing additional living spaces for the 20% of foreign workers who are now displaced from their old dorms. Would 2.42% pre-tax ROA be sufficient to entice new investors to build foreign worker dormitories?

How Profitable are Dormitory Operators Anyway? A Basic Analysis of Centurion Corporation's Financials,"Hi All,

Been seeing a lot of discussion lately about the dormitory operators and their supposedly exorbitant profits, so decided to take a deeper look at the annual reports of one of the larger players commonly mentioned, Centurion Corporation Limited (CCL), to take a look if this is indeed true.

**Tldr:**

* Profit margins are not a useful tool to evaluate CCL's profitability
* CCL's ROA and ROE of 5.40% and 15.06% are comparable to similar industries in the US
* If dormitory operators are to bear the full cost of reducing density of worker housing, ROA falls significantly to 2.42%

# Why Profit Margins are not a good indicator

When discussing the profitability of dormitory operators, a commonly statistic cited here is CCL’s profit margin of 72%. Looking at the financials, CCL did register an average gross profit ratio (GPR) of 71.10% and net profit ratio (NPR) of 58.46% over the last three years, with GPR of 72.69% and NPR of 77.83% in 2019.

**Centurion Corporation's Revenue & Profits (2017 - 2019) (S$'000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|133,353.00|120,070.00|137,113.00|130,178.67|
|Gross Profit|96,936.00|86,321.00|94,210.00|92,489.00|
|**Gross Profit Ratio**|**72.69%**|**71.89%**|**68.71%**|**71.10%**|
|Net Profit|103,788.00|84,151.00|37,644.00|75,194.33|
|**Net Profit Ratio**|**77.83%**|**70.08%**|**27.45%**|**58.46%**|

However, this statistic fails to consider CCL’s substantial business interests outside of dormitories, primarily in overseas student accommodation, which accounted for 25.5% to 34.3% of their revenue over the last three years. Pulling out the numbers for just the dormitories and adjusting for one-off items, we see that CCL has earned an average of S$38.3 million per year over the last three years, substantially lower than the average S$75.2 million net profit shown above.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory Income (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

*\* For the years 2017 – 2019, between 8.1% and 12.2% of Dormitory Revenue is attributable to Dormitories in Malaysia. However, as a further breakdown of the costs & assets by geography is unavailable, we will assume that the profitability of Malaysian dormitories is the same as those of Singaporean dormitories.*

*\*\* Earnings before Interest & Taxes*

*\*\*\* Core Income excludes one-off earnings/losses borne by the company, such as through sales/purchases of assets or fair value revaluation of assets. These were excluded due to their high volatility and lack of relevance to CCL’s core business. For reference, CCL registered $66.4 million, -$12.2 million and -$3.9 million in fair value gains/losses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

In addition, profit margins are not a useful indicator when evaluating the profitability of landlords like CCL, which are asset-heavy but incur minimal operating costs. As an analogy, if you rented out a room in your house for $1,000/month, and incurred additional utility fees of $100/month, would you consider it wildly profitable given profit margins of 90%? That is similar to evaluating CCL’s profitability based on their profit margin alone.

# Return on Assets

Instead of profit margins, a more suitable indicator to evaluate landlords would be the Return on Assets (ROA), which measures the profits earned by the company as a percentage of its total assets. Applying this ratio to CCL’s worker accommodation number, we get an average ROA of 5.40%, meaning for every $100 in assets the company owns, it gets approximately $5.40 back per year.

Given the high level of leverage employed by CCL, we can also go one step further and calculate their return on equity (ROE), which accounts for borrowings and averages out to 15.06%. To provide a rough analogy, this is the equivalent of buying a $1 million house, mortgaging it for $630,000 with the bank, and then earning $4,500/month in rental income.

While the returns from worker dormitories do seem significantly higher, they also enjoy considerably shorter leases, with most of CCL’s Singapore worker dormitories subject to leases of less than 30 years at the point of development.

The three largest shareholders of CCL are Loh Kim Kang David, Hang Seng Juan, and Teo Peng Kwang, owning a total of 66.15%. While their combined salary of S$1,025,000 is significant, it ultimately represents only a small portion of CCL’s total costs.

There is of course a possibility that their children/wives/siblings/grandparents may be placed in other well-paid positions within CCL, allowing them to extract more money from it. However, this information was not available in the annual reports, and thus far I have found no evidence to support this suspicion.

# So What’s Next?

I’m not going to comment as to whether 5.4% ROA or 15% ROE pre-tax is a reasonable profit for a dormitory operator to make. However, I want to highlight the following – If we adjust the figures for 20% less occupancy, or the equivalent of converting all 10-man bunks into 8-man bunks, while maintaining the current level of amenities (e.g. frequency of maintenance, security systems), the ROA for last year falls from 4.23% to 2.42%.

While with sufficient political will it may be possible to strong-arm current dormitory operators to improve the living conditions of foreign workers living in dormitories without increasing their prices, the challenge comes in providing additional living spaces for the 20% of foreign workers who are now displaced from their old dorms. Would 2.42% pre-tax ROA be sufficient to entice new investors to build foreign worker dormitories?

How Profitable are Dormitory Operators Anyway? A Basic Analysis of Centurion Corporation's Financials,"Hi All,

Been seeing a lot of discussion lately about the dormitory operators and their supposedly exorbitant profits, so decided to take a deeper look at the annual reports of one of the larger players commonly mentioned, Centurion Corporation Limited (CCL), to take a look if this is indeed true.

**Tldr:**

* Profit margins are not a useful tool to evaluate CCL's profitability
* CCL's ROA and ROE of 5.40% and 15.06% are comparable to similar industries in the US
* If dormitory operators are to bear the full cost of reducing density of worker housing, ROA falls significantly to 2.42%

# Why Profit Margins are not a good indicator

When discussing the profitability of dormitory operators, a commonly statistic cited here is CCL’s profit margin of 72%. Looking at the financials, CCL did register an average gross profit ratio (GPR) of 71.10% and net profit ratio (NPR) of 58.46% over the last three years, with GPR of 72.69% and NPR of 77.83% in 2019.

**Centurion Corporation's Revenue & Profits (2017 - 2019) (S$'000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|133,353.00|120,070.00|137,113.00|130,178.67|
|Gross Profit|96,936.00|86,321.00|94,210.00|92,489.00|
|**Gross Profit Ratio**|**72.69%**|**71.89%**|**68.71%**|**71.10%**|
|Net Profit|103,788.00|84,151.00|37,644.00|75,194.33|
|**Net Profit Ratio**|**77.83%**|**70.08%**|**27.45%**|**58.46%**|

However, this statistic fails to consider CCL’s substantial business interests outside of dormitories, primarily in overseas student accommodation, which accounted for 25.5% to 34.3% of their revenue over the last three years. Pulling out the numbers for just the dormitories and adjusting for one-off items, we see that CCL has earned an average of S$38.3 million per year over the last three years, substantially lower than the average S$75.2 million net profit shown above.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory Income (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Dormitory Revenue\* (A)|83,114.00|80,605.00|100,397.00|**88,038.67**|

*\* For the years 2017 – 2019, between 8.1% and 12.2% of Dormitory Revenue is attributable to Dormitories in Malaysia. However, as a further breakdown of the costs & assets by geography is unavailable, we will assume that the profitability of Malaysian dormitories is the same as those of Singaporean dormitories.*

*\*\* Earnings before Interest & Taxes*

*\*\*\* Core Income excludes one-off earnings/losses borne by the company, such as through sales/purchases of assets or fair value revaluation of assets. These were excluded due to their high volatility and lack of relevance to CCL’s core business. For reference, CCL registered $66.4 million, -$12.2 million and -$3.9 million in fair value gains/losses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

In addition, profit margins are not a useful indicator when evaluating the profitability of landlords like CCL, which are asset-heavy but incur minimal operating costs. As an analogy, if you rented out a room in your house for $1,000/month, and incurred additional utility fees of $100/month, would you consider it wildly profitable given profit margins of 90%? That is similar to evaluating CCL’s profitability based on their profit margin alone.

# Return on Assets

Instead of profit margins, a more suitable indicator to evaluate landlords would be the Return on Assets (ROA), which measures the profits earned by the company as a percentage of its total assets. Applying this ratio to CCL’s worker accommodation number, we get an average ROA of 5.40%, meaning for every $100 in assets the company owns, it gets approximately $5.40 back per year.

Given the high level of leverage employed by CCL, we can also go one step further and calculate their return on equity (ROE), which accounts for borrowings and averages out to 15.06%. To provide a rough analogy, this is the equivalent of buying a $1 million house, mortgaging it for $630,000 with the bank, and then earning $4,500/month in rental income.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory ROA and ROE (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Dormitory Pre-Tax Core   Income (D)|33,673.00|34,665.00|46,437.00|38,258.33|
|Dormitory Assets (E)|796,522.00|668,193.00|685,167.00|716,627.33|
|**Core Income Pre-Tax Return on Assets (D/E)**\*|**4.23%**|**5.19%**|**6.78%**|**5.40%**|
|Dormitory Borrowings (F)|453,165.00|469,210.00|426,502.00|449,625.67|
|**Core Income Pre-Tax Return   on Equity (D/(E-F))**|**9.81%**|**17.42%**|**17.95%**|**15.06%**|

*\* I have omitted corporate tax in this table due to uncertainties over the effective tax rate paid by CCL in Singapore on Worker Dormitories. Singapore’s standard corporate tax rate is 17%. CCL as a whole paid between 6.5%, 12.9%, and 23.8% of pre-tax income in corporate tax in 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

How do these numbers stack up? Comparing these to the ROA and ROE enjoyed by a comparable industry segment in the US, we see that CCL’s ROA and ROE of 5.4% and 15.06% fall roughly in line with the US accommodations sector, which enjoyed ROA and ROE of 6.4% and 16.3%.

**US Hotels, Rooming Houses, Camps, and Other Lodging Places ROA and ROE 2017 – 2019 (Source: Ready Ratios)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|

I’m not going to comment as to whether 5.4% ROA or 15% ROE pre-tax is a reasonable profit for a dormitory operator to make. However, I want to highlight the following – If we adjust the figures for 20% less occupancy, or the equivalent of converting all 10-man bunks into 8-man bunks, while maintaining the current level of amenities (e.g. frequency of maintenance, security systems), the ROA for last year falls from 4.23% to 2.42%.

While with sufficient political will it may be possible to strong-arm current dormitory operators to improve the living conditions of foreign workers living in dormitories without increasing their prices, the challenge comes in providing additional living spaces for the 20% of foreign workers who are now displaced from their old dorms. Would 2.42% pre-tax ROA be sufficient to entice new investors to build foreign worker dormitories?

How Profitable are Dormitory Operators Anyway? A Basic Analysis of Centurion Corporation's Financials,"Hi All,

Been seeing a lot of discussion lately about the dormitory operators and their supposedly exorbitant profits, so decided to take a deeper look at the annual reports of one of the larger players commonly mentioned, Centurion Corporation Limited (CCL), to take a look if this is indeed true.

**Tldr:**

* Profit margins are not a useful tool to evaluate CCL's profitability
* CCL's ROA and ROE of 5.40% and 15.06% are comparable to similar industries in the US
* If dormitory operators are to bear the full cost of reducing density of worker housing, ROA falls significantly to 2.42%

# Why Profit Margins are not a good indicator

When discussing the profitability of dormitory operators, a commonly statistic cited here is CCL’s profit margin of 72%. Looking at the financials, CCL did register an average gross profit ratio (GPR) of 71.10% and net profit ratio (NPR) of 58.46% over the last three years, with GPR of 72.69% and NPR of 77.83% in 2019.

**Centurion Corporation's Revenue & Profits (2017 - 2019) (S$'000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|133,353.00|120,070.00|137,113.00|130,178.67|
|Gross Profit|96,936.00|86,321.00|94,210.00|92,489.00|
|**Gross Profit Ratio**|**72.69%**|**71.89%**|**68.71%**|**71.10%**|
|Net Profit|103,788.00|84,151.00|37,644.00|75,194.33|
|**Net Profit Ratio**|**77.83%**|**70.08%**|**27.45%**|**58.46%**|

However, this statistic fails to consider CCL’s substantial business interests outside of dormitories, primarily in overseas student accommodation, which accounted for 25.5% to 34.3% of their revenue over the last three years. Pulling out the numbers for just the dormitories and adjusting for one-off items, we see that CCL has earned an average of S$38.3 million per year over the last three years, substantially lower than the average S$75.2 million net profit shown above.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory Income (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

*\* For the years 2017 – 2019, between 8.1% and 12.2% of Dormitory Revenue is attributable to Dormitories in Malaysia. However, as a further breakdown of the costs & assets by geography is unavailable, we will assume that the profitability of Malaysian dormitories is the same as those of Singaporean dormitories.*

*\*\* Earnings before Interest & Taxes*

*\*\*\* Core Income excludes one-off earnings/losses borne by the company, such as through sales/purchases of assets or fair value revaluation of assets. These were excluded due to their high volatility and lack of relevance to CCL’s core business. For reference, CCL registered $66.4 million, -$12.2 million and -$3.9 million in fair value gains/losses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

In addition, profit margins are not a useful indicator when evaluating the profitability of landlords like CCL, which are asset-heavy but incur minimal operating costs. As an analogy, if you rented out a room in your house for $1,000/month, and incurred additional utility fees of $100/month, would you consider it wildly profitable given profit margins of 90%? That is similar to evaluating CCL’s profitability based on their profit margin alone.

# Return on Assets

Instead of profit margins, a more suitable indicator to evaluate landlords would be the Return on Assets (ROA), which measures the profits earned by the company as a percentage of its total assets. Applying this ratio to CCL’s worker accommodation number, we get an average ROA of 5.40%, meaning for every $100 in assets the company owns, it gets approximately $5.40 back per year.

Given the high level of leverage employed by CCL, we can also go one step further and calculate their return on equity (ROE), which accounts for borrowings and averages out to 15.06%. To provide a rough analogy, this is the equivalent of buying a $1 million house, mortgaging it for $630,000 with the bank, and then earning $4,500/month in rental income.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory ROA and ROE (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|

|**Core Income Pre-Tax Return on Assets (D/E)**\*|**4.23%**|**5.19%**|**6.78%**|**5.40%**|
|Dormitory Borrowings (F)|453,165.00|469,210.00|426,502.00|449,625.67|
|**Core Income Pre-Tax Return   on Equity (D/(E-F))**|**9.81%**|**17.42%**|**17.95%**|**15.06%**|

*\* I have omitted corporate tax in this table due to uncertainties over the effective tax rate paid by CCL in Singapore on Worker Dormitories. Singapore’s standard corporate tax rate is 17%. CCL as a whole paid between 6.5%, 12.9%, and 23.8% of pre-tax income in corporate tax in 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

How do these numbers stack up? Comparing these to the ROA and ROE enjoyed by a comparable industry segment in the US, we see that CCL’s ROA and ROE of 5.4% and 15.06% fall roughly in line with the US accommodations sector, which enjoyed ROA and ROE of 6.4% and 16.3%.

**US Hotels, Rooming Houses, Camps, and Other Lodging Places ROA and ROE 2017 – 2019 (Source: Ready Ratios)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Return on Assets**|11.8%|4.1%|3.3%|**6.4%**|
|**Return on Equity**|34.0%|10.2%|5.7%|**16.3%**|

Closer to home, 99.co estimates that the average rental yield in Singapore is approximately 2.3% for residential properties (or $1,900 in our above example) and 3.3% for commercial properties (or $2,750 in our above example). While the returns from worker dormitories do seem significantly higher, they also enjoy considerably shorter leases, with most of CCL’s Singapore worker dormitories subject to leases of less than 30 years at the point of development.

# Other Possible Comments

>Profits don’t matter because the towkays are extracting their money through fat salaries instead

The three largest shareholders of CCL are Loh Kim Kang David, Hang Seng Juan, and Teo Peng Kwang, owning a total of 66.15%. While their combined salary of S$1,025,000 is significant, it ultimately represents only a small portion of CCL’s total costs.

There is of course a possibility that their children/wives/siblings/grandparents may be placed in other well-paid positions within CCL, allowing them to extract more money from it.

While with sufficient political will it may be possible to strong-arm current dormitory operators to improve the living conditions of foreign workers living in dormitories without increasing their prices, the challenge comes in providing additional living spaces for the 20% of foreign workers who are now displaced from their old dorms. Would 2.42% pre-tax ROA be sufficient to entice new investors to build foreign worker dormitories?

How Profitable are Dormitory Operators Anyway? A Basic Analysis of Centurion Corporation's Financials,"Hi All,

Been seeing a lot of discussion lately about the dormitory operators and their supposedly exorbitant profits, so decided to take a deeper look at the annual reports of one of the larger players commonly mentioned, Centurion Corporation Limited (CCL), to take a look if this is indeed true.

**Tldr:**

* Profit margins are not a useful tool to evaluate CCL's profitability
* CCL's ROA and ROE of 5.40% and 15.06% are comparable to similar industries in the US
* If dormitory operators are to bear the full cost of reducing density of worker housing, ROA falls significantly to 2.42%

# Why Profit Margins are not a good indicator

When discussing the profitability of dormitory operators, a commonly statistic cited here is CCL’s profit margin of 72%. Looking at the financials, CCL did register an average gross profit ratio (GPR) of 71.10% and net profit ratio (NPR) of 58.46% over the last three years, with GPR of 72.69% and NPR of 77.83% in 2019.

**Centurion Corporation's Revenue & Profits (2017 - 2019) (S$'000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Revenue|133,353.00|120,070.00|137,113.00|130,178.67|
|Gross Profit|96,936.00|86,321.00|94,210.00|92,489.00|
|**Gross Profit Ratio**|**72.69%**|**71.89%**|**68.71%**|**71.10%**|
|Net Profit|103,788.00|84,151.00|37,644.00|75,194.33|
|**Net Profit Ratio**|**77.83%**|**70.08%**|**27.45%**|**58.46%**|

However, this statistic fails to consider CCL’s substantial business interests outside of dormitories, primarily in overseas student accommodation, which accounted for 25.5% to 34.3% of their revenue over the last three years. Pulling out the numbers for just the dormitories and adjusting for one-off items, we see that CCL has earned an average of S$38.3 million per year over the last three years, substantially lower than the average S$75.2 million net profit shown above.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory Income (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

*\* For the years 2017 – 2019, between 8.1% and 12.2% of Dormitory Revenue is attributable to Dormitories in Malaysia. However, as a further breakdown of the costs & assets by geography is unavailable, we will assume that the profitability of Malaysian dormitories is the same as those of Singaporean dormitories.*

*\*\* Earnings before Interest & Taxes*

*\*\*\* Core Income excludes one-off earnings/losses borne by the company, such as through sales/purchases of assets or fair value revaluation of assets. These were excluded due to their high volatility and lack of relevance to CCL’s core business. For reference, CCL registered $66.4 million, -$12.2 million and -$3.9 million in fair value gains/losses in 2019, 2018 and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

In addition, profit margins are not a useful indicator when evaluating the profitability of landlords like CCL, which are asset-heavy but incur minimal operating costs. As an analogy, if you rented out a room in your house for $1,000/month, and incurred additional utility fees of $100/month, would you consider it wildly profitable given profit margins of 90%? That is similar to evaluating CCL’s profitability based on their profit margin alone.

# Return on Assets

Instead of profit margins, a more suitable indicator to evaluate landlords would be the Return on Assets (ROA), which measures the profits earned by the company as a percentage of its total assets. Applying this ratio to CCL’s worker accommodation number, we get an average ROA of 5.40%, meaning for every $100 in assets the company owns, it gets approximately $5.40 back per year.

Given the high level of leverage employed by CCL, we can also go one step further and calculate their return on equity (ROE), which accounts for borrowings and averages out to 15.06%. To provide a rough analogy, this is the equivalent of buying a $1 million house, mortgaging it for $630,000 with the bank, and then earning $4,500/month in rental income.

**Centurion Corporation Worker Dormitory ROA and ROE (2017 – 2019) (S$’000)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Dormitory Pre-Tax Core   Income (D)|33,673.00|34,665.00|46,437.00|38,258.33|

|Dormitory Borrowings (F)|453,165.00|469,210.00|426,502.00|449,625.67|
|**Core Income Pre-Tax Return   on Equity (D/(E-F))**|**9.81%**|**17.42%**|**17.95%**|**15.06%**|

*\* I have omitted corporate tax in this table due to uncertainties over the effective tax rate paid by CCL in Singapore on Worker Dormitories. Singapore’s standard corporate tax rate is 17%. CCL as a whole paid between 6.5%, 12.9%, and 23.8% of pre-tax income in corporate tax in 2019, 2018, and 2017 respectively.*

&#x200B;

How do these numbers stack up? Comparing these to the ROA and ROE enjoyed by a comparable industry segment in the US, we see that CCL’s ROA and ROE of 5.4% and 15.06% fall roughly in line with the US accommodations sector, which enjoyed ROA and ROE of 6.4% and 16.3%.

**US Hotels, Rooming Houses, Camps, and Other Lodging Places ROA and ROE 2017 – 2019 (Source: Ready Ratios)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Return on Assets**|11.8%|4.1%|3.3%|**6.4%**|
|**Return on Equity**|34.0%|10.2%|5.7%|**16.3%**|

Closer to home, 99.co estimates that the average rental yield in Singapore is approximately 2.3% for residential properties (or $1,900 in our above example) and 3.3% for commercial properties (or $2,750 in our above example). While the returns from worker dormitories do seem significantly higher, they also enjoy considerably shorter leases, with most of CCL’s Singapore worker dormitories subject to leases of less than 30 years at the point of development.

# Other Possible Comments

>Profits don’t matter because the towkays are extracting their money through fat salaries instead

The three largest shareholders of CCL are Loh Kim Kang David, Hang Seng Juan, and Teo Peng Kwang, owning a total of 66.15%. While their combined salary of S$1,025,000 is significant, it ultimately represents only a small portion of CCL’s total costs.

There is of course a possibility that their children/wives/siblings/grandparents may be placed in other well-paid positions within CCL, allowing them to extract more money from it. However, this information was not available in the annual reports, and thus far I have found no evidence to support this suspicion.

&#x200B;

>This analysis is flawed because it fails to take into consideration X, Y, Z factors.

This is possible, the above analysis is only based on the information contained in their 2019, 2018 and 2017 Annual Reports. There may be other relevant pieces of information, particularly surrounding the terms and purchase/development cost of their land, which were not considered.

If you have additional information which may be relevant, do comment below and I’d be happy to integrate it into the above analysis. Any feedback on how the analysis could be improved would also be appreciated. Ultimately, I hope for this to be a platform to discuss how Singapore as a society can best move forward with the worker dormitory situation.

# So What’s Next?

I’m not going to comment as to whether 5.4% ROA or 15% ROE pre-tax is a reasonable profit for a dormitory operator to make. However, I want to highlight the following – If we adjust the figures for 20% less occupancy, or the equivalent of converting all 10-man bunks into 8-man bunks, while maintaining the current level of amenities (e.g. frequency of maintenance, security systems), the ROA for last year falls from 4.23% to 2.42%.

Edit: Thanks for the gold kind Redditor!","Agree - but looking at his employment history - he left UOB Kay Hian as a Director in 2010. His position in Centurion Global was a non-executive director - the same position which he holds today. I can't find records, but I would be surprised if Centurion significantly decreased the pay for the same position from 2008 to present. In general, it also seems that [non-executive directors don't earn much](https://sbr.com.sg/financial-services/news/guess-how-much-non-executive-directors-in-singapore-are-paid-each-year), though this is a general statement rather than specific to this case.

The TOC link also calls out his wife, and if you google her, she's also independently wealthy (before she married Han). If I had to speculate: the Sentosa home was probably funded by earnings outside of Centurion Corp / Group, though of course, it is possible that the funds were indirectly obtained from Centurion Corp / Group.",2020-06-17 12:02:38

"Ytd I learnt that foreign workers aren't part of ""the community"" /s",,"When was the last time you mingled with one of those FWs or had an overnight chalet stay in their dorms? Probably never. Most locals never mingle with them. Let's call a spade a spade please: they have never been considered part of the community. I don't see why this fact should trigger anyone. Which is why even though for decades their living conditions have not been great, nothing has been done because no one cares enough about it. You probably didn't give a fuck. This is not some fantasy world where people living in a same country automatically become a single community filled with friendship and love and respect and rainbows.

But you miss the objective in splitting the data set. It's useful to segregate the data because a vast majority of the transmissions were within their dorms which you have never stepped a foot into your whole life. Among people you didn't care existed until recently. [Among already isolated clusters.](https://www.mom.gov.sg/covid-19/advisory-on-salary-payment-to-foreign-workers)

You then say, oh but they are free to go to my shopping malls and parks and what not. So rising transmission cases in FWs must then imply rising cases among the rest of the SG community right? But the data isn't showing that. There is no proportional spike. We had seen a proportional spike when thousands of people came back from overseas back to their families.

You will then say, oh but that's because they are testing FWs more and not testing locals enough. But that assumes that suddenly we are testing locals less, which is false. We have also had some of the highest per capita tests conducted even before the FW cases exploded. The extremely low death rates also suggests that the reported cases are a lot closer to the actual, so there is little evidence of the high undetected levels of community spread that fearmongers are postulating. But most of it should be contained with CB and mandatory mask wearing, and we should be seeing the effects over the next few days.",2020-04-18 18:55:36

The Govt logic is simple: if you discount these workers as members of the community, you can report low community transmission. Problem solved.

Now, given finite medical resources, how do we target the spread of covid? There is a need to evaluate groups with different risks (living environment, social norms) separately, and enforce various degrees of health measures based on different levels of risks. Why do we not count foreign workers as ""local community"" cases? They spend most of their time, guess where? The DORMS. Even if they head out, who do they hang with? Other foreign workers! Their level of infection risk is displayed differently from the average Singaporean, because IT IS.

And the Govt thinks reducing trains and having people 1 feet away in the train is “distancing”. Defend that too now!",2020-04-18 18:17:32

"Ytd I learnt that foreign workers aren't part of ""the community"" /s",,"Less revenue is your excuse to have people standing close in MRT? What’s the point of social distancing outside when running if you are going to have people cramped up in a train? That defeats the purpose. 

I am very concerned about the spread of virus. You seem to think because a place has been disinfected it can’t be infected again. I have news for you, any infected person touches the surface again when your disinfectant evaporates, can contaminate it! 

Buses and trains are ripe for it. Clusters get disinfected. Not every place an infected person has been. You can’t even trace every person you came into contact with, let alone every surface. Even in one city! You either think reality is a video game or we live in 2045. 

People are supposed to go out with masks. Most are, some are not. And wearing masks doesn’t mean you don’t touch surfaces or items in a supermarket. You don’t need to breathe in the virus. Touch is enough. Bring yourself up to speed.

By focusing on narratives to state foreign cases (all infected locally) are the problem because local cases are declining, the government is setting a bad expectation. One you have bought and refuse to budge from. You are entitled to believe what you want and see things your way. As I am. 

If you are unwilling to see obvious undertones in labeling workers staying in dorms as foreign cases separates from “local cases” whatever that means, you are part of the problem for me. So please suit yourself. You clearly lack understanding what news reporting does to people’s opinions, despite the fact that you are ample proof that the narrative is working, and you will argue endlessly to defend it.

"Ytd I learnt that foreign workers aren't part of ""the community"" /s",,"Once again, I do not agree because the new datasets created are not useful. 

Let's use another analogy. Let's say that we want to measure how many fruits are rotting in our warehouse. We have apples and grapes. We have 2 different boxes used to store them and one contains all grapes while others contain a mix of apples and grapes. 

One probable dataset would be AVERAGE ROT for both boxes. Also, AVERAGE ROT OF GRAPES and AVERAGE ROT OF APPLES can be used too. However, the second dataset has no significance since rot of apples and grapes are known to be the same rate, except the grapes have contact from both boxes. We know that grapes in the same box as apples are in the same population, hence it would be less ingenious to use AVERAGE ROT PER BOX as a dataset since we should only have 2 datasets in this scenario, one for each box. Creating one for apple in box 2, one for grapes in box 1, one for grapes in box 2 would not accurately present the P(ROT) for apples, nor the correct POSITIVE R value for apples since a second vector is missing. Please tell me otherwise.",2020-04-19 07:21:58

Wish the dashboard that MOH publishes has better slice/dice capabilities but folks such as yourself are a great help to provide this visualization. 


Just as a question, your data for 7 April shows between 50 and 100 for dorm and non dorm. Only choosing this day because it's the peak. However the covid report for 7th was

Please note that lately, when MOH announces cases at night, the count includes cases confirmed that day as well as ""overflow"" from the day before. Therefore, the numbers in this chart don't tally with the announced numbers, and the data for 10-Apr are incomplete as more cases will be added on today.

The testing/reporting system may be under strain as of the cases announced last night, only 50+ were from yesterday and the rest were from the day before.

**Cases that aren't related to foreign worker dorms and constructions sites seem to be on a downward trend since 7/4/20**; hope it stays that way. It was only 51 cases and I included some China/Myanmar/Thai cases that could turn out to be dorm/construction-related but aren't formally linked yet.

I did this using the data at [https://co.vid19.sg/singapore/cases/search](https://co.vid19.sg/singapore/cases/search) and ordering by local transmission and nationality. Classifying whether a case is likely linked to a foreign worker dorm or construction site is inexact.

"Updated: Rough breakdown of local COVID cases by worker dorm/construction-related vs ""general transmission"".

I think they only count those from the named dorm clusters into ""Dorm"". So those who are either linked to construction sites or who live in non-cluster dorms get categorized as ""Linked to Other Clusters"" or ""Pending Investigations"" respectively.

So the MOH situation report for 28-3 to 10-4 LTP holders has 545 linked to dorm clusters, 126 linked to other clusters, and 141 pending investigations. Whereas my estimate for the same time period is 702 dorm/construction-related.

The reason I make these graphs is that there are really 2 separate COVID problems in Singapore. Circuit Breaker can slow down the growth of the cases in the general public. But other than stopping work at construction sites, Circuit Breaker doesn't help the dorm/construction site problem. The dorm/construction site problem has to be tackled by improving the living conditions of these workers, testing them, separating the sick from the well. And conversely, issues of way too many people ""exercising"", eating at hawker centres, sneakily meeting up etc only affect the non-dorm problem. 

And yes, the testing situation is worrisome. I do not know how they are prioritizing the tests. And it would be political suicide for MOH to admit that they are either prioritizing SC/PR cases first (patriotism) or the dorm workers (because it is more urgent to separate the sick in cramped conditions).",2020-04-11 12:26:38

In March and earlier, there was still a decent chance that any Indian national could be an expat in some other industry. In April, sure, there could be a handful of Indian nationals that I mis-categorized, but there are vastly outnumbered by the dorm/construction workers.

[Not Real] Singapore Nationalist Party : Taking Care of the True Blue Singaporean,"We are not contesting this election(or any election in the future), but here are some key points of our manifesto if we did contest. The Singapore Nationalist Party pledges to always look out for the interests of the True Blue Singaporean.

Stances: Immigration and external affairs(see section on free trade agreements) we are right wing. Internal affairs we are left wing.

Topics in this ""manifesto"" include *Education, Car Ownership and Transport, Home Ownership, National Service, Voting Age, Universal Basic Income, Public Spending, Population Numbers, Jobs and Foreigners working in Singapore, Foreign Worker Dormitories, LGBTQ+, Foreign Interference in Local Affairs,* and *Data Transparency*. Searching using any of the above should take you directly to the topic you are interested in.

&#x200B;

* **Education**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will be guaranteed places in top and branded schools for Primary 1 registration, within their vicinity, or in vicinities nearby.
2. School branding will be taken away.
   1. We intend to make good on the ruling party's ""Every school is a good school"", which they have failed to attain as an ideal. We intend to use this initiative to bring up the standard of Singapore education as a whole.
   2. The campus will be absorbed into the purview of branded schools and become branches of branded schools.
   3. That would mean the consigning of non-branded schools and their histories to walls, rooms, or halls around the campus.
3. For polytechnic education, there will be a compulsory ""academic and presentation competencies"" course that all polytechnics students will have to go through to reduce the discrepancies in some ""basic skills"" between institutions.
4. For tertiary education, we will dismantle the private institutions, and have the campuses used by them put into the purview of the autonomous universities, just like non-branded schools in Primary and Secondary level.
   1. The admission into the autonomous universities will still follow the present system.
   2. Those that do not make the cut into the main campus can include the consideration of the branches in their university application.
   3. The rate for those in the branches will be subsidised, but the amount will be lesser than those for the main campus.
   4. An alternative option we will add into the system is applying to be re-admitted into the institution where they had their first A Level attempt regardless of the score being a failure grade, but there will also be an upper bound beyond which the student should just move on to university.
5. Trades do not seem to be getting the respect they deserve. Plumbing, woodcraft/carpeting, cooking, jobs that require competency and training, yet are not glamorous as they might not have a degree.
   1. We intend to make trade schools more attractive by incorporating these into higher education and to highlight how important these trades are to the functioning of Singapore.
   2. We will also establish trade unions that are not under the purview of any government organisation since it is the rights of workers plying these trades we are looking at.

&#x200B;

* **Car Ownership and Transport**

1. True Blue Singaporean households will be entitled to two electric cars at subsidised rates with zero or subsidised COE.
2. True Blue Singaporeans can opt for concession rates if they choose to take public transport.

&#x200B;

* **Home Ownership**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will be entitled to landed property, or highly subsidised housing in Housing Development Board projects.
   1. At their choosing, they can sell to others who are not True Blue Singaporeans at market rates.

&#x200B;

* **National Service**

1. We will require females to serve as well, possibly in healthcare organisations as trainee nurses.
   1. We recognise that with Singapore being an ageing society the healthcare sector will have additional stress.
   2. We hope to use this to raise the profile of nursing as a vocation, to train females in a practical skill, and to ensure that people behave less of an asshole around nurses.
2. For the males, True Blue Singaporeans can choose their vocation. They can also choose to serve after university studies if they manage to get a place in the year the A Level results are released.

&#x200B;

* **Voting Age**

1. Voting age should be 18.
   1. True Blue Singaporeans should be able to vote if they hold a gun.

&#x200B;

* **Universal Basic Income**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will get a surviving allowance.
   1. $200-$500 for students depending on the level of education they are at
   2. $1000 per month for working-age adults
   3. $1500 for senior citizens aged 65 and older.

&#x200B;

* **Public Spending**

1. We will relook infrastructure projects like Terminal 5.
2. We will ensure that the 1 billion dollar bin center does not happen again.
3. We also intend to right-size the country's budget such that some surpluses will still go into the reserves, but most will be used to fund initiatives that benefit True Blue Singaporeans.

&#x200B;

* **Population Numbers**

1. Unlike the ruling party who might or might not have toyed with a 10 million population(and who knows if there might have been larger numbers they might have considered playing with), we will never look at  a population of more than 6 million.
2. If we are using larger numbers for planning purposes, we will explicitly and categorically state that the number is used for planning
   1. The number used for planning is to ensure that there would not be train breakdowns as happened under the ruling party's watch in 2015.
3. We will also look into the proportion of True Blue Singaporeans to the overall population, along with foreign talent to overall population.

&#x200B;

* **Jobs and Foreigners working in Singapore**

1. We will advocate for amending the constitution to have a ""Hire Singaporeans First, Retrench Singaporeans Last"" law, and make it a rule that companies who want to set up shop here have to abide by.
2. We will look into the Free Trade Agreements signed by the ruling party.
   1. We do not want the other country to be ""outsourcing unemployment"" when it is their own fault for not controlling how many graduates(of possibly questionable quality).
3. For foreigners who want to work in Singapore, especially for white-collar jobs, they will have to agree to the condition that if they commit a crime, they will have their passes revoked and will be barred from working in Singapore ever again.
   1. Our rationale for this point is the Robertson Quay issue where a Foreign Talent posted on social media that a certain family have been here for more than 10 years and will not be allowed back into Singapore ever again, for the ""crime"" of going to get a drink and staying outside for longer than they should have.
   2. This is among other kinds of vetting we will ask the employers, and the Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority and the Ministry of Manpower to do when a foreign work pass is being sought.

&#x200B;

* **Foreign Worker Dormitories**

1. The ruling party were in denial of this being an issue until the pandemic happened.
2. We will look into the books of the firms owning the dormitories and get an explanation of why they have been profiteering from a potential health and safety hazard.
3. We will also be demanding that dormitory firms build their dorms to standards used by camps in the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Police Force, and Singapore Civil Defence Force.
4. While there will be some discomfort in possibly allowing these new dorms to be situated around residential estates, if not for these workers we might not even be having the apartments to stay in.
   1. This is a temporary measure while we get the construction and building industry to further automate and increase productivity so that we don't have to rely on them in the future.

&#x200B;

* **LGBTQ+**

1. We believe we should not be required to ask this question on why this group is not allowed into the mainstream(ie we do not believe that S377A should stay in the Constitution if it is ""not going to be enforced"").
2. Nonetheless, we will hold a referendum on the question of ""What makes the basic unit of Singaporean Society?"", with two choices.
   1. The first choice will be ""Only a heterosexual couple married with biological children is the basic unit of Singaporean society, all other groups are not"".
      1. The first choice has the implication of saying that married couple without children, married couples who have adopted, single parent families, and other groups who do not fulfill the traditional ""heterosexual couple married with biological children"" family definition do not deserve to participate in Singaporean Society.
   2. The second choice will be ""Besides the heterosexual couple married with biological children, there are other units and they should be allowed equal participation in Singaporean Society.
      1. The second choice allows groups that do not fulfill the traditional ""heterosexual couple married with biological children"" family definition to participate in Singaporean Society.

&#x200B;

* **Foreign Interference in Local Affairs**

1. We will also hold a referrendum on this contentious topic.
2. The two extreme choices will be ""All organisations and parties should be allowed to get a foreign entity to assist in issues affecting Singaporean Society"" and ""No organisation or party should be allowed to get a foreign entity to assist in issues affecting Singaporean Society"".
3. Compared to the other referrendum on the basic unit of Singaporean Society(see LGBTQ+ section), there would be more options besides the two extremes due to the option of having independent bodies audit the participation of foreign entities if allowed some degree of participation in affairs in Singapore.

&#x200B;

* **Data Transparency**

1. We will get the stat boards and ministries to release reports on statistics, including ones that do not look good on the ruling party
2. Reserves will also be part of this data, but we will not be expecting the cost of things like trees. Just the assets that are essential to the running of the country.
3. We will also be asking for the salary of the CEO of Temasek

2. For the males, True Blue Singaporeans can choose their vocation. They can also choose to serve after university studies if they manage to get a place in the year the A Level results are released.

&#x200B;

* **Voting Age**

1. Voting age should be 18.
   1. True Blue Singaporeans should be able to vote if they hold a gun.

&#x200B;

* **Universal Basic Income**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will get a surviving allowance.
   1. $200-$500 for students depending on the level of education they are at
   2. $1000 per month for working-age adults
   3. $1500 for senior citizens aged 65 and older.

&#x200B;

* **Public Spending**

1. We will relook infrastructure projects like Terminal 5.
2. We will ensure that the 1 billion dollar bin center does not happen again.
3. We also intend to right-size the country's budget such that some surpluses will still go into the reserves, but most will be used to fund initiatives that benefit True Blue Singaporeans.

&#x200B;

* **Population Numbers**

1. Unlike the ruling party who might or might not have toyed with a 10 million population(and who knows if there might have been larger numbers they might have considered playing with), we will never look at  a population of more than 6 million.
2. If we are using larger numbers for planning purposes, we will explicitly and categorically state that the number is used for planning
   1. The number used for planning is to ensure that there would not be train breakdowns as happened under the ruling party's watch in 2015.
3. We will also look into the proportion of True Blue Singaporeans to the overall population, along with foreign talent to overall population.

&#x200B;

* **Jobs and Foreigners working in Singapore**

1. We will advocate for amending the constitution to have a ""Hire Singaporeans First, Retrench Singaporeans Last"" law, and make it a rule that companies who want to set up shop here have to abide by.
2. We will look into the Free Trade Agreements signed by the ruling party.
   1. We do not want the other country to be ""outsourcing unemployment"" when it is their own fault for not controlling how many graduates(of possibly questionable quality).
3. For foreigners who want to work in Singapore, especially for white-collar jobs, they will have to agree to the condition that if they commit a crime, they will have their passes revoked and will be barred from working in Singapore ever again.
   1. Our rationale for this point is the Robertson Quay issue where a Foreign Talent posted on social media that a certain family have been here for more than 10 years and will not be allowed back into Singapore ever again, for the ""crime"" of going to get a drink and staying outside for longer than they should have.
   2. This is among other kinds of vetting we will ask the employers, and the Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority and the Ministry of Manpower to do when a foreign work pass is being sought.

&#x200B;

* **Foreign Worker Dormitories**

1. The ruling party were in denial of this being an issue until the pandemic happened.
2. We will look into the books of the firms owning the dormitories and get an explanation of why they have been profiteering from a potential health and safety hazard.
3. We will also be demanding that dormitory firms build their dorms to standards used by camps in the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Police Force, and Singapore Civil Defence Force.
4. While there will be some discomfort in possibly allowing these new dorms to be situated around residential estates, if not for these workers we might not even be having the apartments to stay in.
   1. This is a temporary measure while we get the construction and building industry to further automate and increase productivity so that we don't have to rely on them in the future.

&#x200B;

* **LGBTQ+**

1. We believe we should not be required to ask this question on why this group is not allowed into the mainstream(ie we do not believe that S377A should stay in the Constitution if it is ""not going to be enforced"").
2. Nonetheless, we will hold a referendum on the question of ""What makes the basic unit of Singaporean Society?"", with two choices.
   1. The first choice will be ""Only a heterosexual couple married with biological children is the basic unit of Singaporean society, all other groups are not"".
      1. The first choice has the implication of saying that married couple without children, married couples who have adopted, single parent families, and other groups who do not fulfill the traditional ""heterosexual couple married with biological children"" family definition do not deserve to participate in Singaporean Society.
   2. The second choice will be ""Besides the heterosexual couple married with biological children, there are other units and they should be allowed equal participation in Singaporean Society.
      1. The second choice allows groups that do not fulfill the traditional ""heterosexual couple married with biological children"" family definition to participate in Singaporean Society.

&#x200B;

* **Foreign Interference in Local Affairs**

1. We will also hold a referrendum on this contentious topic.
2. The two extreme choices will be ""All organisations and parties should be allowed to get a foreign entity to assist in issues affecting Singaporean Society"" and ""No organisation or party should be allowed to get a foreign entity to assist in issues affecting Singaporean Society"".
3. Compared to the other referrendum on the basic unit of Singaporean Society(see LGBTQ+ section), there would be more options besides the two extremes due to the option of having independent bodies audit the participation of foreign entities if allowed some degree of participation in affairs in Singapore.

&#x200B;

* **Data Transparency**

1. We will get the stat boards and ministries to release reports on statistics, including ones that do not look good on the ruling party
2. Reserves will also be part of this data, but we will not be expecting the cost of things like trees. Just the assets that are essential to the running of the country.
3. We will also be asking for the salary of the CEO of Temasek

[Not Real] Singapore Nationalist Party : Taking Care of the True Blue Singaporean,"We are not contesting this election(or any election in the future), but here are some key points of our manifesto if we did contest. The Singapore Nationalist Party pledges to always look out for the interests of the True Blue Singaporean.

Stances: Immigration and external affairs(see section on free trade agreements) we are right wing. Internal affairs we are left wing.

Topics in this ""manifesto"" include *Education, Car Ownership and Transport, Home Ownership, National Service, Voting Age, Universal Basic Income, Public Spending, Population Numbers, Jobs and Foreigners working in Singapore, Foreign Worker Dormitories, LGBTQ+, Foreign Interference in Local Affairs,* and *Data Transparency*. Searching using any of the above should take you directly to the topic you are interested in.

&#x200B;

* **Education**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will be guaranteed places in top and branded schools for Primary 1 registration, within their vicinity, or in vicinities nearby.
2. School branding will be taken away.
   1. We intend to make good on the ruling party's ""Every school is a good school"", which they have failed to attain as an ideal. We intend to use this initiative to bring up the standard of Singapore education as a whole.
   2. The campus will be absorbed into the purview of branded schools and become branches of branded schools.
   3. That would mean the consigning of non-branded schools and their histories to walls, rooms, or halls around the campus.
3. For polytechnic education, there will be a compulsory ""academic and presentation competencies"" course that all polytechnics students will have to go through to reduce the discrepancies in some ""basic skills"" between institutions.
4. For tertiary education, we will dismantle the private institutions, and have the campuses used by them put into the purview of the autonomous universities, just like non-branded schools in Primary and Secondary level.
   1. The admission into the autonomous universities will still follow the present system.
   2. Those that do not make the cut into the main campus can include the consideration of the branches in their university application.
   3. The rate for those in the branches will be subsidised, but the amount will be lesser than those for the main campus.
   4. An alternative option we will add into the system is applying to be re-admitted into the institution where they had their first A Level attempt regardless of the score being a failure grade, but there will also be an upper bound beyond which the student should just move on to university.
5. Trades do not seem to be getting the respect they deserve. Plumbing, woodcraft/carpeting, cooking, jobs that require competency and training, yet are not glamorous as they might not have a degree.
   1. We intend to make trade schools more attractive by incorporating these into higher education and to highlight how important these trades are to the functioning of Singapore.
   2. We will also establish trade unions that are not under the purview of any government organisation since it is the rights of workers plying these trades we are looking at.

&#x200B;

* **Car Ownership and Transport**

1. True Blue Singaporean households will be entitled to two electric cars at subsidised rates with zero or subsidised COE.
2. True Blue Singaporeans can opt for concession rates if they choose to take public transport.

&#x200B;

* **Home Ownership**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will be entitled to landed property, or highly subsidised housing in Housing Development Board projects.
   1. At their choosing, they can sell to others who are not True Blue Singaporeans at market rates.

&#x200B;

* **National Service**

1. We will require females to serve as well, possibly in healthcare organisations as trainee nurses.
   1. We recognise that with Singapore being an ageing society the healthcare sector will have additional stress.
   2. We hope to use this to raise the profile of nursing as a vocation, to train females in a practical skill, and to ensure that people behave less of an asshole around nurses.

Keep It Simple Stupid (KISS)

your point should always be simple and memorable.  pick one or two key policies that convey your message/theme. (e.g. build a wall, get brexit done). no point having such a long list if people forget what you say halfway through reading it.

1. Unlike the ruling party who might or might not have toyed with a 10 million population(and who knows if there might have been larger numbers they might have considered playing with), we will never look at  a population of more than 6 million.
2. If we are using larger numbers for planning purposes, we will explicitly and categorically state that the number is used for planning
   1. The number used for planning is to ensure that there would not be train breakdowns as happened under the ruling party's watch in 2015.
3. We will also look into the proportion of True Blue Singaporeans to the overall population, along with foreign talent to overall population.

&#x200B;

* **Jobs and Foreigners working in Singapore**

1. We will advocate for amending the constitution to have a ""Hire Singaporeans First, Retrench Singaporeans Last"" law, and make it a rule that companies who want to set up shop here have to abide by.
2. We will look into the Free Trade Agreements signed by the ruling party.
   1. We do not want the other country to be ""outsourcing unemployment"" when it is their own fault for not controlling how many graduates(of possibly questionable quality).
3. For foreigners who want to work in Singapore, especially for white-collar jobs, they will have to agree to the condition that if they commit a crime, they will have their passes revoked and will be barred from working in Singapore ever again.
   1. Our rationale for this point is the Robertson Quay issue where a Foreign Talent posted on social media that a certain family have been here for more than 10 years and will not be allowed back into Singapore ever again, for the ""crime"" of going to get a drink and staying outside for longer than they should have.
   2. This is among other kinds of vetting we will ask the employers, and the Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority and the Ministry of Manpower to do when a foreign work pass is being sought.

&#x200B;

* **Foreign Worker Dormitories**

1. The ruling party were in denial of this being an issue until the pandemic happened.
2. We will look into the books of the firms owning the dormitories and get an explanation of why they have been profiteering from a potential health and safety hazard.
3. We will also be demanding that dormitory firms build their dorms to standards used by camps in the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Police Force, and Singapore Civil Defence Force.
4. While there will be some discomfort in possibly allowing these new dorms to be situated around residential estates, if not for these workers we might not even be having the apartments to stay in.
   1. This is a temporary measure while we get the construction and building industry to further automate and increase productivity so that we don't have to rely on them in the future.

&#x200B;

* **LGBTQ+**

1. We believe we should not be required to ask this question on why this group is not allowed into the mainstream(ie we do not believe that S377A should stay in the Constitution if it is ""not going to be enforced"").
2. Nonetheless, we will hold a referendum on the question of ""What makes the basic unit of Singaporean Society?"", with two choices.
   1. The first choice will be ""Only a heterosexual couple married with biological children is the basic unit of Singaporean society, all other groups are not"".
      1. The first choice has the implication of saying that married couple without children, married couples who have adopted, single parent families, and other groups who do not fulfill the traditional ""heterosexual couple married with biological children"" family definition do not deserve to participate in Singaporean Society.
   2. The second choice will be ""Besides the heterosexual couple married with biological children, there are other units and they should be allowed equal participation in Singaporean Society.
      1. The second choice allows groups that do not fulfill the traditional ""heterosexual couple married with biological children"" family definition to participate in Singaporean Society.

&#x200B;

* **Foreign Interference in Local Affairs**

1. We will also hold a referrendum on this contentious topic.
2. The two extreme choices will be ""All organisations and parties should be allowed to get a foreign entity to assist in issues affecting Singaporean Society"" and ""No organisation or party should be allowed to get a foreign entity to assist in issues affecting Singaporean Society"".
3. Compared to the other referrendum on the basic unit of Singaporean Society(see LGBTQ+ section), there would be more options besides the two extremes due to the option of having independent bodies audit the participation of foreign entities if allowed some degree of participation in affairs in Singapore.

&#x200B;

* **Data Transparency**

1. We will get the stat boards and ministries to release reports on statistics, including ones that do not look good on the ruling party
2. Reserves will also be part of this data, but we will not be expecting the cost of things like trees. Just the assets that are essential to the running of the country.
3. We will also be asking for the salary of the CEO of Temasek

[Not Real] Singapore Nationalist Party : Taking Care of the True Blue Singaporean,"We are not contesting this election(or any election in the future), but here are some key points of our manifesto if we did contest. The Singapore Nationalist Party pledges to always look out for the interests of the True Blue Singaporean.

Stances: Immigration and external affairs(see section on free trade agreements) we are right wing. Internal affairs we are left wing.

Topics in this ""manifesto"" include *Education, Car Ownership and Transport, Home Ownership, National Service, Voting Age, Universal Basic Income, Public Spending, Population Numbers, Jobs and Foreigners working in Singapore, Foreign Worker Dormitories, LGBTQ+, Foreign Interference in Local Affairs,* and *Data Transparency*. Searching using any of the above should take you directly to the topic you are interested in.

&#x200B;

* **Education**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will be guaranteed places in top and branded schools for Primary 1 registration, within their vicinity, or in vicinities nearby.
2. School branding will be taken away.
   1. We intend to make good on the ruling party's ""Every school is a good school"", which they have failed to attain as an ideal. We intend to use this initiative to bring up the standard of Singapore education as a whole.
   2. The campus will be absorbed into the purview of branded schools and become branches of branded schools.
   3. That would mean the consigning of non-branded schools and their histories to walls, rooms, or halls around the campus.
3. For polytechnic education, there will be a compulsory ""academic and presentation competencies"" course that all polytechnics students will have to go through to reduce the discrepancies in some ""basic skills"" between institutions.
4. For tertiary education, we will dismantle the private institutions, and have the campuses used by them put into the purview of the autonomous universities, just like non-branded schools in Primary and Secondary level.
   1. The admission into the autonomous universities will still follow the present system.
   2. Those that do not make the cut into the main campus can include the consideration of the branches in their university application.
   3. The rate for those in the branches will be subsidised, but the amount will be lesser than those for the main campus.
   4. An alternative option we will add into the system is applying to be re-admitted into the institution where they had their first A Level attempt regardless of the score being a failure grade, but there will also be an upper bound beyond which the student should just move on to university.
5. Trades do not seem to be getting the respect they deserve. Plumbing, woodcraft/carpeting, cooking, jobs that require competency and training, yet are not glamorous as they might not have a degree.
   1. We intend to make trade schools more attractive by incorporating these into higher education and to highlight how important these trades are to the functioning of Singapore.
   2. We will also establish trade unions that are not under the purview of any government organisation since it is the rights of workers plying these trades we are looking at.

&#x200B;

* **Car Ownership and Transport**

1. True Blue Singaporean households will be entitled to two electric cars at subsidised rates with zero or subsidised COE.
2. True Blue Singaporeans can opt for concession rates if they choose to take public transport.

&#x200B;

* **Home Ownership**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will be entitled to landed property, or highly subsidised housing in Housing Development Board projects.
   1. At their choosing, they can sell to others who are not True Blue Singaporeans at market rates.

&#x200B;

* **National Service**

1. We will require females to serve as well, possibly in healthcare organisations as trainee nurses.
   1. We recognise that with Singapore being an ageing society the healthcare sector will have additional stress.
   2. We hope to use this to raise the profile of nursing as a vocation, to train females in a practical skill, and to ensure that people behave less of an asshole around nurses.
2. For the males, True Blue Singaporeans can choose their vocation. They can also choose to serve after university studies if they manage to get a place in the year the A Level results are released.

&#x200B;

* **Voting Age**

1. Voting age should be 18.
   1. True Blue Singaporeans should be able to vote if they hold a gun.

&#x200B;

* **Universal Basic Income**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will get a surviving allowance.
   1. $200-$500 for students depending on the level of education they are at
   2. $1000 per month for working-age adults
   3. $1500 for senior citizens aged 65 and older.

&#x200B;

* **Public Spending**

1. We will relook infrastructure projects like Terminal 5.
2. We will ensure that the 1 billion dollar bin center does not happen again.
3. We also intend to right-size the country's budget such that some surpluses will still go into the reserves, but most will be used to fund initiatives that benefit True Blue Singaporeans.

&#x200B;

* **Population Numbers**

1. Unlike the ruling party who might or might not have toyed with a 10 million population(and who knows if there might have been larger numbers they might have considered playing with), we will never look at  a population of more than 6 million.

3. We will also be demanding that dormitory firms build their dorms to standards used by camps in the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Police Force, and Singapore Civil Defence Force.
4. While there will be some discomfort in possibly allowing these new dorms to be situated around residential estates, if not for these workers we might not even be having the apartments to stay in.
   1. This is a temporary measure while we get the construction and building industry to further automate and increase productivity so that we don't have to rely on them in the future.

&#x200B;

* **LGBTQ+**

1. We believe we should not be required to ask this question on why this group is not allowed into the mainstream(ie we do not believe that S377A should stay in the Constitution if it is ""not going to be enforced"").
2. Nonetheless, we will hold a referendum on the question of ""What makes the basic unit of Singaporean Society?"", with two choices.
   1. The first choice will be ""Only a heterosexual couple married with biological children is the basic unit of Singaporean society, all other groups are not"".
      1. The first choice has the implication of saying that married couple without children, married couples who have adopted, single parent families, and other groups who do not fulfill the traditional ""heterosexual couple married with biological children"" family definition do not deserve to participate in Singaporean Society.
   2. The second choice will be ""Besides the heterosexual couple married with biological children, there are other units and they should be allowed equal participation in Singaporean Society.
      1. The second choice allows groups that do not fulfill the traditional ""heterosexual couple married with biological children"" family definition to participate in Singaporean Society.

&#x200B;

* **Foreign Interference in Local Affairs**

1. We will also hold a referrendum on this contentious topic.
2. The two extreme choices will be ""All organisations and parties should be allowed to get a foreign entity to assist in issues affecting Singaporean Society"" and ""No organisation or party should be allowed to get a foreign entity to assist in issues affecting Singaporean Society"".
3. Compared to the other referrendum on the basic unit of Singaporean Society(see LGBTQ+ section), there would be more options besides the two extremes due to the option of having independent bodies audit the participation of foreign entities if allowed some degree of participation in affairs in Singapore.

&#x200B;

* **Data Transparency**

1. We will get the stat boards and ministries to release reports on statistics, including ones that do not look good on the ruling party
2. Reserves will also be part of this data, but we will not be expecting the cost of things like trees. Just the assets that are essential to the running of the country.
3. We will also be asking for the salary of the CEO of Temasek

* ~~What is a True Blue Singaporean~~

1. ~~We will campaign to make people think that they will be considered True Blue Singaporeans, but in actuality we will come up with the most restrictive conditions~~.","1) how do you plan to avert the damage that your nativist policies will inflict on transnational families, ie. ""true blue"" singaporeans married to foreign spouses and ""true blue"" singaporean offspring of at least one foreign spouse? will singaporean spouses of prcs and indian nationals and filipinos + their singaporean kids not be disillusioned with their own country if one of their foreign parents constantly has to cop shit (""tiong"", ""cheena"", ""ceca"", ""pinoy"", ""foreign trash"") from the lowest common denominators because of the xenophobia that your manifesto will enable?

perhaps you should consider that hyper-neoliberal economic policies and the lack of proper worker protections in singapore are the real issues at hand - and that foreigners, despite being an easy target, are not responsible for the ills that we face?

2) how do you plan to renegotiate trade agreements with superpowers like china and india when singapore is a small fry with little manoeuvering room and a practically non-existent domestic market? how do you plan to account for the fact that FTA renegotiations are virtually unheard of? if the usa of all countries cannot renego the TPP, what sort of hubris are you filled with to genuinely believe that china and india will waste their time on a small fry like singapore and put our interests first over theirs?

they would sooner cancel the csfta and ceca and destroy our industries and small businesses in the process than give an inch.

you think it's so easy ah?

wait is this satire or foreal? because i'm having a hard time telling. can't be too sure these days.",2020-07-04 15:04:16
[Not Real] Singapore Nationalist Party : Taking Care of the True Blue Singaporean,"We are not contesting this election(or any election in the future), but here are some key points of our manifesto if we did contest. The Singapore Nationalist Party pledges to always look out for the interests of the True Blue Singaporean.

Stances: Immigration and external affairs(see section on free trade agreements) we are right wing. Internal affairs we are left wing.

Topics in this ""manifesto"" include *Education, Car Ownership and Transport, Home Ownership, National Service, Voting Age, Universal Basic Income, Public Spending, Population Numbers, Jobs and Foreigners working in Singapore, Foreign Worker Dormitories, LGBTQ+, Foreign Interference in Local Affairs,* and *Data Transparency*. Searching using any of the above should take you directly to the topic you are interested in.

&#x200B;

* **Education**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will be guaranteed places in top and branded schools for Primary 1 registration, within their vicinity, or in vicinities nearby.
2. School branding will be taken away.
   1. We intend to make good on the ruling party's ""Every school is a good school"", which they have failed to attain as an ideal. We intend to use this initiative to bring up the standard of Singapore education as a whole.
   2. The campus will be absorbed into the purview of branded schools and become branches of branded schools.
   3. That would mean the consigning of non-branded schools and their histories to walls, rooms, or halls around the campus.
3. For polytechnic education, there will be a compulsory ""academic and presentation competencies"" course that all polytechnics students will have to go through to reduce the discrepancies in some ""basic skills"" between institutions.
4. For tertiary education, we will dismantle the private institutions, and have the campuses used by them put into the purview of the autonomous universities, just like non-branded schools in Primary and Secondary level.
   1. The admission into the autonomous universities will still follow the present system.
   2. Those that do not make the cut into the main campus can include the consideration of the branches in their university application.
   3. The rate for those in the branches will be subsidised, but the amount will be lesser than those for the main campus.
   4. An alternative option we will add into the system is applying to be re-admitted into the institution where they had their first A Level attempt regardless of the score being a failure grade, but there will also be an upper bound beyond which the student should just move on to university.
5. Trades do not seem to be getting the respect they deserve. Plumbing, woodcraft/carpeting, cooking, jobs that require competency and training, yet are not glamorous as they might not have a degree.
   1. We intend to make trade schools more attractive by incorporating these into higher education and to highlight how important these trades are to the functioning of Singapore.
   2. We will also establish trade unions that are not under the purview of any government organisation since it is the rights of workers plying these trades we are looking at.

&#x200B;

* **Car Ownership and Transport**

1. True Blue Singaporean households will be entitled to two electric cars at subsidised rates with zero or subsidised COE.
2. True Blue Singaporeans can opt for concession rates if they choose to take public transport.

&#x200B;

* **Home Ownership**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will be entitled to landed property, or highly subsidised housing in Housing Development Board projects.
   1. At their choosing, they can sell to others who are not True Blue Singaporeans at market rates.

&#x200B;

* **National Service**

1. We will require females to serve as well, possibly in healthcare organisations as trainee nurses.
   1. We recognise that with Singapore being an ageing society the healthcare sector will have additional stress.
   2. We hope to use this to raise the profile of nursing as a vocation, to train females in a practical skill, and to ensure that people behave less of an asshole around nurses.
2. For the males, True Blue Singaporeans can choose their vocation. They can also choose to serve after university studies if they manage to get a place in the year the A Level results are released.

&#x200B;

* **Voting Age**

1. Voting age should be 18.
   1. True Blue Singaporeans should be able to vote if they hold a gun.

&#x200B;

* **Universal Basic Income**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will get a surviving allowance.
   1. $200-$500 for students depending on the level of education they are at
   2. $1000 per month for working-age adults
   3. $1500 for senior citizens aged 65 and older.

&#x200B;

* **Public Spending**

1. We will relook infrastructure projects like Terminal 5.
2. We will ensure that the 1 billion dollar bin center does not happen again.
3. We also intend to right-size the country's budget such that some surpluses will still go into the reserves, but most will be used to fund initiatives that benefit True Blue Singaporeans.

&#x200B;

* **Population Numbers**

1. Unlike the ruling party who might or might not have toyed with a 10 million population(and who knows if there might have been larger numbers they might have considered playing with), we will never look at  a population of more than 6 million.
2. If we are using larger numbers for planning purposes, we will explicitly and categorically state that the number is used for planning
   1. The number used for planning is to ensure that there would not be train breakdowns as happened under the ruling party's watch in 2015.
3. We will also look into the proportion of True Blue Singaporeans to the overall population, along with foreign talent to overall population.

&#x200B;

* **Jobs and Foreigners working in Singapore**

1. We will advocate for amending the constitution to have a ""Hire Singaporeans First, Retrench Singaporeans Last"" law, and make it a rule that companies who want to set up shop here have to abide by.
2. We will look into the Free Trade Agreements signed by the ruling party.
   1. We do not want the other country to be ""outsourcing unemployment"" when it is their own fault for not controlling how many graduates(of possibly questionable quality).
3. For foreigners who want to work in Singapore, especially for white-collar jobs, they will have to agree to the condition that if they commit a crime, they will have their passes revoked and will be barred from working in Singapore ever again.
   1. Our rationale for this point is the Robertson Quay issue where a Foreign Talent posted on social media that a certain family have been here for more than 10 years and will not be allowed back into Singapore ever again, for the ""crime"" of going to get a drink and staying outside for longer than they should have.
   2. This is among other kinds of vetting we will ask the employers, and the Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority and the Ministry of Manpower to do when a foreign work pass is being sought.

&#x200B;

* **Foreign Worker Dormitories**

1. The ruling party were in denial of this being an issue until the pandemic happened.
2. We will look into the books of the firms owning the dormitories and get an explanation of why they have been profiteering from a potential health and safety hazard.
3. We will also be demanding that dormitory firms build their dorms to standards used by camps in the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Police Force, and Singapore Civil Defence Force.

1. We believe we should not be required to ask this question on why this group is not allowed into the mainstream(ie we do not believe that S377A should stay in the Constitution if it is ""not going to be enforced"").
2. Nonetheless, we will hold a referendum on the question of ""What makes the basic unit of Singaporean Society?"", with two choices.
   1. The first choice will be ""Only a heterosexual couple married with biological children is the basic unit of Singaporean society, all other groups are not"".
      1. The first choice has the implication of saying that married couple without children, married couples who have adopted, single parent families, and other groups who do not fulfill the traditional ""heterosexual couple married with biological children"" family definition do not deserve to participate in Singaporean Society.
   2. The second choice will be ""Besides the heterosexual couple married with biological children, there are other units and they should be allowed equal participation in Singaporean Society.
      1. The second choice allows groups that do not fulfill the traditional ""heterosexual couple married with biological children"" family definition to participate in Singaporean Society.

&#x200B;

* **Foreign Interference in Local Affairs**

1. We will also hold a referrendum on this contentious topic.
2. The two extreme choices will be ""All organisations and parties should be allowed to get a foreign entity to assist in issues affecting Singaporean Society"" and ""No organisation or party should be allowed to get a foreign entity to assist in issues affecting Singaporean Society"".
3. Compared to the other referrendum on the basic unit of Singaporean Society(see LGBTQ+ section), there would be more options besides the two extremes due to the option of having independent bodies audit the participation of foreign entities if allowed some degree of participation in affairs in Singapore.

&#x200B;

* **Data Transparency**

1. We will get the stat boards and ministries to release reports on statistics, including ones that do not look good on the ruling party
2. Reserves will also be part of this data, but we will not be expecting the cost of things like trees. Just the assets that are essential to the running of the country.
3. We will also be asking for the salary of the CEO of Temasek

[Not Real] Singapore Nationalist Party : Taking Care of the True Blue Singaporean,"We are not contesting this election(or any election in the future), but here are some key points of our manifesto if we did contest. The Singapore Nationalist Party pledges to always look out for the interests of the True Blue Singaporean.

Stances: Immigration and external affairs(see section on free trade agreements) we are right wing. Internal affairs we are left wing.

Topics in this ""manifesto"" include *Education, Car Ownership and Transport, Home Ownership, National Service, Voting Age, Universal Basic Income, Public Spending, Population Numbers, Jobs and Foreigners working in Singapore, Foreign Worker Dormitories, LGBTQ+, Foreign Interference in Local Affairs,* and *Data Transparency*. Searching using any of the above should take you directly to the topic you are interested in.

&#x200B;

* **Education**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will be guaranteed places in top and branded schools for Primary 1 registration, within their vicinity, or in vicinities nearby.
2. School branding will be taken away.
   1. We intend to make good on the ruling party's ""Every school is a good school"", which they have failed to attain as an ideal. We intend to use this initiative to bring up the standard of Singapore education as a whole.
   2. The campus will be absorbed into the purview of branded schools and become branches of branded schools.
   3. That would mean the consigning of non-branded schools and their histories to walls, rooms, or halls around the campus.
3. For polytechnic education, there will be a compulsory ""academic and presentation competencies"" course that all polytechnics students will have to go through to reduce the discrepancies in some ""basic skills"" between institutions.
4. For tertiary education, we will dismantle the private institutions, and have the campuses used by them put into the purview of the autonomous universities, just like non-branded schools in Primary and Secondary level.
   1. The admission into the autonomous universities will still follow the present system.
   2. Those that do not make the cut into the main campus can include the consideration of the branches in their university application.
   3. The rate for those in the branches will be subsidised, but the amount will be lesser than those for the main campus.
   4. An alternative option we will add into the system is applying to be re-admitted into the institution where they had their first A Level attempt regardless of the score being a failure grade, but there will also be an upper bound beyond which the student should just move on to university.
5. Trades do not seem to be getting the respect they deserve. Plumbing, woodcraft/carpeting, cooking, jobs that require competency and training, yet are not glamorous as they might not have a degree.
   1. We intend to make trade schools more attractive by incorporating these into higher education and to highlight how important these trades are to the functioning of Singapore.
   2. We will also establish trade unions that are not under the purview of any government organisation since it is the rights of workers plying these trades we are looking at.

&#x200B;

* **Car Ownership and Transport**

1. True Blue Singaporean households will be entitled to two electric cars at subsidised rates with zero or subsidised COE.
2. True Blue Singaporeans can opt for concession rates if they choose to take public transport.

&#x200B;

* **Home Ownership**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will be entitled to landed property, or highly subsidised housing in Housing Development Board projects.
   1. At their choosing, they can sell to others who are not True Blue Singaporeans at market rates.

&#x200B;

* **National Service**

1. We will require females to serve as well, possibly in healthcare organisations as trainee nurses.
   1. We recognise that with Singapore being an ageing society the healthcare sector will have additional stress.
   2. We hope to use this to raise the profile of nursing as a vocation, to train females in a practical skill, and to ensure that people behave less of an asshole around nurses.
2. For the males, True Blue Singaporeans can choose their vocation. They can also choose to serve after university studies if they manage to get a place in the year the A Level results are released.

&#x200B;

* **Voting Age**

1. Voting age should be 18.
   1. True Blue Singaporeans should be able to vote if they hold a gun.

&#x200B;

* **Universal Basic Income**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will get a surviving allowance.
   1. $200-$500 for students depending on the level of education they are at
   2. $1000 per month for working-age adults
   3. $1500 for senior citizens aged 65 and older.

&#x200B;

* **Public Spending**

1. We will relook infrastructure projects like Terminal 5.
2. We will ensure that the 1 billion dollar bin center does not happen again.
3. We also intend to right-size the country's budget such that some surpluses will still go into the reserves, but most will be used to fund initiatives that benefit True Blue Singaporeans.

&#x200B;

* **Population Numbers**

1. Unlike the ruling party who might or might not have toyed with a 10 million population(and who knows if there might have been larger numbers they might have considered playing with), we will never look at  a population of more than 6 million.
2. If we are using larger numbers for planning purposes, we will explicitly and categorically state that the number is used for planning
   1. The number used for planning is to ensure that there would not be train breakdowns as happened under the ruling party's watch in 2015.
3. We will also look into the proportion of True Blue Singaporeans to the overall population, along with foreign talent to overall population.

&#x200B;

* **Jobs and Foreigners working in Singapore**

1. We will advocate for amending the constitution to have a ""Hire Singaporeans First, Retrench Singaporeans Last"" law, and make it a rule that companies who want to set up shop here have to abide by.
2. We will look into the Free Trade Agreements signed by the ruling party.
   1. We do not want the other country to be ""outsourcing unemployment"" when it is their own fault for not controlling how many graduates(of possibly questionable quality).
3. For foreigners who want to work in Singapore, especially for white-collar jobs, they will have to agree to the condition that if they commit a crime, they will have their passes revoked and will be barred from working in Singapore ever again.
   1. Our rationale for this point is the Robertson Quay issue where a Foreign Talent posted on social media that a certain family have been here for more than 10 years and will not be allowed back into Singapore ever again, for the ""crime"" of going to get a drink and staying outside for longer than they should have.
   2. This is among other kinds of vetting we will ask the employers, and the Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority and the Ministry of Manpower to do when a foreign work pass is being sought.

&#x200B;

* **Foreign Worker Dormitories**

1. The ruling party were in denial of this being an issue until the pandemic happened.
2. We will look into the books of the firms owning the dormitories and get an explanation of why they have been profiteering from a potential health and safety hazard.
3. We will also be demanding that dormitory firms build their dorms to standards used by camps in the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Police Force, and Singapore Civil Defence Force.
4. While there will be some discomfort in possibly allowing these new dorms to be situated around residential estates, if not for these workers we might not even be having the apartments to stay in.
   1. This is a temporary measure while we get the construction and building industry to further automate and increase productivity so that we don't have to rely on them in the future.

&#x200B;

* **LGBTQ+**

1. ~~We will campaign to make people think that they will be considered True Blue Singaporeans, but in actuality we will come up with the most restrictive conditions~~.",You must be fun at parties.,2020-07-04 19:55:40
[Not Real] Singapore Nationalist Party : Taking Care of the True Blue Singaporean,"We are not contesting this election(or any election in the future), but here are some key points of our manifesto if we did contest. The Singapore Nationalist Party pledges to always look out for the interests of the True Blue Singaporean.

Stances: Immigration and external affairs(see section on free trade agreements) we are right wing. Internal affairs we are left wing.

Topics in this ""manifesto"" include *Education, Car Ownership and Transport, Home Ownership, National Service, Voting Age, Universal Basic Income, Public Spending, Population Numbers, Jobs and Foreigners working in Singapore, Foreign Worker Dormitories, LGBTQ+, Foreign Interference in Local Affairs,* and *Data Transparency*. Searching using any of the above should take you directly to the topic you are interested in.

&#x200B;

* **Education**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will be guaranteed places in top and branded schools for Primary 1 registration, within their vicinity, or in vicinities nearby.
2. School branding will be taken away.
   1. We intend to make good on the ruling party's ""Every school is a good school"", which they have failed to attain as an ideal. We intend to use this initiative to bring up the standard of Singapore education as a whole.
   2. The campus will be absorbed into the purview of branded schools and become branches of branded schools.
   3. That would mean the consigning of non-branded schools and their histories to walls, rooms, or halls around the campus.
3. For polytechnic education, there will be a compulsory ""academic and presentation competencies"" course that all polytechnics students will have to go through to reduce the discrepancies in some ""basic skills"" between institutions.
4. For tertiary education, we will dismantle the private institutions, and have the campuses used by them put into the purview of the autonomous universities, just like non-branded schools in Primary and Secondary level.
   1. The admission into the autonomous universities will still follow the present system.
   2. Those that do not make the cut into the main campus can include the consideration of the branches in their university application.
   3. The rate for those in the branches will be subsidised, but the amount will be lesser than those for the main campus.
   4. An alternative option we will add into the system is applying to be re-admitted into the institution where they had their first A Level attempt regardless of the score being a failure grade, but there will also be an upper bound beyond which the student should just move on to university.
5. Trades do not seem to be getting the respect they deserve. Plumbing, woodcraft/carpeting, cooking, jobs that require competency and training, yet are not glamorous as they might not have a degree.
   1. We intend to make trade schools more attractive by incorporating these into higher education and to highlight how important these trades are to the functioning of Singapore.
   2. We will also establish trade unions that are not under the purview of any government organisation since it is the rights of workers plying these trades we are looking at.

&#x200B;

* **Car Ownership and Transport**

1. True Blue Singaporean households will be entitled to two electric cars at subsidised rates with zero or subsidised COE.
2. True Blue Singaporeans can opt for concession rates if they choose to take public transport.

&#x200B;

* **Home Ownership**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will be entitled to landed property, or highly subsidised housing in Housing Development Board projects.
   1. At their choosing, they can sell to others who are not True Blue Singaporeans at market rates.

&#x200B;

* **National Service**

1. We will require females to serve as well, possibly in healthcare organisations as trainee nurses.
   1. We recognise that with Singapore being an ageing society the healthcare sector will have additional stress.
   2. We hope to use this to raise the profile of nursing as a vocation, to train females in a practical skill, and to ensure that people behave less of an asshole around nurses.
2. For the males, True Blue Singaporeans can choose their vocation. They can also choose to serve after university studies if they manage to get a place in the year the A Level results are released.

&#x200B;

* **Voting Age**

1. Voting age should be 18.
   1. True Blue Singaporeans should be able to vote if they hold a gun.

&#x200B;

* **Universal Basic Income**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will get a surviving allowance.
   1. $200-$500 for students depending on the level of education they are at
   2. $1000 per month for working-age adults
   3. $1500 for senior citizens aged 65 and older.

&#x200B;

* **Public Spending**

1. We will relook infrastructure projects like Terminal 5.
2. We will ensure that the 1 billion dollar bin center does not happen again.
3. We also intend to right-size the country's budget such that some surpluses will still go into the reserves, but most will be used to fund initiatives that benefit True Blue Singaporeans.

&#x200B;

* **Population Numbers**

1. Unlike the ruling party who might or might not have toyed with a 10 million population(and who knows if there might have been larger numbers they might have considered playing with), we will never look at  a population of more than 6 million.
2. If we are using larger numbers for planning purposes, we will explicitly and categorically state that the number is used for planning
   1. The number used for planning is to ensure that there would not be train breakdowns as happened under the ruling party's watch in 2015.
3. We will also look into the proportion of True Blue Singaporeans to the overall population, along with foreign talent to overall population.

&#x200B;

* **Jobs and Foreigners working in Singapore**

1. We will advocate for amending the constitution to have a ""Hire Singaporeans First, Retrench Singaporeans Last"" law, and make it a rule that companies who want to set up shop here have to abide by.
2. We will look into the Free Trade Agreements signed by the ruling party.
   1. We do not want the other country to be ""outsourcing unemployment"" when it is their own fault for not controlling how many graduates(of possibly questionable quality).
3. For foreigners who want to work in Singapore, especially for white-collar jobs, they will have to agree to the condition that if they commit a crime, they will have their passes revoked and will be barred from working in Singapore ever again.
   1. Our rationale for this point is the Robertson Quay issue where a Foreign Talent posted on social media that a certain family have been here for more than 10 years and will not be allowed back into Singapore ever again, for the ""crime"" of going to get a drink and staying outside for longer than they should have.
   2. This is among other kinds of vetting we will ask the employers, and the Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority and the Ministry of Manpower to do when a foreign work pass is being sought.

&#x200B;

* **Foreign Worker Dormitories**

1. The ruling party were in denial of this being an issue until the pandemic happened.
2. We will look into the books of the firms owning the dormitories and get an explanation of why they have been profiteering from a potential health and safety hazard.
3. We will also be demanding that dormitory firms build their dorms to standards used by camps in the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Police Force, and Singapore Civil Defence Force.
4. While there will be some discomfort in possibly allowing these new dorms to be situated around residential estates, if not for these workers we might not even be having the apartments to stay in.
   1. This is a temporary measure while we get the construction and building industry to further automate and increase productivity so that we don't have to rely on them in the future.

&#x200B;

* **LGBTQ+**

1. We believe we should not be required to ask this question on why this group is not allowed into the mainstream(ie we do not believe that S377A should stay in the Constitution if it is ""not going to be enforced"").
2. Nonetheless, we will hold a referendum on the question of ""What makes the basic unit of Singaporean Society?"", with two choices.
   1. The first choice will be ""Only a heterosexual couple married with biological children is the basic unit of Singaporean society, all other groups are not"".
      1. The first choice has the implication of saying that married couple without children, married couples who have adopted, single parent families, and other groups who do not fulfill the traditional ""heterosexual couple married with biological children"" family definition do not deserve to participate in Singaporean Society.
   2. The second choice will be ""Besides the heterosexual couple married with biological children, there are other units and they should be allowed equal participation in Singaporean Society.
      1. The second choice allows groups that do not fulfill the traditional ""heterosexual couple married with biological children"" family definition to participate in Singaporean Society.

&#x200B;

* **Foreign Interference in Local Affairs**

1. We will also hold a referrendum on this contentious topic.
2. The two extreme choices will be ""All organisations and parties should be allowed to get a foreign entity to assist in issues affecting Singaporean Society"" and ""No organisation or party should be allowed to get a foreign entity to assist in issues affecting Singaporean Society"".
3. Compared to the other referrendum on the basic unit of Singaporean Society(see LGBTQ+ section), there would be more options besides the two extremes due to the option of having independent bodies audit the participation of foreign entities if allowed some degree of participation in affairs in Singapore.

&#x200B;

* **Data Transparency**

1. We will get the stat boards and ministries to release reports on statistics, including ones that do not look good on the ruling party
2. Reserves will also be part of this data, but we will not be expecting the cost of things like trees. Just the assets that are essential to the running of the country.
3. We will also be asking for the salary of the CEO of Temasek

   3. The rate for those in the branches will be subsidised, but the amount will be lesser than those for the main campus.
   4. An alternative option we will add into the system is applying to be re-admitted into the institution where they had their first A Level attempt regardless of the score being a failure grade, but there will also be an upper bound beyond which the student should just move on to university.
5. Trades do not seem to be getting the respect they deserve. Plumbing, woodcraft/carpeting, cooking, jobs that require competency and training, yet are not glamorous as they might not have a degree.
   1. We intend to make trade schools more attractive by incorporating these into higher education and to highlight how important these trades are to the functioning of Singapore.
   2. We will also establish trade unions that are not under the purview of any government organisation since it is the rights of workers plying these trades we are looking at.

&#x200B;

* **Car Ownership and Transport**

1. True Blue Singaporean households will be entitled to two electric cars at subsidised rates with zero or subsidised COE.
2. True Blue Singaporeans can opt for concession rates if they choose to take public transport.

&#x200B;

* **Home Ownership**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will be entitled to landed property, or highly subsidised housing in Housing Development Board projects.
   1. At their choosing, they can sell to others who are not True Blue Singaporeans at market rates.

&#x200B;

* **National Service**

1. We will require females to serve as well, possibly in healthcare organisations as trainee nurses.
   1. We recognise that with Singapore being an ageing society the healthcare sector will have additional stress.
   2. We hope to use this to raise the profile of nursing as a vocation, to train females in a practical skill, and to ensure that people behave less of an asshole around nurses.
2. For the males, True Blue Singaporeans can choose their vocation. They can also choose to serve after university studies if they manage to get a place in the year the A Level results are released.

&#x200B;

* **Voting Age**

1. Voting age should be 18.
   1. True Blue Singaporeans should be able to vote if they hold a gun.

&#x200B;

* **Universal Basic Income**

1. True Blue Singaporeans will get a surviving allowance.
   1. $200-$500 for students depending on the level of education they are at
   2. $1000 per month for working-age adults
   3. $1500 for senior citizens aged 65 and older.

&#x200B;

* **Public Spending**

1. We will relook infrastructure projects like Terminal 5.
2. We will ensure that the 1 billion dollar bin center does not happen again.
3. We also intend to right-size the country's budget such that some surpluses will still go into the reserves, but most will be used to fund initiatives that benefit True Blue Singaporeans.

&#x200B;

* **Population Numbers**

1. Unlike the ruling party who might or might not have toyed with a 10 million population(and who knows if there might have been larger numbers they might have considered playing with), we will never look at  a population of more than 6 million.
2. If we are using larger numbers for planning purposes, we will explicitly and categorically state that the number is used for planning
   1. The number used for planning is to ensure that there would not be train breakdowns as happened under the ruling party's watch in 2015.
3. We will also look into the proportion of True Blue Singaporeans to the overall population, along with foreign talent to overall population.

&#x200B;

* **Jobs and Foreigners working in Singapore**

1. We will advocate for amending the constitution to have a ""Hire Singaporeans First, Retrench Singaporeans Last"" law, and make it a rule that companies who want to set up shop here have to abide by.
2. We will look into the Free Trade Agreements signed by the ruling party.
   1. We do not want the other country to be ""outsourcing unemployment"" when it is their own fault for not controlling how many graduates(of possibly questionable quality).
3. For foreigners who want to work in Singapore, especially for white-collar jobs, they will have to agree to the condition that if they commit a crime, they will have their passes revoked and will be barred from working in Singapore ever again.
   1. Our rationale for this point is the Robertson Quay issue where a Foreign Talent posted on social media that a certain family have been here for more than 10 years and will not be allowed back into Singapore ever again, for the ""crime"" of going to get a drink and staying outside for longer than they should have.
   2. This is among other kinds of vetting we will ask the employers, and the Immigrations and Checkpoints Authority and the Ministry of Manpower to do when a foreign work pass is being sought.

&#x200B;

* **Foreign Worker Dormitories**

1. The ruling party were in denial of this being an issue until the pandemic happened.
2. We will look into the books of the firms owning the dormitories and get an explanation of why they have been profiteering from a potential health and safety hazard.
3. We will also be demanding that dormitory firms build their dorms to standards used by camps in the Singapore Armed Forces, Singapore Police Force, and Singapore Civil Defence Force.
4. While there will be some discomfort in possibly allowing these new dorms to be situated around residential estates, if not for these workers we might not even be having the apartments to stay in.
   1. This is a temporary measure while we get the construction and building industry to further automate and increase productivity so that we don't have to rely on them in the future.

&#x200B;

* **LGBTQ+**

1. We believe we should not be required to ask this question on why this group is not allowed into the mainstream(ie we do not believe that S377A should stay in the Constitution if it is ""not going to be enforced"").
2. Nonetheless, we will hold a referendum on the question of ""What makes the basic unit of Singaporean Society?"", with two choices.
   1. The first choice will be ""Only a heterosexual couple married with biological children is the basic unit of Singaporean society, all other groups are not"".
      1. The first choice has the implication of saying that married couple without children, married couples who have adopted, single parent families, and other groups who do not fulfill the traditional ""heterosexual couple married with biological children"" family definition do not deserve to participate in Singaporean Society.
   2. The second choice will be ""Besides the heterosexual couple married with biological children, there are other units and they should be allowed equal participation in Singaporean Society.
      1. The second choice allows groups that do not fulfill the traditional ""heterosexual couple married with biological children"" family definition to participate in Singaporean Society.

&#x200B;

* **Foreign Interference in Local Affairs**

1. We will also hold a referrendum on this contentious topic.
2. The two extreme choices will be ""All organisations and parties should be allowed to get a foreign entity to assist in issues affecting Singaporean Society"" and ""No organisation or party should be allowed to get a foreign entity to assist in issues affecting Singaporean Society"".
3. Compared to the other referrendum on the basic unit of Singaporean Society(see LGBTQ+ section), there would be more options besides the two extremes due to the option of having independent bodies audit the participation of foreign entities if allowed some degree of participation in affairs in Singapore.

&#x200B;

* **Data Transparency**

1. We will get the stat boards and ministries to release reports on statistics, including ones that do not look good on the ruling party
2. Reserves will also be part of this data, but we will not be expecting the cost of things like trees. Just the assets that are essential to the running of the country.
3. We will also be asking for the salary of the CEO of Temasek

COVID-19: 24 foreign workers permanently banned for violations of circuit breaker measures,,"> # COVID-19: 24 foreign workers permanently banned for violations of circuit breaker measures

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has revoked the work passes of 24 holders and permanently banned them from working in Singapore for flouting circuit breaker measures put in place to curb the spread of COVID-19.

> In a media release on Monday, MOM said it stepped up inspections at factory-converted dormitories to ensure that living conditions are acceptable, and that the well-being of the dorm residents are taken care of.

> MOM officers also checked that the dorm operators and employers adhere to the enhanced safe distancing measures. Among these measures are ensuring that employees stay in their rooms as much as possible, minimise interactions with those not living in the same room and leave the premises only if they need to purchase essential goods and services. 

> “Despite past enforcements carried out in the vicinity of Tuas View Square, our inspectors found 24 work pass holders eating, drinking, and gathering in groups. To send a clear signal of the seriousness of the offense, MOM has decided to revoke all 24 work passes and permanently barred the individuals from working in Singapore,” MOM said.

> At least 17 COVID-19 clusters linked to foreign worker dormitories have been identified thus far, including the largest cluster at S11 Dormitory@Punggol, which is linked to 365 cases.

> Eight such dorms have been gazetted as isolation areas, including the newly confirmed cluster at Acacia Lodge and Cochrane Lodge II.

> Between Saturday and Monday, MOM officers inspected over 600 dorms at Sungei Kadut, Tuas and other locations across Singapore. The vast majority of the dorms had instituted safe distancing measures and health checks for their residents. 

> Minor lapses were found in 57 dorms, with the most prevalent issue being a lack of sickbays and isolation areas. The cleanliness levels of some of these dorms were also found to be “unacceptable”, MOM said.

> MOM will complete the inspections of the remaining 600 dorms in the next two days. 

> Separately, MOM issued an additional advisory to employers of foreign workers living in the dorms, and other living arrangements on Monday to remind their employees to observe the safe distancing measures.

> Employers are reminded to continue to pay the salaries of their workers promptly and look after their well-being during the circuit breaker period. MOM said it will not hesitate to revoke the work pass privileges of errant employers.

MND has never revealed the cost of building flats in Singapore. 

Secondly, if you increase the pay for doing dirty work, employers will shift to more automation and technology. For example, the construction industry has been using more prefab technology in recent years. Hence, you may not see a proportionate increase in the labor component of building costs even if you double FW salaries. 

Thirdly, MOM collects a shitload of levy for foreign workers. Why can't this money be returned to the FWs in the form of higher pay? With higher pay, you can attract better skilled workers and improve productivity. Right now, foreign workers in the construction industry use Singapore as a stepping stone to better paying jobs in the middle east.

I recognise this is likely a troll post, but let’s address the issue head on while we are at it.

For one, labour costs don’t make up the entirety of the costs in a product. Paying workers more may result in the final product being more expensive, but it’s not going to double it. 

In cases where the employer clearly has the capacity to pay their employers more but chooses to pocket the extra earnings, there should be more social pressure to make them shell out more. Otherwise, this is just going to impose a negative externality on society. They save money feeding the foreign workers scraps which they use to fund their lifestyle and the taxpayer is the one who has to deal with the inevitable social fallout. 

While one can argue that these business owners are taxpayers as well, the money they save from cutting these corners is likely way more than what they contribute in terms of tax anyways. 

The problem is also a lot more deep-seated than this. If we are to pay employees more, other costs will need to be lowered. The next elephant in the room is clearly the ridiculous rates for rent that some tenants charge, just because they can. Yet nobody goes after them because the obvious retort is - “not happy with my rates then don’t rent loh”. 

Let’s face it - the current system is broken. You can’t just patch one problem here or there without expecting some kind of ripple effect.",2020-04-18 12:37:53

In exchange each foreign worker is provided housing by the government. The government then licenses dormitories based on minimum health and safety regulations. Then foreign workers are free to choose the dormitory they want. For each worker housed the government then pays out the $500 to the dormitory.
This way the boss does not save money by looking for the cheapest dormitory. The dormitory owner is not under pressure to cut corners, in fact they have every incentive to create better living conditions because each lodger results in a payout.

I think you are talking about S Pass and Employment Pass. Construction workers are here on work permits and there is no minimum salary.

>Is there a prescribed minimum wage for foreign workers in Singapore?
No.

>As a matter of national policy, MOM does not prescribe minimum wages for all workers in Singapore, whether local or foreign. Whether wages should increase or decrease is best determined by market demand and supply for labour.

>Employers should pay their employees (whether local or foreign), based on their skills, capabilities and competencies. A competitive pay structure can help a company motivate their staff, and retain valuable employees.

"Rough breakdown of local COVID cases by worker dorm/construction-related vs ""general transmission"". Please note that this is by confirmation date, not announcement date.

A lot of these cases are probably happening in foreign worker dorms and construction sites, relatively ""isolated"" from the general public, but MOH has not provided a breakdown.

I did this using the data at  [https://co.vid19.sg/singapore/cases/search](https://co.vid19.sg/singapore/cases/search)  and ordering by local transmission and nationality. Classifying whether a case is likely linked to a foreign worker dorm or construction site is inexact. Basically all Bangladeshi adult males are assumed to be dorm-related; I also classified all Indian (nationality) males confirmed after Mar-31 to be dorm-related. China nationals and Myanmar nationals were only classified as dorm-related if they were officially linked. Obviously there could be errors.

The spike at 7th April is horrifying. It is a sum of what was announced on 7th April, plus a lot of cases announced yesterday were actually attributed to the 7th. This way of announcing also means that a lot more cases confirmed yesterday could be added today; this is not a real dip.

**SALARY DAY, dir. R. Madhavan**

_Short film, made by a migrant worker_

This film is simple. It's about a migrant worker's salary day. He wakes up in a sparse dorm (not very crowded, thankfully), checks his POSB app on his phone to see monthly pay is in — 450. After he sees the sum, he pays about 300 to his family back home.

Then, he gets ready for the day and makes a point to show himself squeezing out every bit of toothpaste left. He first visits an Indian eatery, and pays a monthly food bill. Then, he buys some daily necessities, like toothpaste. There's his phone bill too, agency fees (more on that later), and then he has a hair cut. At the end of it, he just has one dollar left.

I hope I remember these details right. I checked with [this] (https://kopimotion.home.blog/2019/11/19/dignity-and-self-narration-in-alary-day-by-r-madhavan-2019/) site to verify some details, but not everything is there.

**I DREAM OF SINGAPORE, dir. Lei Yuan Bing**

This is the feature length one. I'll be brief.

It details the saga of this migrant worker, who got badly injured at work. His employer won't cover for him, so he goes to TWC2 for help. It's a charity/shelter place that helps these workers. They house him and deal with paperwork to send him home.

Home is a very rural village. Everyone welcomes him and it's revealed that everyone thinks Singapore is a great place to go, sort of like a place of absolution. You go there and get rich, get out of the slums. They treat the work as a privilege.

But of course, the guy reveals more. To get to Singapore, there are a few hurdles. First, you need training and qualifications. The training centre is a terrible, rundown place, and apparently they beat you with sticks. You also have to pay up front, and if you fail the test you pay again.

Afterwards, you pay to get to Singapore, travel costs and agency costs. Most people sell jewellery and other crap to cover, but it's not enough so they get a loan.

This is the kicker, because they'll never be able to pay the loan back.

I know details are scant, I don't even remember the guy's name, but I hope you can bear with me. It has been months and it was quite a terribly put together film. It had a great message but, yeah, I was switching off here and there.

**Q&A**

This Q&A had a migrant worker there. He's important, because he is one of the success stories. Not all migrant workers are blatantly abused. He's married and is going to have a kid.

Anyway, he tells the audience in the cinema more.

For example, the grass cutters (the shrouded guys with the apparatus that goes NNNNNNNNNNNGGGGG ) earn something like 5$ a day. It was not more than 10$, but I'm not sure if it was 5 or 7. Very specific numbers. But it's pittance. The garb combined with the heat is absolutely damaging.

He added that sometimes they don't have energy because of the scant food they eat. Remember [this] (https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/poor-nutrition-foreign-workers-catered-meals-study) piece of news?

The other part that I really remembered was that the government's laws are completely ineffectual.

Agencies/companies find ways to skirt, such as putting on paper that a worker earns the correct amount of money but then gets it back through ""fees"" or whatever.

Anyway, that's about all I remember. I do remember something about how companies get a grant for doing things right, but then pockets the grant for themselves, but that's too foggy to be written in stone.

You might be better off Googling around to see what you can dig up. There is some choice info on Facebook but I can't link because ominous sub-reddit rules.

Some things I learnt about migrant workers from two films I watched at the Projector.,"Because of the recent trend here, I thought I might cap off the talks with my experience watching a short film, a film, and participating in a Q&A afterwards. I've had to talk about it in parts in the comments, but I thought it deserved some airing out since the materials don't seem to be available anytime soon.

**SALARY DAY, dir. R. Madhavan**

_Short film, made by a migrant worker_

This film is simple. It's about a migrant worker's salary day. He wakes up in a sparse dorm (not very crowded, thankfully), checks his POSB app on his phone to see monthly pay is in — 450. After he sees the sum, he pays about 300 to his family back home.

Then, he gets ready for the day and makes a point to show himself squeezing out every bit of toothpaste left. He first visits an Indian eatery, and pays a monthly food bill. Then, he buys some daily necessities, like toothpaste. There's his phone bill too, agency fees (more on that later), and then he has a hair cut. At the end of it, he just has one dollar left.

I hope I remember these details right. I checked with [this] (https://kopimotion.home.blog/2019/11/19/dignity-and-self-narration-in-alary-day-by-r-madhavan-2019/) site to verify some details, but not everything is there.

**I DREAM OF SINGAPORE, dir. Lei Yuan Bing**

This is the feature length one. I'll be brief.

It details the saga of this migrant worker, who got badly injured at work. His employer won't cover for him, so he goes to TWC2 for help. It's a charity/shelter place that helps these workers. They house him and deal with paperwork to send him home.

Home is a very rural village. Everyone welcomes him and it's revealed that everyone thinks Singapore is a great place to go, sort of like a place of absolution. You go there and get rich, get out of the slums. They treat the work as a privilege.

But of course, the guy reveals more. To get to Singapore, there are a few hurdles. First, you need training and qualifications. The training centre is a terrible, rundown place, and apparently they beat you with sticks. You also have to pay up front, and if you fail the test you pay again.

Afterwards, you pay to get to Singapore, travel costs and agency costs. Most people sell jewellery and other crap to cover, but it's not enough so they get a loan.

This is the kicker, because they'll never be able to pay the loan back.

I know details are scant, I don't even remember the guy's name, but I hope you can bear with me. It has been months and it was quite a terribly put together film. It had a great message but, yeah, I was switching off here and there.

**Q&A**

This Q&A had a migrant worker there. He's important, because he is one of the success stories. Not all migrant workers are blatantly abused. He's married and is going to have a kid.

Anyway, he tells the audience in the cinema more.

For example, the grass cutters (the shrouded guys with the apparatus that goes NNNNNNNNNNNGGGGG ) earn something like 5$ a day. It was not more than 10$, but I'm not sure if it was 5 or 7. Very specific numbers. But it's pittance. The garb combined with the heat is absolutely damaging.

He added that sometimes they don't have energy because of the scant food they eat. Remember [this] (https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/poor-nutrition-foreign-workers-catered-meals-study) piece of news?

The other part that I really remembered was that the government's laws are completely ineffectual.

Agencies/companies find ways to skirt, such as putting on paper that a worker earns the correct amount of money but then gets it back through ""fees"" or whatever.

Anyway, that's about all I remember. I do remember something about how companies get a grant for doing things right, but then pockets the grant for themselves, but that's too foggy to be written in stone.

#Tl;dr: Migrant workers have a sucky life.","I'd take this with a ton of salt. Few reasons. 

It's rather easy to make SGD 300/month in India. It's \~INR 500 a day and typical pay for ad-hoc labour in the construction industry.

If a migrant makes the same or a little bit higher than the home country, the economic rationale of immigration doesn't make a lot of sense. In this specific case, there is little career progression so chances of future prospect are minimal.

Of course I do agree that conditions can be better and we should recognize their contributions, but if they can afford a good smart phone, have a side chick, buy beer 3-4 times a week and still decently enjoy life in spite of their job, I really believe they still have a good quality of life compared to other countries that use foreign labour.",2020-04-11 11:06:00

**SALARY DAY, dir. R. Madhavan**

_Short film, made by a migrant worker_

This film is simple. It's about a migrant worker's salary day. He wakes up in a sparse dorm (not very crowded, thankfully), checks his POSB app on his phone to see monthly pay is in — 450. After he sees the sum, he pays about 300 to his family back home.

Then, he gets ready for the day and makes a point to show himself squeezing out every bit of toothpaste left. He first visits an Indian eatery, and pays a monthly food bill. Then, he buys some daily necessities, like toothpaste. There's his phone bill too, agency fees (more on that later), and then he has a hair cut. At the end of it, he just has one dollar left.

I hope I remember these details right. I checked with [this] (https://kopimotion.home.blog/2019/11/19/dignity-and-self-narration-in-alary-day-by-r-madhavan-2019/) site to verify some details, but not everything is there.

**I DREAM OF SINGAPORE, dir. Lei Yuan Bing**

This is the feature length one. I'll be brief.

It details the saga of this migrant worker, who got badly injured at work. His employer won't cover for him, so he goes to TWC2 for help. It's a charity/shelter place that helps these workers. They house him and deal with paperwork to send him home.

Home is a very rural village. Everyone welcomes him and it's revealed that everyone thinks Singapore is a great place to go, sort of like a place of absolution. You go there and get rich, get out of the slums. They treat the work as a privilege.

But of course, the guy reveals more. To get to Singapore, there are a few hurdles. First, you need training and qualifications. The training centre is a terrible, rundown place, and apparently they beat you with sticks. You also have to pay up front, and if you fail the test you pay again.

Afterwards, you pay to get to Singapore, travel costs and agency costs. Most people sell jewellery and other crap to cover, but it's not enough so they get a loan.

This is the kicker, because they'll never be able to pay the loan back.

I know details are scant, I don't even remember the guy's name, but I hope you can bear with me. It has been months and it was quite a terribly put together film. It had a great message but, yeah, I was switching off here and there.

**Q&A**

This Q&A had a migrant worker there. He's important, because he is one of the success stories. Not all migrant workers are blatantly abused. He's married and is going to have a kid.

Anyway, he tells the audience in the cinema more.

For example, the grass cutters (the shrouded guys with the apparatus that goes NNNNNNNNNNNGGGGG ) earn something like 5$ a day. It was not more than 10$, but I'm not sure if it was 5 or 7. Very specific numbers. But it's pittance. The garb combined with the heat is absolutely damaging.

He added that sometimes they don't have energy because of the scant food they eat. Remember [this] (https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/poor-nutrition-foreign-workers-catered-meals-study) piece of news?

What Singapore should do for the foreign dormitory workers and current Covid situation,"**I write simply on the following premise:**  

* i. Worldwide trend of Covid infections has not reached its peak yet. Some countries do not have the capacity to implement measures for various reasons and the information received about them are unreliable.  
* ii. The likelihood of a ""second wave"" that could impact Singapore as measures are loosened, especially with regards to peoples' movement in and out of the country.  
* iii. The Singapore government is supporting the expenses of the foreign dorm workers that are currently not in any reasonable working capacity.  

**Based on the above, it is my opinion that:**  

* 1. There is a reliance on foreign dorm workers to build the infrastructure necessary for the effective handling of possible ""second wave"".  
* 2. If the foreign dorm workers are put to work and not handled properly, the risk of transmission amongst themselves increases and could lead to a domestic ""second wave"", resulting in greater societal impact of other sectors.  
* 3. Spending on foreign dorm workers is not sustainable long term if the workers are not put to work for good use.   

**Recommendation:**  
While I understand that there is a public demand to punish dormitory operators for their profit-maximising policies that led to the worsening of the current situation, this is something that would have to be postponed until after the situation is controlled.  

**The time-critical thing to do is:**  

* Separate the workers in batches, such that the healthy ones can be returned to work, in order to build the facilities and infrastructure required to handle ""second wave"".  
Each batch of workers, as much as possible, has to be isolated and have limited contact with non-essential staff.  
* Take control of the building of such facilities, especially the dormitories that will house the workers, to ensure they fulfill health guidelines criteria.  
* Let the public know that the foreign workers are essential at this time, and that now is not the time to enact punitive measures on private dormitory operators. Such measures will occur at a future date when the situation has stabilised.

**The time-critical thing to do is:**  

* Separate the workers in batches, such that the healthy ones can be returned to work, in order to build the facilities and infrastructure required to handle ""second wave"".  
Each batch of workers, as much as possible, has to be isolated and have limited contact with non-essential staff.  
* Take control of the building of such facilities, especially the dormitories that will house the workers, to ensure they fulfill health guidelines criteria.  
* Let the public know that the foreign workers are essential at this time, and that now is not the time to enact punitive measures on private dormitory operators. Such measures will occur at a future date when the situation has stabilised.  

Opinions are welcome.","these dorms are like prisons...minus the prison cells...you cant prevent these guys from mingling beyond a certain point.

you cant stop them from visiting little india too, beyond a certain point.

its very tricky to address this without attracting accusations of human cruelty.

Thats why the top guys are paid the big bucks...to figure this out so theres no recurrence when the workers get back into society. Else its back to square one.",2020-05-23 19:16:43
What Singapore should do for the foreign dormitory workers and current Covid situation,"**I write simply on the following premise:**  

* i. Worldwide trend of Covid infections has not reached its peak yet. Some countries do not have the capacity to implement measures for various reasons and the information received about them are unreliable.  
* ii. The likelihood of a ""second wave"" that could impact Singapore as measures are loosened, especially with regards to peoples' movement in and out of the country.  
* iii. The Singapore government is supporting the expenses of the foreign dorm workers that are currently not in any reasonable working capacity.  

**Based on the above, it is my opinion that:**  

* 1. There is a reliance on foreign dorm workers to build the infrastructure necessary for the effective handling of possible ""second wave"".  
* 2. If the foreign dorm workers are put to work and not handled properly, the risk of transmission amongst themselves increases and could lead to a domestic ""second wave"", resulting in greater societal impact of other sectors.  
* 3. Spending on foreign dorm workers is not sustainable long term if the workers are not put to work for good use.   

**Recommendation:**  
While I understand that there is a public demand to punish dormitory operators for their profit-maximising policies that led to the worsening of the current situation, this is something that would have to be postponed until after the situation is controlled.

How Singapore Rallied To Protect Its Migrant Community | One Of Us (CNA Insider documentary),"[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskXyTA7PDw&t=40s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jskXyTA7PDw&t=40s)

Apologies if this has been posted before as this came out last week.

Watched this very well made documentary last night. Shows how various organizations have come together to relieve the plight of our migrant workers (this label still irks me). I'm quite impressed at how ActiveSG staff helped to re-purpose sports facilities to house these workers. 

Also feel for the healthcare workers who volunteer their time after hours to help diagnose these foreign workers. You can see the exhaustion in their eyes, and yet they do it willingly because it is the right thing to do. They don't need cheering, they just need dorm operators to get their act together so that they don't have to go these additional lengths.

Almost seems like a deliberate attempt to diffuse and debunk the heavy criticism surrounding this crisis. Whatever the intentions, I do see these efforts as generally positive and hopefully this will change mindsets and pave the way for improvements in the future.",Own self created problem.
