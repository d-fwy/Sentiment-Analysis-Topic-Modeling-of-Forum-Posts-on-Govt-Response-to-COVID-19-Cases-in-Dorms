Quote:

		Why Singapore isnt in lockdown
Its pretty well-known that children are asymptomatic or only have mild disease, so there was no real reason to close schools. If you close schools, whats the trigger to reopen them?

In Singapore, we want life to go on as normal. We want businesses, churches, restaurants and schools to stay open. This is what success looks like. Everything goes forward with modifications as needed, and you keep doing this until theres a vaccine or a treatment.

On testing, the threshold for getting a test is pretty low. For the first week, we tested only people from Wuhan or Hubei province, then we tested anyone who had been in China within the last 14 days.

By the end of January, all of our public hospitals could do tests. Then we moved to enhanced screening  we tested anyone coming to a hospital with a respiratory illness, anyone who had been in contact with a COVID-19 patient.

Now, its even become more liberal. If youre a hospital staff member with a mild cold, well give you a test.

But if youre a normal person with no contacts with anybody and mild symptoms, wed just send them home. You can get a medical certificate that allows you to stay home from work for five days. If you are a casual worker, theres financial help with that, too.

"
If this is true why didnt MOH clearly mention this in Friday's report?  Now everyone is thinking the worst is over.

		Why Singapore isnt in lockdown
Its pretty well-known that children are asymptomatic or only have mild disease, so there was no real reason to close schools. If you close schools, whats the trigger to reopen them?

In Singapore, we want life to go on as normal. We want businesses, churches, restaurants and schools to stay open. This is what success looks like. Everything goes forward with modifications as needed, and you keep doing this until theres a vaccine or a treatment.

On testing, the threshold for getting a test is pretty low. For the first week, we tested only people from Wuhan or Hubei province, then we tested anyone who had been in China within the last 14 days.

By the end of January, all of our public hospitals could do tests. Then we moved to enhanced screening  we tested anyone coming to a hospital with a respiratory illness, anyone who had been in contact with a COVID-19 patient.

Now, its even become more liberal. If youre a hospital staff member with a mild cold, well give you a test.

But if youre a normal person with no contacts with anybody and mild symptoms, wed just send them home. You can get a medical certificate that allows you to stay home from work for five days. If you are a casual worker, theres financial help with that, too.

"
If this is true why didnt MOH clearly mention this in Friday's report?  Now everyone is thinking the worst is over.

		Why Singapore isnt in lockdown
Its pretty well-known that children are asymptomatic or only have mild disease, so there was no real reason to close schools. If you close schools, whats the trigger to reopen them?

In Singapore, we want life to go on as normal. We want businesses, churches, restaurants and schools to stay open. This is what success looks like. Everything goes forward with modifications as needed, and you keep doing this until theres a vaccine or a treatment.

On testing, the threshold for getting a test is pretty low. For the first week, we tested only people from Wuhan or Hubei province, then we tested anyone who had been in China within the last 14 days.

By the end of January, all of our public hospitals could do tests. Then we moved to enhanced screening  we tested anyone coming to a hospital with a respiratory illness, anyone who had been in contact with a COVID-19 patient.

Now, its even become more liberal. If youre a hospital staff member with a mild cold, well give you a test.

But if youre a normal person with no contacts with anybody and mild symptoms, wed just send them home. You can get a medical certificate that allows you to stay home from work for five days. If you are a casual worker, theres financial help with that, too.

"
If this is true why didnt MOH clearly mention this in Friday's report?  Now everyone is thinking the worst is over.

		Why Singapore isnt in lockdown
Its pretty well-known that children are asymptomatic or only have mild disease, so there was no real reason to close schools. If you close schools, whats the trigger to reopen them?

In Singapore, we want life to go on as normal. We want businesses, churches, restaurants and schools to stay open. This is what success looks like. Everything goes forward with modifications as needed, and you keep doing this until theres a vaccine or a treatment.

On testing, the threshold for getting a test is pretty low. For the first week, we tested only people from Wuhan or Hubei province, then we tested anyone who had been in China within the last 14 days.

By the end of January, all of our public hospitals could do tests. Then we moved to enhanced screening  we tested anyone coming to a hospital with a respiratory illness, anyone who had been in contact with a COVID-19 patient.

Now, its even become more liberal. If youre a hospital staff member with a mild cold, well give you a test.

But if youre a normal person with no contacts with anybody and mild symptoms, wed just send them home. You can get a medical certificate that allows you to stay home from work for five days. If you are a casual worker, theres financial help with that, too.

		Why Singapore isnt in lockdown
Its pretty well-known that children are asymptomatic or only have mild disease, so there was no real reason to close schools. If you close schools, whats the trigger to reopen them?

In Singapore, we want life to go on as normal. We want businesses, churches, restaurants and schools to stay open. This is what success looks like. Everything goes forward with modifications as needed, and you keep doing this until theres a vaccine or a treatment.

On testing, the threshold for getting a test is pretty low. For the first week, we tested only people from Wuhan or Hubei province, then we tested anyone who had been in China within the last 14 days.

By the end of January, all of our public hospitals could do tests. Then we moved to enhanced screening  we tested anyone coming to a hospital with a respiratory illness, anyone who had been in contact with a COVID-19 patient.

Now, its even become more liberal. If youre a hospital staff member with a mild cold, well give you a test.

But if youre a normal person with no contacts with anybody and mild symptoms, wed just send them home. You can get a medical certificate that allows you to stay home from work for five days. If you are a casual worker, theres financial help with that, too.

If this is true why didnt MOH clearly mention this in Friday's report?  Now everyone is thinking the worst is over.

...and you're also doing your own analysis from what you just wrote, so why can't others do theirs?"

		Need a lot of resources to do the Covid19 mass testing and timing.

What they are now doing is that if it ticks the various signs and symptoms of Covid19, it will be treated as one.
	
Will they be added to the number of confirmed cases?"
"basically those workers from dorms with respiratory symptoms are treated as covid automatically without testing or diagnosis, but will not be counted as covid

kind of weird don't you think? they're treated as covid pos, but on paper they're not covid pos

they should classify as suspected covid or pending diagnosis, rather than not covid"

		From the quote, as long the FW is from high infection rate dorm, if first check point diagnosis is respiratory disease, they consider as covid 19 liao, won't do the test kit.
	
As long as they count the number, it is ok

"I remembered when the numbers hit 1000 on Monday, the story is because we stepped up testing. Up to 3000 tests conducted daily. Thats why the spike. So now flip prata? Reduce testing ?"
