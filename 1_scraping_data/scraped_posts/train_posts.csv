There is no new cluster beside the dorm for two days..,2020-10-04 08:34:00,hardwarezone,no new cluster beside two days
">For consistency and accuracy, it could be easier to use data from the new MOH Situation Report which separates into Dorm, non-Dorm foreigners and Citizen/PR.

I think they only count those from the named dorm clusters into ""Dorm"". So those who are either linked to construction sites or who live in non-cluster dorms get categorized as ""Linked to Other Clusters"" or ""Pending Investigations"" respectively.

So the MOH situation report for 28-3 to 10-4 LTP holders has 545 linked to dorm clusters, 126 linked to other clusters, and 141 pending investigations. Whereas my estimate for the same time period is 702 dorm/construction-related.

The reason I make these graphs is that there are really 2 separate COVID problems in Singapore. Circuit Breaker can slow down the growth of the cases in the general public. But other than stopping work at construction sites, Circuit Breaker doesn't help the dorm/construction site problem. The dorm/construction site problem has to be tackled by improving the living conditions of these workers, testing them, separating the sick from the well. And conversely, issues of way too many people ""exercising"", eating at hawker centres, sneakily meeting up etc only affect the non-dorm problem. 

And yes, the testing situation is worrisome. I do not know how they are prioritizing the tests. And it would be political suicide for MOH to admit that they are either prioritizing SC/PR cases first (patriotism) or the dorm workers (because it is more urgent to separate the sick in cramped conditions).",2020-04-11 12:26:38,reddit,consistency accuracy could easier use data new moh situation report separates non foreigners citizen pr think count named clusters either linked construction sites live non cluster get categorized linked clusters pending investigations respectively moh situation report 28 3 10 4 ltp holders 545 linked clusters 126 linked clusters 141 pending investigations whereas estimate time period 702 construction related reason make graphs really 2 separate problems singapore circuit breaker slow growth general public stopping work construction sites circuit breaker doesn help construction site problem construction site problem tackled improving living conditions testing separating sick well conversely issues way many people exercising eating hawker centres sneakily meeting etc affect non problem yes testing situation worrisome not know prioritizing tests would political suicide moh admit either prioritizing sc pr first patriotism urgent separate sick cramped conditions

"I work nearby to the Westlite and Toh Guan Dorms. 

After the initial reports of Westlite having covid cases, I saw they were still open and operating as usual, even all the food stalls and the provision shop there. I was rather surprised they didn't try to isolate the situation earlier. 

I understand that maybe they couldn't just put everyone there under SHN immediately because of the financial implications, but I did wonder why they still allowed the workers to still congregate at the eating place and they also allowed the provision shop stay open. I didn't see any sanitizing stuff going on myself, but to be fair I have been telecommuting for most of the week so they may have done it without me seeing it.

Now after there are so many more cases, they decided to 'lock down' the place. And it also spread to Toh Guan Dormitory which is across the road and a couple units down.

I'm quite frustrated that something wasn't done earlier.",2020-04-06 20:55:47,reddit,work nearby westlite toh guan initial reports westlite saw still open operating usual even food stalls provision shop rather surprised didn try isolate situation earlier understand maybe couldn put everyone shn immediately financial implications wonder still allowed still congregate eating place also allowed provision shop stay open didn see sanitizing stuff going fair telecommuting week may done without seeing many decided lock place also spread toh guan across road couple units quite frustrated something wasn done earlier

"I feel that your views are quite myopic.

Have you seen how migrant workers are housed and transported? They're treated like  woodpile. Can you imagine the safety and hygiene standards in these dormitories? What about the trucks on which scores of workers are transported without seat belts and harnesses? It's obvious that the lives of these workers *matter less* than your average Singaporean person.

The western media looks at the Middle-east and Singapore with entirely different lenses (for pretty obvious reasons); that is precisely why we've been able to avoid the public eye. The sign of any developed economy is one where *unskilled* labourers (your welders, fitters and electricians) earn a good healthy income. For instance, a lolly-pop man in Australia can earn upto a 120k AUD (factor in a 30-40% tax on that; that's still a take home of about 70-80k); this is why these roles are taken up by Australians (and not folks from South Asia or China). On the flip side, your educated class wouldn't be earning wages that are too dissimilar either. In other words, the income gap is quite narrow and regulated. This is a tell-tale sign of a good, healthy, developed economy; and it's a far cry from what we see here in Singapore.",2020-05-02 18:41:32,reddit,feel views quite myopic seen housed transported treated like woodpile imagine safety hygiene standards trucks scores transported without seat belts harnesses obvious lives matter less average singaporean person western media looks middle east singapore entirely different lenses pretty obvious reasons precisely able avoid public eye sign developed economy one unskilled labourers welders fitters electricians earn good healthy income instance lolly pop man australia earn upto 120k aud factor 30 40 tax still take home 70 80k roles taken australians not folks south asia china flip side educated class wouldn earning wages dissimilar either words income gap quite narrow regulated tell tale sign good healthy developed economy far cry see singapore

"There are more than 40,000 Malaysians still in Singapore and the Malaysian state of Johor hopes that Singapore will make exemptions for them to be tested for Covid-19 before they are allowed to return to the state.More Malaysian workers are making their way back from Singapore after the Republic began implementing stricter measures to address the pandemic under a period known as the ""circuit breaker"". The measures which began on April 7 and will go on until May 4 have seen most workplaces and schools closed in order to reduce the risk of infections.Currently, Malaysians who test negative in Singapore will be able to go home and be quarantined there, while those without any certification or prior testing will be required to undergo compulsory 14-day quarantine at one of the government centres statewide.Johor Mentri Besar Hasni Mohammad said the state was working with the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the matter with their counterpart in Singapore given that the city-state presently does not conduct Covid-19 tests unless a person has showed symptoms.Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia Vanu Gopala Menon previously said there was currently no requirement by the Singapore government to provide random Covid-19 tests for foreign workers while Singapore's Ministry of Health has said that Covid-19 testing is only performed when clinically indicated, for patients and their close contacts.""That means a Malaysian can't get the test done in Singapore unless they are symptomatic, "" Datuk Hasni said in an interview in the Johor district of Iskandar Puteri.""We hope Singapore will allow for some exemptions so that Malaysians who want to return can get this test done at its clinics or hospitals, "" he said.Hasni said he was confident that the matter would be discussed through the Malaysia-Singapore Special Working Committee on Covid-19 for a solution to be reached.He said since Malaysia implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) on March 18 to curb the coronavirus, it has resolved certain issues, including easing the movement of cargo, essential and non-essential items between both countries as well as accommodation for Malaysian workers in Singapore.""The government will not stop Malaysians returning from Singapore and I can assure them that our frontliners have taken all the necessary steps and procedures at our border, "" he said.Hasni urged returning Malaysians to give their full cooperation to the frontliners conducting the necessary screening and testing at the checkpoints.On the number of Malaysians returning from Singapore after the island republic started its own measures to curb the spread of the virus, Hasni said the biggest influx was registered on April 3 with some 3,400 people. ""Since then there have been between 500 and 600 Malaysians coming back per day and we have been able to cope with the numbers, "" he added.-they-returnjust tell them all healthy and get them home to malaysia.",2020-04-13 09:56:00,hardwarezone,40 000 malaysians still singapore malaysian state johor hopes singapore make exemptions tested allowed return state malaysian making way back singapore republic began implementing stricter measures address pandemic period known circuit breaker measures began april 7 go may 4 seen workplaces schools closed order reduce risk infections currently malaysians test negative singapore able go home quarantined without certification prior testing required undergo compulsory 14 day quarantine one government centres statewide johor mentri besar hasni mohammad said state working malaysian ministry affairs discuss matter counterpart singapore given city state presently not conduct tests unless person showed symptoms singapore high commissioner malaysia vanu gopala menon previously said currently no requirement singapore government provide random tests singapore ministry health said testing performed clinically indicated patients close contacts means malaysian get test done singapore unless symptomatic datuk hasni said interview johor district iskandar puteri hope singapore allow exemptions malaysians want return get test done clinics hospitals said hasni said confident matter would discussed malaysia singapore special working committee solution reached said since malaysia implemented movement control order mco march 18 curb resolved certain issues including easing movement cargo essential non essential items countries well accommodation malaysian singapore government not stop malaysians returning singapore assure frontliners taken necessary steps procedures border said hasni urged returning malaysians give full cooperation frontliners conducting necessary screening testing checkpoints number malaysians returning singapore island republic started measures curb spread hasni said biggest influx registered april 3 3 400 people since 500 600 malaysians coming back per day able cope numbers added returnjust tell healthy get home malaysia

"It's not that the govt didn't take action until it was too late, they did, just not effectively in the dorms.

Additionally, policies from a previous epidemic can be used, and were used for the community and country, in preparation for the covid, but there was a sense of over-reliance on what was done for SARS, that some areas were overlooked. SARS didn't have widespread community transmission, but Covid-19 did.

So in this aspect, the government had to think of the possibilities in which the Covid-19 situation could get worse, and plan policies from there. But because at each escalation of the situation, things were changing quite fast, they didn't evaluate properly (or at least that's what we think) the consequences of each action.

The govt isn't wholly incompetent in the handling of epidemics, in fact, we did some necessary steps, such as the banning of flights, but the parts where they didn't, it was a case of wrong timing, and various other factors. 

For us to discuss the incompetence, we also have to realise the amount of available information at that point in time when they planned a policy. We must realise also that when we are discussing a past event, we already know the consequences of the policies. 

They did do quite a good job imo, outside the dormitories, with some errors that could have been prevented, but in relation to the dorms, it can be said that what could have been done probably wasn't to expectations.",2020-05-30 18:17:42,reddit,not govt didn take action late not effectively additionally policies previous epidemic used used community country preparation sense reliance done sars areas overlooked sars didn widespread community transmission aspect government think possibilities situation could get worse plan policies escalation situation things changing quite fast didn evaluate properly least think consequences action govt wholly incompetent handling epidemics fact necessary steps banning flights parts didn case wrong timing various factors us discuss incompetence also realise amount available information point time planned policy must realise also discussing past event already know consequences policies quite good job imo outside errors could prevented relation said could done probably wasn expectations

"Again, the covid problem has to do with hygiene, ability to social distance, and therefore applies only to errant dorm operators. It’s NOT a problem with race or nationality, which you appear to keep insinuating. At the moment, the government has released statements explaining how they will manage the quarantine of affected dorm communities. Are you saying that is not enough? If so, kindly explain why more and more money needs to go into this specific issue, and starving out other VWOs working on other social problems?

Second, I asked you a question. How is that creating a strawman? Are you implying you had the intention to create a misleading train of thought? Or are you trying to create a straw man for yourself now? If dorm operators following social distancing protocols, then each building and each storey should have been partitioned accordingly. That makes it practically no different from us living in our own HDB and only venturing out for necessities. So are you saying:

1) Dorm operators all ignore the rules?
2) The migrant workers are at fault for ignoring the rules?
3) You are privy to some other information that you are not reporting to assist the authorities?

Again, that final statement is a strawman. I’ve never disagreed the dorm issue isn’t worth government attention. I’ve said there’s a disproportionate amount of attention given to it, considering other issues present as well. If you have an issue with that, OR an opinion, then feel free to share in that context.

> I applaud Mr Cheng Shoong Tat for his letter (Why foot the bill for dorm operators that have profited for years?, May 16).

> He is correct to question why taxpayers should foot the bill to clear up a mess the dormitory operators have profited from.

> Singapore has always taken pride in being a beacon for global free enterprise. We are frequently reminded that our prosperity is based on a system of being open to business.

> We have argued that our system works because it does not mollycoddle people amid the realities of the free market.

> Our social assistance programmes are based on ""helping people to help themselves"".

> We help people to retrain and reskill when they lose their jobs, rather than support them financially when they are not working.

> Why should a society that takes pride in not sheltering people from the realities of the free market system find it acceptable to shelter large corporations from the same?

> The reality of the free market system is that it allows you to succeed with minimal government interference, but at the same time you are on your own if you fail.

> The dormitory operators are not innovative start-ups coming up with market-disrupting products that will shape the future. They are not enterprises that hire many Singaporeans in high-paying jobs.

> They make vast profits - Centurion Corp, for example, made $103.8 million on revenue of $133 million for the 12 months ended Dec 31 last year - merely by maximising the number of people in a certain space.

> If our system allows them to earn profits in this manner, should we not also allow them to bear the cost when the system requires them to adapt their businesses to new realities?

Especially now that they're in complete lockdown, for the sake and safety of Singaporeans.""Responding to Ong, Teo replied that she had not come across any migrant workers asking for an apology:""Ms. Anthea Ong asked about an apology. We interact very closely with the workers themselves, on a very regular basis at the dormitories, and even outside the dormitories whenever I'll ask teams, you know, follow up on their requests and feedback.I think what they’re focused on is how we can help them to handle this present situation, not fall sick, and if they fall sick, help take care of them, how to look after their wages being paid, how to ensure that they can send money home.These are the things that they have asked of us. I have not come across one single migrant worker himself that has demanded an apology.""Use her brain to think, who dares?? Doesn't take a genius to know right?

"Why would someone invest their money in a business that generates 10% profit margin instead of a business that generates 20% margin? 

Genuinely, would you invest in any sort of savings plan that gives less margin than another savings plan, all else being equal? 

You've not answered any of my questions on how this can be enforced when it comes to future constructions and developments. Yes the cost is distributed across society. How would the government enforce this cost? Increase levies and taxes against these construction and development companies? Create a price freeze that is pegged against some arbitrary or historical figure? On top of everything else, there are multiple parties involved. Dormitory owners, construction contractors, and property developers. If you force dormitory owners to absorb the cost of having more spacious lodgings and prohibit them from passing part or all of the additional cost to the construction contractor, then they will either take their money and go somewhere else, or convert their dormitories for more affluent clientele like foreign students, or pass on the cost to recruitment agents in the foreign worker's home countries, which are out of Singaporean jurisdiction. Or just charge the foreign workers more. The same sort of cycle will persist if you put the costs on the contractors, or the developers. 

If somehow these companies are able to be forced to absorb these costs and not pass them on to the consumer, then their P&L numbers go up, making them less attractive to investors, and the industry just doesn't grow. Without this growth, they will probably start cutting costs, beginning with poorer quality work or retrenchment of staff.

"Yes definitely the dorm operators are the ones at fault for not doing proper upkeep of the premises. But sadly, you know how it is here in Sg, they’re just gonna keep with the status quo until the Govt slaps them with a warning. Cos even if the migrant workers or advocates sound out to the dorm’s building management, nothing happens. Which is why most of those who voice out about this issue (as well as other issues relating to migrant workers) direct it towards the Govt.

It’s just like how at least 10 (or more) years ago, companies that employ just a small number of foreign workers used to rent an entire HDB unit for their workers, and such “dorms” were often overcrowded as well, until HDB set down the maximum occupancy for each unit (no matter 3/4 room or bigger) to be 6. 

Back then, most worker dorms around were built and managed by the employers, usually large companies that employ a lot of workers, such as SembCorp, Keppel shipyard, etc. Those dorms usually have more amenities & facilities and generally offer a better living environment (but still cannot compare to SAF bunks la).

"
Then you may be right for the first point but overall, it's meant to ensure the safety of other residents and not to treat them as ""prisoners"" living in a detention camp. Occupants working in different industries like construction or shipping may have access to tools that can pose a danger to other residents. And in a bid to prevent that, they might be checked when entering the facility.

Yes I have also met a worker who has stayed in Singapore for ten years. He's been here for so long because he's working to send all his daughters to medical school in India. He says that the pay back in his home country is not sufficient to do the same. My idea of temporary is that they are not staying here permanently. Workers also usually stay here for years because they are contracted by years and not months. After a period of time be it months or years they eventually leave. That is why I stated it as temporary even though they may have been residing in Singapore for quite some time.

Another point I want to make and I'm not siding on poor treatment of workers but workers have the option to choose their own housing facility albeit rare. Workers don't necessarily have to stay in dormitories, they have the option to rent HDB rooms but many choose not to because its more expensive. In addition, there are also different kinds of dormitories. Some dormitories are better than others but are also more expensive. Employers usually have a budget for housing and if workers instead choose a different housing option that is more expensive, they may be asked to top up the difference. Those that are reluctant have no choice but to stay in the dormitories that are assigned by their employers. This is the reason why I emphasise that workers should keep their quarters clean. If they do not wish to move to more sohphiscated dormitories that are more expensive, they should keep their current ones as clean as possible instead of letting it get filthy.",2020-04-08 12:12:14,reddit,may right first point overall meant ensure safety residents not treat prisoners living detention camp occupants working different industries like construction shipping may access tools pose danger residents bid prevent might checked entering facility yes also met stayed singapore ten years long working send daughters medical school india says pay back home country not sufficient idea temporary not staying permanently also usually stay years contracted years not months period time months years eventually leave stated temporary even though may residing singapore quite time another point want make not siding poor treatment option choose housing facility albeit rare necessarily stay option rent hdb rooms many choose not expensive addition also different kinds better others also expensive employers usually budget housing instead choose different housing option expensive may asked top difference reluctant no choice stay assigned employers reason emphasise should keep quarters clean not wish move sohphiscated expensive should keep current ones clean possible instead letting get filthy

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 548 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Sunday (24 May) noon, bringing the total to 31,616..

> Of them, the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories, said the ministry, while three cases are Singaporeans or permanent residents.

> It added that more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of over 2,500 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tuas View Dormitory and Jurong Penjuru Dormitory.

> They are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some 400,000 foreign workers live in dorms here in Singapore.

> Some 20,000 infected foreign workers are expected to be discharged by end-May, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong at a press conference last Tuesday.

> This story will be updated later.

> With 927more cases of COVID-19 infection discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities,  a total of 13,882 cases here have fully recovered from the infection, said the ministry on Friday.

"Basically, if FWs present respiratory pneumonia like symptoms, they would be deemed to have been clinically diagnosed to have COVID-19 and prolly treated symptomatically for it. But, as the news report on CNA had put it (on Saturday), this means that possibly hundred of such cases would have been left out because, being clinically diagnosed does not equal confirmed, hence these possibly infected cases would not be included in the daily tally of confirmed cases. It does not mean no more testing is done in the dorms, because if FWs have aforementioned symptoms of respiratory pneumonia, they are assumed to have COVID-19 and may be tested later as treatment comes first. I guess it's a way to simplify diagnosis and to assign treatment as priority, but it leaves out a large number of possible confirmed infections. Now, the issue whether this is done for expediency or outright masking the real number of infections per day, that's for you guys to decide.I doubt is deliberately hiding the number because you wouldn't see this news if they intend to do so.Since its on main stream means their approach are not well explained.",2020-04-26 12:37:00,hardwarezone,basically fws present respiratory pneumonia like symptoms would deemed clinically diagnosed prolly treated symptomatically news report cna put saturday means possibly hundred would left clinically diagnosed not equal confirmed hence possibly infected would not included daily tally confirmed not mean no testing done fws aforementioned symptoms respiratory pneumonia assumed may tested later treatment comes first guess way simplify diagnosis assign treatment priority leaves large number possible confirmed infections issue whether done expediency outright masking real number infections per day guys decide doubt deliberately hiding number wouldn see news intend since main stream means approach not well explained

"Most likely its also because its a highly regulated industry (at least at the planning stage maybe not so much on enforcement).

>"" this would require the authorities to review current building guidelines for dorms, such as increasing the gross plot ratio, which limits, among other things, building heights. ""

Meaning that there seems to only be certain designated plots of lands of specific sizes and in specific areas that are allowed for dormitories, no doubt due to our government's extreme focus on city planning. It also seems that there is quite limited land area currently allowed for these types of buildings, perhaps the government not wanting to give up too much land space for 'temporary' workers.

>""Current dorms typically have lease terms of between nine and 30 years.""

Makes sense that why would any developer want to spend the capital to build these  nicer and more spacious dormitories when the land goes back to the government in 10 years. Hence the unwillingness to go beyond the bare minimum.

In any case the dorms were built to current government regulations, albeit at the minimum requirements. This is the area which should have the most focus for change along of course with enforcement.

I don't think you can expect private businesses to do anything more than the legal minimum as there will always be a race to the bottom for an industry as competitive as this.

"SINGAPORE  The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (April 9) announced 287 new cases of Covid-19 in Singapore, with many of the cases traced to Mustafa Centre in Little India.Among the new cases, 219 are linked to foreign worker dormitory clusters containing workers who had visited the mall. Another 19 are linked to other known clusters and three are imported.The latest daily tally marks a new record, and is more than double the highest daily spike of 142 cases seen on Wednesday. This brings the total number of confirmed cases here to 1,910.National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-disciplinary taskforce tackling the coronavirus, said at a media briefing on Thursday that Singapore needs a major and urgent intervention to fight the spread of Covid-19 among the foreign worker population.ADVERTISEMENTHe noted that the taskforce requires a dedicated strategy for foreign workers due to the higher rate of transmission among them, and said it had enlisted the help of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and Singapore Police Force (SPF).The SAF and SPF will form part of a separate inter-agency taskforce, he said.Mr Wong added that the taskforce had also invited Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean to guide it in this strategy, given his familiarity with police work. Mr Teo had previously been Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Defence.As of Wednesday, six people had died from complications due to Covid-19 infection.Speaking on Thursday at the virtual media briefing on the latest cases, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, MOHs director of medical services, said preliminary links have been established between the clusters at Mustafa Centre, a 51-storey mixed-use construction site called Project Glory at Market Street in the central business district and five dormitories  Tampines Dormitory, S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, Toh Guan Dormitory, Sungei Tengah Lodge and Cochrane Lodge II.Many of these cases, in fact, started out in the cluster at Mustafa, said Assoc Prof Mak.He added that MOH is now testing foreign workers for Covid-19, as many cases who tested positive were workers who had very mild symptoms and were well.Mr Wong said that it is important for Singapore to realise that it is dealing with two separate infections  one in the foreign worker dormitories and one among the local population, where numbers are more stable for now, he added.We have had foreign worker cases before, including cases in dormitories. But this time, it is different, because there are many more venues outside of dorms, like Mustafa Centre and the Project Glory (construction site), where foreign workers had gathered and worked together, and the virus spread among them, he said.And when they went back to the dorms, they transmitted it to fellow dorm residents. So it is very likely that the virus spread has been going around for some time in dorms and we are now seeing the indications of it.That is why Singapore needs a dedicated strategy for foreign workers, Mr Wong added.There is a higher transmission rate among them, due to the high number of workers in close quarters.The strategy will firstly involve the effective management of all dormitories, which means taking care of foreign workers basic needs and well-being, taking into account factors such as cleanliness and food, and ensuring that safe-distancing measures are fully complied with, Mr Wong said.Secondly, MOH has deployed medical posts, first at critical dormitories and then at other foreign worker lodgings, for active testing.To do all of this well, Singapore will need to reduce the number of workers in each dormitory, Mr Wong added.So we are moving them out, those who are not sick, and accommodating them.Singapore Armed Forces military camps, the Changi Exhibition Centre, floating hotels usually used for offshore accommodation and a few vacant Housing and Development Board blocks are among the properties that have been requisitioned for this purpose.Essentially we are sparing no effort, Mr Wong said. We have a responsibility to these foreign workers who come all the way here at considerable expense.Despite our best efforts, all of us will have to be mentally prepared for the number of cases in dorms to rise But we do have comprehensive measures in place, he added.Read more at ",2020-09-04 20:28:00,hardwarezone,singapore ministry health moh thursday april 9 announced 287 new singapore many traced mustafa centre little india among new 219 linked clusters containing visited mall another linked known clusters three imported latest daily tally marks new record double highest daily spike 142 seen wednesday brings total number confirmed 1 910 national development minister lawrence wong co chairs multi disciplinary taskforce tackling said media briefing thursday singapore needs major urgent intervention fight spread among population advertisementhe noted taskforce requires dedicated strategy due higher rate transmission among said enlisted help singapore armed forces saf singapore police force spf saf spf form part separate inter agency taskforce said mr wong added taskforce also invited senior minister teo chee hean guide strategy given familiarity police work mr teo previously minister home affairs minister defence wednesday six people died complications due infection speaking thursday virtual media briefing latest associate professor kenneth mak moh director medical services said preliminary links established clusters mustafa centre 51 storey mixed use construction site called project glory market street central business district five tampines s11 punggol toh guan sungei tengah lodge cochrane lodge ii many fact started cluster mustafa said assoc prof mak added moh testing many tested positive mild symptoms well mr wong said important singapore realise dealing two separate infections one one among local population numbers stable added including time different many venues outside like mustafa centre project glory construction site gathered worked together spread among said went back transmitted fellow residents likely spread going around time seeing indications singapore needs dedicated strategy mr wong added higher transmission rate among due high number close quarters strategy firstly involve effective management means taking care basic needs well taking account factors cleanliness food ensuring safe distancing measures fully complied mr wong said secondly moh deployed medical posts first critical lodgings active testing well singapore need reduce number mr wong added moving not sick accommodating singapore armed forces military camps changi exhibition centre floating hotels usually used offshore accommodation vacant housing development board blocks among properties requisitioned purpose essentially sparing no effort mr wong said responsibility come way considerable expense despite best efforts us mentally prepared number rise comprehensive measures place added read

"Yeah, looks like community cases are stable at a few dozen over the last two weeks. 

I am wondering if the aggressive testing in the dorms are uncovering mild cases that would have otherwise gone undetected. 

For instance, in New York City, 13.5% of pregnant women going into L&D are found to be COVID+ [reference] because they are testing everyone admitted for labor and delivery at the hospital, regardless of whether they have symptoms. If this is anywhere near a representative sample, this implies ~1 million active cases in New York City, compared to 111,424 confirmed cases.

Given that MOH is said to be testing everyone in the dorms in a similar fashion, regardless of symptoms, we might be seeing the same thing play out.

"-12649472Since Jan 23, when the first case of coronavirus was reported here, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has advised dormitory operators to put in place preventive measures against COVID-19.Manpower Minister Josephine Teo recounted some of these measures on Tuesday, saying that they had reached out to dormitory operators to be more vigilant. ""Materials were produced in the workers’ native languages to encourage them to also take steps to protect themselves,"" she said. ""Subsequently, non-essential facilities like gyms and TV-rooms were closed. Mealtimes and recreational hours were staggered. Intermixing between blocks was stopped.""Gan KY & JoTeo likely have more than 10 years of work experience as Ministers. Base on this high level ground, I expect BETTER Results.1) MOM can advise anything. But they themselves know and are very clear, that many companies will not follow.For example: Maternity Leave started with many Companies forcing women to resign or use their annua leave to offset. Didnt Gan KY learn?It is obvious that LHL's musical chair Game is a FAILURE. It is not career rotation but accountability scrubbing.2) JoTeo can reach out 100 times, so what? I am very sure she knows that 75% of the people here are foreigners. They are fully aware of PA P's FOREIGNER  #1` POLICY. 3) Materials were produced in whatever languages means that MOM is not sincere in tackling this issue.WHO will be bothered to read?

"Once again, I do not agree because the new datasets created are not useful. 

Let's use another analogy. Let's say that we want to measure how many fruits are rotting in our warehouse. We have apples and grapes. We have 2 different boxes used to store them and one contains all grapes while others contain a mix of apples and grapes. 

One probable dataset would be AVERAGE ROT for both boxes. Also, AVERAGE ROT OF GRAPES and AVERAGE ROT OF APPLES can be used too. However, the second dataset has no significance since rot of apples and grapes are known to be the same rate, except the grapes have contact from both boxes. We know that grapes in the same box as apples are in the same population, hence it would be less ingenious to use AVERAGE ROT PER BOX as a dataset since we should only have 2 datasets in this scenario, one for each box. Creating one for apple in box 2, one for grapes in box 1, one for grapes in box 2 would not accurately present the P(ROT) for apples, nor the correct POSITIVE R value for apples since a second vector is missing.

"I truly believe this is a cumulation of public infrastructure bidding practices, demand for lower cost projects by all parties, high land cost, and lack of innovation in the construction industry both in Singapore and as a whole.

The government is the biggest developer in singapore due to infrastructural contracts. They also run project awards on a lowest bidder wins structure. Some news reports here: [-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116](-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116)

There are attempts to resolve this tho. But the underlying bidding structure is still lowest bidder wins. [-to-place-greater-emphasis-on-quality-over-price-in-public-building-tenders](-to-place-greater-emphasis-on-quality-over-price-in-public-building-tenders)

So, the company that can squeeze the most margin it can by cutting every possible corner legally tends to stay alive. Typically, such race to the bottom sort of competition would favor companies with deep pockets to out price everyone else (ride sharing, e commerce) and then consolidate as a major player with economies of scale. But we don't see it in construction instead of fighting for your single 10 minute cab ride or $30 dollar 2nd hand bid, they are fighting for million dollar projects that span years. The consolidation does occur with bankruptcies, but here's a list of all the companies that can bid for projects in singapore back in 2016: [-of-construction-companies/](-of-construction-companies/) and they all exist in different tiers.

We could force the costs down their throats, say that workers require XYZ amount of space and living conditions. Where would the cost go? back to the construction project. If squeezing margin out from worker dorms isn't possible, it'd then be reflected back in bidders in the construction project bidding process, and back into the society. Sure, we'd ""fix"" one major sticking point here, but where would the margin come from still? corners cut from infrastructure? worker wages? more bankruptcies and consolidation which can take years to do? 

In the short term, sure, we can ""fine"" the companies and the dorm operators. Just remember that these dorms exist with BCA's full knowledge of them being in the conditions that they are. I don't think punishment is the way to go, but incentivizing innovation and progressive treatment is the better way forward. Both would cost the society, one in indirect manners via cut corners, higher building costs, and destructive bankruptcies and consolidation. The other is a direct cost that we can monitor and help push for a fundamental change in the industry for lower reliance on cheap replaceable labor, replacing them with more effective individuals that are highly skilled, and well paid.

FWIW, I've commented on this a few times:

"My personal thoughts align to a large degree with yours.

I think WP will get Aljunied and Hougang (possibly with a slightly more comfortable margin than in 2015).

SMC with highest flip chance for me is Bukit Panjang. The retirement of the incumbent might see just enough votes going over to the oppo.

Bukit Batok, I still don't see it happening. CSJ might actually break 40% this time though.

As for GRCs, I think East Coast GRC will be closer to 2011 elections than 2015 (50+% for the PAP) with a good oppo fielding in the GRC. People overestimate HSK's blunder imo, it will have an effect but will be buried under other issues and be forgotten/rationalized away to some degree by the time polling day comes about. Nevertheless, even a weak 50% mandate for the PM-designate will be damaging to the PAP.

Finally, for West Coast, I think a below 5% margin would already be a very good showing for a new party like the PSP. IMO other than Dr Tan, PSP candidates still have too low of a public recognition outside of Reddit. Their best bet would be to strive for the best result and work the ground really hard over the next 4-5 years.

"I have been to a number of dormitories, even multiple times in a single dormitory and it is simply not as abysmal as how you portray it to be. First of all it is definitely not a prison, usually in dormitories there are leisure areas: street soccer and basketball courts being more common while some even have gyms that are equipped enough for the general gym goer(dumbbells and machines) and multi purpose halls that can be used to play badminton. Normally there's also WiFi in each room because the workers all come together and subscribe to one isp so it's not like they have nothing to do when they're in their bunks during their free time. Secondly, they are not locked in their rooms, they are free to wander around the dormitories. I will not assume that they are allowed to use the leisure facilities but if they want to go out and take a walk for a breathe of fresh air it's highly possible. There's also shop(s) in the dormitories that allow them to buy groceries and such although some that I have talked to prefer buying outside because these shops tend to charge higher prices. 

To the point of the conditions of rooms. Generally most rooms are clean . The cleanliness isn't top notch but it's definitely well kept and I'm fine with it. Having said that, cleanliness is also directly dependent on the actions of those living in the room; I have gone to different rooms in the same building and it isn't the same. Some rooms are clean while others have baby cockroaches running around. Ventilation is also usually not a problem, fans are provided in the dorms and not once have I broken a sweat while working in their rooms. I've even worked when all the workers return home from work and it isn't as warm as you think. I've gone to some residential houses where the conditions are worse than a dormitory. Smelly, messy with horrible ventilation. 

To put it simply, yes some of their residential areas aren't ideal. But it's satisfactory in the sense that it's clean and they have areas to be alone or if they want to enjoy the company of others. Workers can't change their living conditions but they have the ability to decide how clean they want their bunks to be. Yes I'm aware that there are companies or dormitories that do not care about the welfare of workers and workers are forced into dormitories with unliveable conditions but I can safely say that its the minority. Please do not write such things about the condition of their living areas when you don't know much about them especially when you've not even been in their rooms because it is painting a  picture based on your false perception which will misguide the public while being unfair for companies/bosses that really take care of their workers.",2020-04-08 08:37:27,reddit,number even multiple times single simply not abysmal portray first definitely not prison usually leisure areas street soccer basketball courts common even gyms equipped enough general gym goer dumbbells machines multi purpose halls used play badminton normally also wifi room come together subscribe one isp not like nothing bunks free time secondly not locked rooms free wander around not assume allowed use leisure facilities want go take walk breathe fresh air highly possible also shop allow buy groceries although talked prefer buying outside shops tend charge higher prices point conditions rooms generally rooms clean cleanliness top notch definitely well kept fine said cleanliness also directly dependent actions living room gone different rooms building rooms clean others baby cockroaches running around ventilation also usually not problem fans provided not broken sweat working rooms even worked return home work warm think gone residential houses conditions worse smelly messy horrible ventilation put simply yes residential areas ideal satisfactory sense clean areas alone want enjoy company others change living conditions ability decide clean want bunks yes aware companies not care welfare forced unliveable conditions safely say minority please not write things condition living areas know much especially not even rooms painting picture based false perception misguide public unfair companies bosses really take care

"> # Employers must let their foreign workers move to other dorms or work for other firms to get levy rebates: MOM

> SINGAPORE - Employers here will have to let the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) move their foreign workers to different dormitories or work at another company in need of manpower in order to get the foreign worker levy (FWL) rebates announced in last week's Fortitude Budget.

> In a statement on Sunday (May 31), MOM said that in view of the support given, employers must also continue paying the salaries of foreign workers who are unable to work due to the Covid-19 situation.

> ""In such cases, employers should work out mutually agreed salary and leave arrangements with the unions and workers.

> ""Foreign workers who are assigned to work full-time should be paid their prevailing salaries,"" said the ministry.

> Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, who is also Finance Minister, had announced on May 26 that the Government will extend the FWL waivers and rebates for up to two months, for businesses not allowed to resume operations after the circuit breaker period.

> The waiver will be 100 per cent in June, and 50 per cent in July, while the rebate will be $750 in June, and $375 in July.

> These apply to businesses not in the Ministry of Trade and Industry's permitted list on GoBusiness Portal, along with all businesses in construction, marine shipyard and process sectors.

> To receive the rebates, MOM said the employers will have to accept two conditions.

> First, they must allow MOM to move work permit holders and S Pass holders cleared of Covid-19 from existing dormitories to a cleared dormitory, to facilitate workers returning to work.

> Related Story Foreign worker levy waiver, rebates extended by up to 2 months for firms unable to resume work after circuit breaker

> Related Story Why Singapore cannot cut down on foreign workers the way other countries have

> ""Employers may be required to terminate the leases with their current dormitory operator to recontract with a new dormitory operator,"" said MOM.

> Second, the employers must allow MOM to second or transfer their workers to another company that needs workers, but whose own workers are in dormitories that have not been cleared.

> All employers must make an online acknowledgement of the conditions by June 10.

> ""This support will taper off as we ease out of the circuit breaker and restart our economy.

> ""Businesses that expect to restart later are encouraged to reassess their foreign manpower needs and adjust their workforce accordingly,"" MOM said.

"About 250 Indians, with nearly half of them staying in close contact in the dormitories for foreign workers, have tested positive for the coronavirus in Singapore, the Indian High Commission here said on Friday.Indian High Commissioner Jawed Ashraf told PTI that almost all of the Indians who have the disease are mostly stable or improving.He said that the about 250 Indian nationals, who are suffering from the disease, include some permanent residents.Of the infected Indians, nearly 50 per cent are from dormitories for foreign workers, which have emerged as the disease spreading points in the country.The first cases from the dormitories were reported on March 29, but the number of infections has climbed to 460, of which about 200 were confirmed on Thursday.As the country has ramped up aggressive testing in the dormitories, the numbers are expected to climb in the next few days.Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the COVID-19 task force, said coronavirus cases in the foreign worker dormitories will continue to rise in the coming days and perhaps even in the coming weeks or so.""But we do have a comprehensive strategy and measures are in place, and the agencies are now working round the clock to execute and implement them,"" The Straits Times quoted the Minister as saying on Friday.Noting that foreign workers will still be providing public services such as cleaning, Wong urged people not to be prejudiced against them.""It''s not because of a foreign worker being inherently of higher risk - the risk of infection for the rest of us in the population is the same, regardless of nationality, regardless of race,"" he stressed.Singapore authorities are working to improve the living conditions in dormitories and relocating workers in other accommodations, including empty Housing Development Board flats and Army facilities, according to local media reports.Meanwhile, Indian High Commissioner Ashraf said that the post-mortem report of a 32-year-old Indian man, who died on April 8, confirmed that he passed away because of a heart condition and not due to the COVID-19 as reported earlier.The deceased was advised to stay at home after he underwent the coronavirus test on April 7.As the international flights are suspended due to the lockdown in India, it would be difficult to immediately send back the deceased''s body, an informed source said, adding Singapore authorities are expected to speak to the deceased''s family.Singapore reported 287 cases of coronavirus on Thursday, taking the total of 1,910.

"Ex-Deputy Prime Ministers Tharman and Teo Chee Hean brought in to handle manpower matters -deputy-prime...r-matters/After Senior Ministers Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Teo Chee Hean were roped in to handle manpower matters like the jobs council and the foreign worker dormitories situation, some Singaporeans are speculating whether Manpower Minister Josephine Teo was given too big a portfolio for her to cope with.Mr Tharman and Mr Teo served as Singapore’s Deputy Prime Ministers from 2011 to 2019. The pair stepped down from their posts and became Senior Ministers on 1 May 2019, following a Cabinet reshuffle that was designed to give fourth-generation (4G) ministers more exposure and responsibilities so that they can better support the next Prime Minister who will come from their cohort.The Cabinet reshuffle saw the ruling People’s Action Party’s (PAP) 4G cohort accept several promotions that resulted in them leading two-thirds of the Government’s ministries. Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat kept his ministry but also succeeded Mr Tharman and Mr Teo as Singapore’s sole Deputy Prime Minister, giving rise to speculation that he is the ruling party’s Prime Minister designate.Besides Mr Tharman and Mr Teo, fellow veteran politician Lim Swee Say stepped down from his post as Manpower Minister and was succeeded by Josephine Teo, who became Singapore’s second female minister to helm a ministry after Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu.While Mr Tharman and Mr Teo seemed to take a backseat to allow the younger ministers to take charge, they have now taken on important responsibilities that pertain to manpower.Current DPM Heng Swee Keat tapped on Mr Tharman to chair the new National Jobs Council. Asserting that his predecessor has “both detailed knowledge and deep expertise in this issue” in his latest supplementary budget speech last month, Mr Heng revealed that the National Jobs Council will focus on creating jobs and helping workers build deep skills to stay employable in the challenging economy.Mr Teo was brought in to handle the foreign worker dormitories issue after COVID-19 outbreaks in the dorms ended up infecting over 33,567 workers and counting. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that Mr Teo is playing an advisory role in the Government’s inter agency task force to handle the situation in the dorms.The veteran politicians’ involvement in what are perceived as manpower matters has raised questions about the capabilities of Manpower Minister Josephine Teo.Mrs Teo was just recently under public scrutiny for the way she handled the COVID-19 outbreaks at the foreign worker dormitories. Some Singaporeans blamed the minister for allowing the COVID-19 situation to spiral out of control among migrant workers even though she was warned in advance that this might happen due to the workers’ overcrowded living conditions.When she was asked why she did not act early in implementing safe distancing measures in the dorms before the coronavirus infection spread uncontrolled, Mrs Teo did not apologise and instead blamed a lack of hindsight.Expressing a wish to “rewind the clock” to implement safe distancing measures in the dorms earlier, she told the local press: “If possible, I really wish to know at which stage the infection has already spread to community and migrant workers group? If time can be rewound, this is what I wish I could know.”Hi Dumbfark,please provide proper link lah u knnb xxx",2020-06-06 10:31:00,sgtalk,ex deputy prime ministers tharman teo chee hean brought handle manpower matters deputy prime r matters senior ministers tharman shanmugaratnam teo chee hean roped handle manpower matters like jobs council situation singaporeans speculating whether manpower minister josephine teo given big portfolio cope mr tharman mr teo served singapore deputy prime ministers 2011 2019 pair stepped posts became senior ministers 1 may 2019 following cabinet reshuffle designed give fourth generation 4g ministers exposure responsibilities better support next prime minister come cohort cabinet reshuffle saw ruling people action party pap 4g cohort accept several promotions resulted leading two thirds government ministries finance minister heng swee keat kept ministry also succeeded mr tharman mr teo singapore sole deputy prime minister giving rise speculation ruling party prime minister designate besides mr tharman mr teo fellow veteran politician lim swee say stepped post manpower minister succeeded josephine teo became singapore second female minister helm ministry minister culture community youth grace fu mr tharman mr teo seemed take backseat allow younger ministers take charge taken important responsibilities pertain manpower current dpm heng swee keat tapped mr tharman chair new national jobs council asserting predecessor detailed knowledge deep expertise issue latest supplementary budget speech last month mr heng revealed national jobs council focus creating jobs helping build deep skills stay employable challenging economy mr teo brought handle issue outbreaks ended infecting 33 567 counting prime minister lee hsien loong said mr teo playing advisory role government inter agency task force handle situation veteran politicians involvement perceived manpower matters raised questions capabilities manpower minister josephine teo mrs teo recently public scrutiny way handled outbreaks singaporeans blamed minister allowing situation spiral control among even though warned advance might happen due overcrowded living conditions asked not act early implementing safe distancing measures infection spread uncontrolled mrs teo not apologise instead blamed lack hindsight expressing wish rewind clock implement safe distancing measures earlier told local press possible really wish know stage infection already spread community group time rewound wish could know hi dumbfark please provide proper link u knnb xxx

"Simplest explanation is that you don't punish a Tiger for biting a human. It's just in its nature to do so. We expect corporations to be profiteering and cutting corners whenever they can. We know that is how they behave. 

But that is why we have governments and laws. Governments job is to constrain corporations from doing bad things while allowing profits to flow. What can we people do? We have no power to riot or protest, government took those away from us. The only player here with any real power to constrain these companies is the government, not us. You literally cannot hold your pitchfork outside these dorms, you will go to jail for protesting. 

Additionally we have warned the Government many times that this has been happening. As an analogy, imagine if a murderer is running rampant in your neighbourhood. After the first murder, you can say its the murderer's fault. So you complain to the police to ask him to get caught. But the police does nothing. After the 5th or 6th murder, the neighbourhood would be faulting the police too right? And then you come along and tell your neighbours ""why are you blaming the police but dont  blame the murderer""? What can your neighbours do? 

First time it happens, can say its the dorm operators. But please la, we've known about this overcrowding and unhygienic problem for donkey years and have complained to MOM.

"Meh, his point, which could be better put, is less that it's not racist, and more that it's classist rather than racist. 

What many people seem to forget is that while Bangladeshis make up the bulk of our foreign workers, we actually have a good number of PRC foreign workers (talking about those in construction and cleaning, since that's the same classification for the Bangladeshis. We actually do have rich or middle class Bangladeshis in Singapore)

People don't want to live near poorer people (in general), since it's common to perceive that poorer people bring with them more social problems. This is near universal. 

Classism is not mutually exclusive with racism. There are some truly racist people. But not all classist people are racist people, and not all racist people are classist.

"I think you’re looking at it from just one perspective of healthcare but you need to remember that the government has the uphill task of balancing all sectors of the country. It’s how to balance everything with minimal effect to daily lives or minimal effort for recovery after all is over because damage is inevitable. It’s definitely not an easy task, and many people seem to glance over this point when they criticize the policies enacted. 

Sure, it’s easy to say close schools and work places. But that would have downstream effects which you need to plan for very carefully and prepare for. I think that secretly, they have been ramping up the efforts in the background without telling us exactly what they’re doing. For example the recently abandoned precinct near my place due to en bloc is now being refitted with many new facilities, with rumors that it will be a quarantine/SHN center. There’s absolutely no news about that, but residents are seeing the work done and the urgency of speed that it’s done at, it’s not hard to put two and two together.  Also when you start to look at everything from multiple angles you really start to fathom how critically complex the whole response and coordination is and that’s when you realize that the government has been many steps ahead of where they are. This is not something many people come to realize in the midst of of their criticism. So it’s easy to stand there and say “they should have done this and that” in hindsight, but it’s all people speaking from the limited knowledge they have. Granted, I do not know much too but I can understand and see why the policies and implemented the way they are. 

And to blame the government on such issues they are receiving heat for, it’s not all fair to them. At the end of the day, the government makes the policies but it is the people who enact them. We wouldn’t have needed to reach the stage of a CB if the common folk took social distancing more seriously. Look at the queues at ikea, supermarkets, etc even after the CB is announced.

"If govt channels back the funds from the levy into improving living conditions (through subsidising dorms, food etc), that kind of defeats the purpose of the levy because the money will go back to the employer. 

And another problem with improving living conditions can be very subjective - current [purpose built dorms](-worker-dormitories) are already tendered out and regulated by BCA, meaning they have standards to meet such as X m2 of space per pax, cleaning schedules etc. You can only go so far in mandating that the operator meets certain living standards that are quantifiable such as cleaning schedules, caloric requirements per meal, personal space per pax. How about regulating subjective things like taste of food or cuisine, dirty personal accomodation (which can be a lapse in the dorm operator's obligations or lack of personal hygiene by the residents)? Because if you want to penalise or reward dorm operators based on meeting these standards, there must be something that you can measure, not based on opinion. 

I'm not defending or criticising dorm operators and the regulators - but there are challenges with regards to regulation in general and things will never be black and white. It's very easy to be an armchair critic because we are not exposed to the stakeholders' situation, the quirks of each situation etc. It's never blame on one party, and the way the government acts is representative of society's stand on that issue - in this case that largely, society wants FWs kept to a minimum, out of sight, out of mind, and the bare minimum for them.",2020-04-13 09:31:20,reddit,govt channels back funds levy improving living conditions subsidising food etc kind defeats purpose levy money go back employer another problem improving living conditions subjective current purpose built already tendered regulated bca meaning standards meet x m2 space per pax cleaning schedules etc go far mandating operator meets certain living standards quantifiable cleaning schedules caloric requirements per meal personal space per pax regulating subjective things like taste food cuisine dirty personal accomodation lapse operator obligations lack personal hygiene residents want penalise reward operators based meeting standards must something measure not based opinion not defending criticising operators regulators challenges regards regulation general things never black white easy armchair critic not exposed stakeholders situation quirks situation etc never blame one party way government acts representative society stand issue case largely society wants fws kept minimum sight mind bare minimum

"Ok first of I'd like to say that I'm not intentionally being edgy. And I'm fine with using my real name because I haven't said anything that I'm ashamed of, and if anyone tries to doxx me, they automatically lose all moral high ground. Let me rephrase what I'm trying to say here: the workers should be given the best possible conditions that we can afford. Key phrase: that we can afford. And when I say ""take office first"", I don't literally mean that you have to assume an official position in order to try and enact change, I'm asking you to look at it from a different perspective. It's very easy to criticise but if you were actually there on the ground trying to recruit volunteers, distribute medical supplies, and relocate healthcare workers, I think you would better appreciate what is already being done. I'm not saying it's perfect, not by a long shot, but I'm saying that I trust the government is doing all that it can within a reasonable capacity. I do agree that there are and will continue to be flaws, lapses and slip-ups, but I also trust that such issues will be addressed in the fastest and best possible way. I mean already in that article it outlined how efforts were being made to improve living conditions: ""cleanliness and hygiene being stepped up""', ""sickbays being scaled up"", ""thousands of workers moving to army camps, floating hotels and empty HDBs"" to ease up on the cramped conditions... I mean it doesn't really sound a lot like Omelas to me, sounds like they're actually trying hard to make it better.

Second point about hierarchy. I maintain that the Singpore government's first priority rightfully is, and always should be, Singaporean nationals. Does this mean that we should simply neglect everyone else and leave them to die in crowded conditions? Of course not! But consider if we quarantined all 20,000 workers identically to how we have been quarantining our own citizens. Our systems would be completely overwhelmed in no time. It would leave no margin whatsoever for future infections, many of whom would be nationals. If we had the space and the resources then of course they should give workers the same conditions, but sadly this isn't the case. I just want to put across the point that when we have such limited resources, no matter what couse of action you take there is always going to be someone who loses out.

Okay, as for the bit where you said this isn't just for the government, it's for everyone, I agree with you almost completely. However, it is incredibly difficult to see any kind of change coming about in the immediate future. And frankly, you should be the change that you want to see. If you're really passionate about this, then you should volunteer to cook/clean for the workers. You might say, ""oh I'm busy, I still have to work from home, etc etc"", all of which is perfectly understandable. Then maybe you should consider that this is the same situatiom which other Singaporeans are in. Now again, I'm not saying, ""you must be a volunteer, then only you can talk about how people should be more sympathetic"", I'm just saying that if everyone expressed concern online but never enacted any real change, people would be a lot more caring for our workers but the actual workers' situations would not improve.",2020-04-10 10:39:08,reddit,ok first like say not intentionally edgy fine using real name said anything ashamed anyone tries doxx automatically lose moral high ground let rephrase trying say should given best possible conditions afford key phrase afford say take office first literally mean assume official position order try enact change asking look different perspective easy criticise actually ground trying recruit volunteers distribute medical supplies relocate healthcare think would better appreciate already done not saying perfect not long shot saying trust government within reasonable capacity agree continue flaws lapses slip ups also trust issues addressed fastest best possible way mean already article outlined efforts made improve living conditions cleanliness hygiene stepped sickbays scaled thousands moving army camps floating hotels empty hdbs ease cramped conditions mean doesn really sound lot like omelas sounds like actually trying hard make better second point hierarchy maintain singpore government first priority rightfully always should singaporean nationals mean should simply neglect everyone else leave die crowded conditions course not consider quarantined 20 000 identically quarantining citizens systems would completely overwhelmed no time would leave no margin whatsoever future infections many would nationals space resources course should give conditions sadly case want put across point limited resources no matter couse action take always going someone loses okay bit said government everyone agree almost completely however incredibly difficult see kind change coming immediate future frankly should change want see really passionate should volunteer cook clean might say oh busy still work home etc etc perfectly understandable maybe should consider situatiom singaporeans not saying must volunteer talk people should sympathetic saying everyone expressed concern online never enacted real change people would lot caring actual situations would not improve

"MASKS NOW COMPULSORY FOR ALL SINGAPOREANS WHEN THEY HEAD OUT  ...-wong-12640828SINGAPORE: It is now mandatory to wear a mask when stepping out of the house, with some exceptions, announced Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong on Tuesday (Apr 14). The mask-wearing requirement takes effect immediately, said Mr Wong, as he spoke at a press conference conducted by the multi-ministry task force tackling COVID-19. Individuals who are caught refusing to wear a mask will be fined S$300 on their first offence, while those who flout the rule a second time will be fined S$1,000. Egregious cases will be prosecuted in court, he added. Foreign residents caught breaching these rules might have their work passes or permanent resident status revoked.Mr Wong, who co-chairs the the task force with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, noted that the Government had updated its advisory on masks based on the ""latest medical and scientific advice and that the exercise to distribute reusable masks to Singaporeans was completed over the weekend. Now that we have distributed the mask to everyone and generally people have started to adjust to the new requirements or the advisory, we are making it mandatory for all, said Mr Wong.;The minute you leave your room, or you leave your house, you have to wear a mask when you go out.READ: Singapore's COVID-19 cases exceed 3,000 with 334 new infections; situation remains 'critical'Children below the age of two will not need to wear a mask based on medical experts recommendations on child safety, he said. As for adults, only those who are engaging in strenuous exercises like running and jogging do not have to wear a mask, but they will have to put it on once they stop exercising. Mr Wong also reiterated the need for them to maintain a safe distance from others when they are exercising. We are very happy that many Singaporeans and residents are cooperating and doing their part, and complying with these measures, said Mr Wong, noting that movement across the island has reduced significantly. With safe distancing ambassadors and enforcement officers hard at work on the ground, hotspots like wet markets, hawker centres and parks are generally now under control, he said.Most people are doing the right thing. There are a few who are not and they will be dealt with.Acknowledging that some people are finding it hard to adjust to the circuit breaker measures and are suffering from cabin fever, Mr Wong said the Government has had to reject many appeals for activities. We cannot let up at this stage. These are still early days and we have at least another three more weeks to go. So we have to double down on our efforts and just stay at home. About 20 per cent of the workforce comprises essential workers and continue to travel to their workplaces, Mr Wong noted.

"> # Over 10m meals served to foreign workers confined to dorms

> More than 10 million meals have been served to foreign workers since some purpose-built dormitories went into lockdown, with food caterers seeking to address concerns raised about their quality and quantity.

> This is no mean feat, as noted by Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad, who said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that the inter-agency task force set up to support the workers would have served over 10 million meals to those in the purpose-built dorms by this weekend.

> He said there are 34 professional caterers providing meals to about 200,000 workers - akin to catering for the whole of Ang Mo Kio GRC. The Government is footing the bill for all meals in purpose-built dorms. It is not clear how much the caterers are charging but one of them, Neo Group, said it charges only for ingredients and labour costs.

> Teething issues early on sparked criticism about the quality, quantity and the type of cuisine served up but this has improved, said Mr Zaqy.

> He told The Straits Times that these issues stemmed from logistics challenges generated by the sheer number of residents in the dorms.

> The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is now ensuring that meals are delivered to residents within 30 minutes of their arrival at the dorms. Tests are also being done with workers from different countries to ensure that the food suits their tastes.

> ""Some of them prefer a certain variety of rice, like ponni rice, and requested the rice to be cooked for a longer period of time,"" said Mr Zaqy.

> The first catered meal given to Bangladeshi Ahammad Md Ali, 27, when his dorm was gazetted as an isolation area and locked down about two weeks ago was a bag of rice and Indian curry.

> He was happy to chomp it down but some of his Bangladeshi friends at Westlite Mandai dormitory found it harder to stomach.

> ""The food is OK to 'makan' (eat in Malay), but Bangladeshi food is different from Indian food. Some of us are only used to Bangladeshi food,"" said Mr Ahammad, a safety coordinator who has worked here for seven years.

> ""Bangladeshi food is less salty. We gave feedback, the next day they sent Bangladeshi food,"" he added, noting that he usually cooks his own meals in the dorm.

> The Covid-19 outbreak has resulted in about 300,000 workers having their movements restricted due to quarantine or stay-home notices, prompting the authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and employers to step in to ensure that daily needs are met.

> ACTION AFTER FEEDBACK The food is OK to 'makan' (eat in Malay), but Bangladeshi food is different from Indian food, some of us are only used to Bangladeshi food... Bangladeshi food is less salty. We gave feedback, the next day they sent Bangladeshi food. BANGLADESHI AHAMMAD MD ALI, a safety coordinator who has worked here for seven years.

> Meanwhile, the Covid-19 Migrant Support Coalition comprising NGOs and ground-up initiatives has provided around 17,000 meals to workers in factory-converted dorms and other types of accommodation over the past three weeks.

> Migrant Workers' Centre chairman Yeo Guat Kwang said in this ""unprecedented situation"" everyone, including workers and caterers, has had to adapt and adjust: ""It's understandable the workers are upset at the restrictions.

> ""Just like you and me, it's hard to give up choice and habits, such as being able to cook for yourself.""

> Indian construction worker Kandan Gopinath, 41, said the food in his PPT Lodge 1A dorm has improved over the past week.

> When the dorm was gazetted as an isolation area on April 19, the meals were bland as they lacked the spices he was used to.

> ""The rice was half-cooked and there were only boiled vegetables and a little curry,"" he said, adding that things changed after he raised the issue with the dorm operator.

> ""These few days, the food has been good, like fish curry. But sometimes it can be very oily,"" he said.

> Similarly, caterers who have taken on the task of feeding the hundreds of thousands of workers have had to adapt to the diets of at least six different nationalities.

> Catering Solutions, which provides food for five purpose-built dorms, has ramped up its production from 20,000 meals a day to almost 70,000 in the past few weeks, said director Shanmugam Ganesan.

> It had previously been catering for workers at Jurong Shipyard and Sembcorp Marine in Tuas, but providing for a bigger group has seen it tweaking its menus according to workers' feedback. It provides Chinese, Indian, Bangladeshi and Punjabi dishes.

> ""We adjusted the kinds of fish, vegetables and portioning of curries,"" said Mr Shanmugam, adding that extra portions of rice are also prepared just in case.

> Catering Solutions has hired 60 workers to add to its workforce of 100 and tapped technology - it has a number of chapati-making machines - to increase production.

> Its kitchens are working 24 hours a day, up from 18, to provide pre-dawn meals for Muslim workers in the dorms during Ramadan.

"MOH released a press release today on Scaling up of testing for COVID-19.-highligh...vid-19-testing 27TH APR 20201. Testing is a critical enabler of our fight against COVID-19. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been steadily building up our national capacity to conduct tests for COVID-19. From an average of 2,900 tests per day in early April, we are now able to conduct more than 8,000 tests per day. To date, Singapore has tested about 2,100 per 100,000 persons. In comparison, the US has tested 1,600 per 100,000 and the UK 1,000 per 100,000. The higher intensity of testing allows us to pick up far more cases than many other countries.2. We have taken steps to continue building up our testing capacity over the coming weeks and months. Even as we do so, we will continue to prioritise our existing testing capacity based on public health considerations.Testing for Diagnosis and Surveillance3. Testing is used for three key purposes. First, for diagnosis in order to provide the appropriate treatment early for persons who are unwell. Second, for active case finding in order to identity infected individuals early and isolate them. Contact tracing around confirmed cases allows us to ring-fence any clusters, and prevent further transmissions. And third, for surveillance purposes, in particular of groups at higher risk of contracting or transmitting the disease.4. Such testing is done systematically across our hospitals, polyclinics and general practitioner clinics. We test high risk groups showing symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI), such as those who are close contacts of confirmed cases, those with travel history, patients already diagnosed with pneumonia, or patients with prolonged ARI. We also conduct testing as a means of general surveillance to detect signs of community spread and to pick up unlinked cases.Testing in the Migrant Worker Dormitories5. A similar testing strategy is applied to our migrant worker community, including those living in dormitories. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has been testing close to 3,000 migrant workers residing at the dormitories every day, and will continue to do more tests. Many of these workers showed no symptoms when they were tested. In most countries, people who are asymptomatic are not tested. To date, more than 21,000 migrant workers living in dormitories have been tested. This means that we have tested about one in 15 workers in dormitories (or 6,500 per 100,000), far higher than the testing rates seen in countries like South Korea (one in 90, or 1,100 per 100,000).6. This aggressive testing regime enables us to determine the extent of infection in the dormitories. Those who are confirmed with COVID-19 infection will be reported in the daily tally of newly confirmed cases. We started with the dormitories with a higher incidence of infections, and are continuing to test the workers in the other dormitories.7. Due to the need to prioritise, we are not be able to test all in the dormitories at one go. But if any worker were to report sick or show ARI symptoms, we will immediately pull aside and isolate the worker from his room-mates, and ensure that he receives the necessary medical care. This allows us to provide medical care quickly to the symptomatic foreign workers, and to ensure that those with higher risk factors or have more severe illnesses are transferred to receive care at our healthcare institutions.8. One urgent priority is to test migrant workers who have moved out of the dormitories but are continuing to work in essential services. This is to reduce the risk of transmission in workplaces and to the wider community.Testing for Protection and Monitoring9. Finally, we are doing more tests to protect vulnerable groups. For instance, we are testing the staff at nursing homes where there is close contact with seniors, as well as healthcare workers and frontline officers who have regular contact with confirmed cases. This will help to ensure that they continue to stay healthy, and receive medical treatment promptly if required.10. As more testing capacity is brought on-stream, we will gradually expand testing to the wider pool of workers in order to ensure the continuity of critical functions and services. This is important, as it will also enable us to progressively resume economic activities beyond the circuit breaker period.Holistic Strategy11. While testing is important, it has to be part of a broader strategy to fight COVID-19. Testing alone cannot substitute for other important measures like safe distancing and infection control. Individual responsibility in upholding good personal hygiene, minimising contact, and seeing a doctor immediately when sick are all critical aspects of the overall strategy. Together, we can slow down transmissions, beat the virus, and emerge stronger after the crisis.MINISTRY OF HEALTH27 APRIL 2020",2020-04-27 21:28:00,hardwarezone,moh released press release today scaling testing highligh vid testing 27th apr 20201 testing critical enabler fight against multi ministry taskforce steadily building national capacity conduct tests average 2 900 tests per day early april able conduct 8 000 tests per day date singapore tested 2 100 per 100 000 persons comparison us tested 1 600 per 100 000 uk 1 000 per 100 000 higher intensity testing allows us pick far many countries 2 taken steps continue building testing capacity coming weeks months even continue prioritise existing testing capacity based public health considerations testing diagnosis surveillance3 testing used three key purposes first diagnosis order provide appropriate treatment early persons unwell second active case finding order identity infected individuals early isolate contact tracing around confirmed allows us ring fence clusters prevent transmissions third surveillance purposes particular groups higher risk contracting transmitting disease 4 testing done systematically across hospitals polyclinics general practitioner clinics test high risk groups showing symptoms acute respiratory infection ari close contacts confirmed travel history patients already diagnosed pneumonia patients prolonged ari also conduct testing means general surveillance detect signs community spread pick unlinked testing dormitories5 similar testing strategy applied community including living ministry health moh testing close 3 000 residing every day continue tests many showed no symptoms tested countries people asymptomatic not tested date 21 000 living tested means tested one 15 6 500 per 100 000 far higher testing rates seen countries like south korea one 90 1 100 per 100 000 6 aggressive testing regime enables us determine extent infection confirmed infection reported daily tally newly confirmed started higher incidence infections continuing test 7 due need prioritise not able test one go report sick show ari symptoms immediately pull aside isolate room mates ensure receives necessary medical care allows us provide medical care quickly symptomatic ensure higher risk factors severe illnesses transferred receive care healthcare institutions 8 one urgent priority test moved continuing work essential services reduce risk transmission workplaces wider community testing protection monitoring9 finally tests protect vulnerable groups instance testing staff nursing homes close contact seniors well healthcare frontline officers regular contact confirmed help ensure continue stay healthy receive medical treatment promptly required 10 testing capacity brought stream gradually expand testing wider pool order ensure continuity critical functions services important also enable us progressively resume economic activities beyond circuit breaker period holistic strategy11 testing important part broader strategy fight testing alone cannot substitute important measures like safe distancing infection control individual responsibility upholding good personal hygiene minimising contact seeing doctor immediately sick critical aspects overall strategy together slow transmissions beat emerge stronger crisis ministry health27 april 2020

"> # Coronavirus: Cruise ships assessed for feasibility to temporarily house healthy foreign workers

> SINGAPORE - Cruise ships are being assessed for their feasibility as temporary housing for foreign workers who are recovered from Covid-19 and tested negative for the virus.

> SuperStar Gemini and SuperStar Aquarius, mid-sized cruise ships operated by Genting Cruise Lines, will be checked for consideration by the Government for factors such as ventilation systems, security protocols and infection control measures.

> If deemed feasible, the two cruise ships may be used to complement other interim facilities such as Singapore Armed Forces military camps and vacant Housing Board blocks that have been refurbished to house healthy workers.

> By reducing numbers of workers in existing dormitories, health measures can be implemented more effectively, said the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in a media statement on Friday (April 17) morning.

> Cruise ships are being considered for use as temporary housing as they have readily available rooms and en-suite toilets to minimise person-to-person contact, added STB.

> SuperStar Gemini, which arrived from Hong Kong on Friday, is berthed at Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore. SuperStar Aquarius may be activated for assessment at a later date.

> If deemed suitable, the two ships may accommodate up to 2,000 foreign workers in total.

> STB said that ""if activated, every effort will be made to uphold the health, welfare and security of foreign workers on board the ship, where they will be expected to observe the highest standards of safe distancing at all times"".

> Foreign workers would also be allowed scheduled outdoor time on the vessels and would be provided with wireless Internet access.

> Related Story Coronavirus: 3 more foreign worker dormitories declared isolation areas

> Related Story Coronavirus: Floating facilities ready to house healthy foreign workers

> While the spread of the coronavirus in the wider community has held steady over the past two weeks, the number of cases linked to foreign workers in dormitories has risen exponentially.

> As of Friday morning, the total number of foreign workers linked to dorms who have tested positive for Covid-19 is 2,689, which is about 60 per cent of all Singapore's cases.

> There are now a total of 12 dormitories declared as isolation areas where workers at these lodgings must be quarantined in their rooms for 14 days.

"Yes, they may have died from other conditions, but I’m sure Covid must have played a part in leading to their demise as well. With Covid, and their other health problems, they are essentially fighting two health conditions at once. Which definitely takes a toll on one’s immune system.

If their immune system wasn’t too busy fighting Covid, these patients may have lived another few days. Without Covid, their body would only be fighting one serious health condition and they may have managed to find the strength to recover from that ONE serious health condition. With Covid-19 serving as an unfortunate distractor, the patient’s body’s resources were split up fighting TWO serious health conditions and I’m sure this must have played a part in terms of weakening the patient’s body

While the patient may have officially passed from reasons separate to the coronavirus, I’m certain that the coronavirus had at least a small part to play in their demise.

Classing their deaths as “non-Covid19” deaths is not the right call in my opinion as it plays down the severity of the virus [some people might say “oh look! these people died, but its not from the virus! this means other disease more scary than covid. covid not scary, might as well go out!”]",2020-04-17 01:14:48,reddit,yes may died conditions sure must played part leading demise well health problems essentially fighting two health conditions definitely takes toll one immune system immune system wasn busy fighting patients may lived another days without body would fighting one serious health condition may managed find strength recover one serious health condition serving unfortunate distractor patient body resources split fighting two serious health conditions sure must played part terms weakening patient body patient may officially passed reasons separate certain least small part play demise classing deaths non covid19 deaths not right call opinion plays severity people might say oh look people died not means disease scary not scary might well go

"Why the PAP has failed14 Feb - there was a foreign worker tested positive for COVID-19 and he was rushed into ICU a day later. 17 Feb - 2 more foreign workers were tested positive for the virus. 18 Feb - it was revealed that they formed a new cluster from a work site.News came out and employers rushed to send their foreign workers, who are unwell, to the hospital for a swab test.19 Feb - MOM published a news article from Mr Kelvin Teoh (divisional director of MOM for foreign workers) that employers must not send the foreign workers to the hospital or they may have their WORK PASS privileges suspended. Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet. The poor foreign workers in numbers of 300,000 became victims of the PAP government, due to their lack of hindsight and that huge stench of arrogance to listen to the public when many threads about the issue was raised in and around mid Feb.

"While I agree that companies who take risks to maximise profits should bear the brunt of the risk should things go wrong (i.e. in this case, providing shit living conditions to migrant workers to reduce operating costs), I think that for this one particular scenario, pushing all the costs (while rightfully so) to the dorm operators would only serve to harm the innocent parties, in this case the migrant workers. I have very little faith in these dorm operators to suddenly step up and spend their earnings to help solve the current issue at hand, and I predict they will leave most of their workers in the lurch, painting an even worse image of Singapore to the other countries.

"OMG! That's the reason employers of FDWs are very very scared and silent about it...no wonder lah...Conclusion bad move and decision by MOM...Coronavirus: Employers who send healthy workers to hospitals for Covid-19 test may get work pass privileges suspended, warns MOMSINGAPORE - Do not send employees to hospitals unless there is a medical emergency, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has warned employers, after hospitals reported that employers were dropping off workers to have them tested for the coronavirus.""Employers who act irresponsibly by misusing medical facilities may have their work pass privileges suspended,"" it added.In a message sent to employers seen by The Straits Times on Wednesday (Feb 19), Mr Kevin Teoh, divisional director of MOM's foreign manpower management division, said the ministry had been getting feedback from hospitals that employers were sending their workers to be tested for Covid-19, as the disease is now known.ST has contacted the Health Ministry for more information on the extent of such behaviour.Mr Teoh reminded employers that hospitals will not test individuals who are well.""This is to ensure that medical facilities and resources are focused on unwell individuals who need medical treatment,"" he said.A worker who is unwell should be sent to a general practitioner, who will then assess if the worker needs to be taken to hospital.""Our hospitals are working hard to ensure that medical emergencies are handled promptly,"" said Mr Teoh.""We encourage you to be socially responsible and only send workers to the hospital if it is a medical emergency, as doing so otherwise will deny immediate treatment to those who need it.""He added that employers should monitor the health of their workers by checking their temperature twice daily and reminding them to observe good personal hygiene, such as washing their hands with soap frequently. MOM has been taking employers and workers to task for not following rules restricting workers  entry and movements when returning from China.For example, it revoked the work passes of two workers and suspended their employers work pass privileges on Thursday (Feb 13) for breaching entry approval requirements.On Feb 9, it repatriated four work pass holders and suspended six employers for not complying with Leave of Absence rules.On Monday, the Government introduced the Stay-Home Notice scheme which requires all who return from China not to leave their homes for 14 days.MOM said the scheme also applies to all work pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China.This is stricter than the previous Leave of Absence scheme, where people could still leave their residence briefly for food and other necessities. ...-hospitals-forSo MOM really sabo SG.

"False dilemma.

I recognise this is likely a troll post, but let’s address the issue head on while we are at it.

For one, labour costs don’t make up the entirety of the costs in a product. Paying workers more may result in the final product being more expensive, but it’s not going to double it. 

In cases where the employer clearly has the capacity to pay their employers more but chooses to pocket the extra earnings, there should be more social pressure to make them shell out more. Otherwise, this is just going to impose a negative externality on society. They save money feeding the foreign workers scraps which they use to fund their lifestyle and the taxpayer is the one who has to deal with the inevitable social fallout. 

While one can argue that these business owners are taxpayers as well, the money they save from cutting these corners is likely way more than what they contribute in terms of tax anyways. 

The problem is also a lot more deep-seated than this. If we are to pay employees more, other costs will need to be lowered. The next elephant in the room is clearly the ridiculous rates for rent that some tenants charge, just because they can. Yet nobody goes after them because the obvious retort is - “not happy with my rates then don’t rent loh”. 

Let’s face it - the current system is broken. You can’t just patch one problem here or there without expecting some kind of ripple effect.",2020-04-18 12:37:53,reddit,false dilemma recognise likely troll post let address issue head one labour costs make entirety costs product paying may result final product expensive not going double employer clearly capacity pay employers chooses pocket extra earnings should social pressure make shell otherwise going impose negative externality society save money feeding scraps use fund lifestyle taxpayer one deal inevitable social fallout one argue business owners taxpayers well money save cutting corners likely way contribute terms tax anyways problem also lot deep seated pay employees costs need lowered next elephant room clearly ridiculous rates rent tenants charge yet nobody goes obvious retort not happy rates rent loh let face current system broken patch one problem without expecting kind ripple effect

"There are more than 40,000 Malaysians still in Singapore and the Malaysian state of Johor hopes that Singapore will make exemptions for them to be tested for Covid-19 before they are allowed to return to the state.More Malaysian workers are making their way back from Singapore after the Republic began implementing stricter measures to address the pandemic under a period known as the ""circuit breaker"". The measures which began on April 7 and will go on until May 4 have seen most workplaces and schools closed in order to reduce the risk of infections.Currently, Malaysians who test negative in Singapore will be able to go home and be quarantined there, while those without any certification or prior testing will be required to undergo compulsory 14-day quarantine at one of the government centres statewide.Johor Mentri Besar Hasni Mohammad said the state was working with the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the matter with their counterpart in Singapore given that the city-state presently does not conduct Covid-19 tests unless a person has showed symptoms.Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia Vanu Gopala Menon previously said there was currently no requirement by the Singapore government to provide random Covid-19 tests for foreign workers while Singapore's Ministry of Health has said that Covid-19 testing is only performed when clinically indicated, for patients and their close contacts.""That means a Malaysian can't get the test done in Singapore unless they are symptomatic, "" Datuk Hasni said in an interview in the Johor district of Iskandar Puteri.""We hope Singapore will allow for some exemptions so that Malaysians who want to return can get this test done at its clinics or hospitals, "" he said.Hasni said he was confident that the matter would be discussed through the Malaysia-Singapore Special Working Committee on Covid-19 for a solution to be reached.He said since Malaysia implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) on March 18 to curb the coronavirus, it has resolved certain issues, including easing the movement of cargo, essential and non-essential items between both countries as well as accommodation for Malaysian workers in Singapore.""The government will not stop Malaysians returning from Singapore and I can assure them that our frontliners have taken all the necessary steps and procedures at our border, "" he said.Hasni urged returning Malaysians to give their full cooperation to the frontliners conducting the necessary screening and testing at the checkpoints.On the number of Malaysians returning from Singapore after the island republic started its own measures to curb the spread of the virus, Hasni said the biggest influx was registered on April 3 with some 3,400 people.

Didn't we only scramble to find temporary dorms after the initial explosion of cases?

Do we assume that all mistakes are assigned the same reduction in score? Not only did the government not have the foresight (unlike our NGOs they were warning about it before) to see the risk in dorms, the fact remains that the dorm standards are below par for many of our migrant workers (again, something that the NGOs have been bringing up for years).

Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet.

"To add on, here is the issue I have with the argument being put forth by a poster here - revisedchampion.

Arguments which commit the hasty generalization fallacy have the following structure:

A is a very small part of B
X is observed in A 
Therefore, 
Generalization X is made about B.

His argument is basically as follows:

1) To show our support for foreign workers, we must basically agree to pay more for everything.

2) Any (rightful) concern about higher prices is dismissed as an indicator that we are unwilling to help foreign workers. Which I find to be very disingenuous.

3) Some valid points are raised below. For one, we don’t how much of the costs are being passed to us. Might we even see a situation where we are charged $X more, but only a fraction of that ends up going to actually improving the living conditions of the FWs, while the construction companies end up pocketing the rest? Ie: not only are they not footing a portion of the cost as they should, they are going so far as to use this as an opportunity to further gouge the consumer and line their own pockets even more.

"The Ministry of Defence (Mindef) started recruiting former Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) regulars as the inter-agency task force handling a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases at foreign worker dormitories had asked for “personnel with operational experience”.They were to augment the Forward Assurance Support Teams (Fast) deployed at various foreign worker dormitories, Mindef said in response to TODAY’s queries on Sunday (April 19).Manpower Minister Josephine Teo announced the formation of such teams on April 9 as part of the Government’s strategies to manage daily needs such as food, and ensure cleanliness and hygiene at those sites.At the time, she said that a team is assigned to each of the 43 purpose-built worker dormitories, and each team comprises nine officers from the SAF, police and the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).On Thursday, Mindef alerted the public through a Facebook post that fake recruitment messages were circulating through text messaging platforms, although it acknowledged that the ministry was indeed hiring former SAF regulars to support the task force.The fake messages asked interested former SAF regulars to submit their personal particulars to the ministry and PrimeStaff email addresses, and promised a pay package of S$5,000 to S$5,500 for every “completed month of work”. PrimeStaff is an employment agency.Giving more details on Sunday, Mindef said that it did not hold an open recruitment and had instead reached out to former regulars directly.It added that shortlisted candidates would undergo necessary training with the taskforce, including going on site visits, to familiarise themselves with their roles before being progressively deployed in the coming weeks.Mindef said it “takes the health and safety of our personnel seriously”.It is working closely with the taskforce to ensure that the appropriate precautionary measures for personnel involved in Covid-19 operations are implemented in accordance with the Ministry of Health’s guidelines.The inter-agency task force handling the Covid-19 outbreak at foreign workers’ dormitories was set up on April 7.

"this link is correct one-12624378SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 287 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday (Apr 9), the largest daily increase so far and more than double yesterday's highest record, the multi-ministry task force dealing with the coronavirus said during a press conference on Thursday (Apr 9).This brings the national tally to 1,910.Of the new cases, 219 are linked to existing clusters, with at least 160 cases linked to the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol.A total of 19 cases are linked to previous cases, with 46 unlinked cases, the task force said. Three of the latest cases announced are imported. 314 cases have been discharged from acute care, and 705 cases have been moved to a community isolation facility, the task force said. Singapore has also seen six fatalities from COVID-19, the task force said. It was reported on Wednesday a 32-year-old Indian national died after taking a swab test, and was confirmed to have COVID-19 after his death.READ: Day 2 of COVID-19 'circuit breaker' sees more than 3,000 breaches of safe distancing measuresAdvertisementThe task force said that with the help of the police and Ministry of Defence, it established a link between the  cluster at Mustafa Centre shopping mall and the Project Glory construction site as well as a number of foreign worker dormitories: S11 Dormitory@Punggol, Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tampines Dormitory Cochrane Lodge II  and Toh Guan Dormitory. Director of medical services at the Ministry of Health Assoc Prof Kenneth Mak described how some of the dormitory cases were linked to the Mustafa Centre cluster.""We believe that the workers had visited Mustafa and they subsequently transmitted the infection to their co-workers,"" he said.  ""Transmission most likely occurred through close contact,for example at meal times, during breaks, and also between co-workers at work due to physical proximity at work sites,"" he said.Subsequently, they could have spread the infection to colleagues and friends within the dormitories, he added. Singapore has seen a rise of COVID-19 cases at foreign worker domitories recently.Sungei Tengah Lodge became the fourth foreign worker dormitory to become an isolation area from midnight on Thursday, in a move aimed at preventing the spread of the disease.The other three dormitores that have been gazetted as isolation areas are: S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, Westlite Toh Guan dormitory and Toh Guan Dormitory.READ: COVID-19: Sungei Tengah Lodge declared an isolation area under Infectious Diseases ActOn Thursday, the Land Transport Authority announced additional measures to ensure social distancing on public transport networks to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore.This includes thermal scanners at select MRT stations and safe distancing stickers on buses, trains, train stations, bus interchanges and bus stops.READ: COVID-19: Additional safe distancing measures implemented on public transportThis came after heightened safe distancing measures kicked in on Tuesday as part of a ""circuit breaker"" period until May 4 to stem the spread of COVID-19.About 10,000 written advisories were issued on the first two days of the circuit breaker for breaches, including individuals who gathered in public and those who failed to adhere to safe distancing rules.People who repeatedly flout the stricter safe-distancing measures will face a fine or be charged in court, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli wrote on Facebook on Thursday.First-time offenders will get a stern written warning.

"Epidemiology studies how certain risk factors are associated with diseases and health outcomes. It is not saying that because these foreign workers are foreign workers so they have higher infection rates, and it is lower for locals. It is saying that there are certain characteristics in this sub-group of foreign workers living in dormitories that are associated with increased infections. We all know that. And that's exactly what the data says too. No bullshit here.

Now, given finite medical resources, how do we target the spread of covid? There is a need to evaluate groups with different risks (living environment, social norms) separately, and enforce various degrees of health measures based on different levels of risks. Why do we not count foreign workers as ""local community"" cases? They spend most of their time, guess where? The DORMS. Even if they head out, who do they hang with? Other foreign workers! Their level of infection risk is displayed differently from the average Singaporean, because IT IS.

In fact, this breakdown allows us to concentrate healthcare efforts in the dorms right now, and that is a GOOD thing because they do need it the most. A targeted approach is necessary for Singapore as a whole to combat covid.

Some first-steps I am guessing they will take: 

1) Regulate the number of beds/pax per room, with clearly specified spacing (e.g.: beds to  be 1m apart, bunk beds to be 2m apart etc.)  

2) To ensure privately catered lunches meet food safety standards, else caterers and employers will face a fine or more (I still have no idea how, with the timestamp requirement now, caterers are still allowed to drop off their breakfast and lunch at 7AM??)

"Do you work in a finance related field? Otherwise allow me to share some comments because I do and have been for a long time.

Despite what you may think, operating margin is still the most effective way of determining a company's financial health and credit profile. It is the number one thing which investors and creditors look to for most companies, since companies distribute their earnings to investors in the form of dividends and creditors get paid their due interests, all based on operating profits. You would need to have very special reasoning to substantiate the use of ROA from a financial analyst and also the company's directors perspectives. For example, an investment company which has the majority of its assets in share equity, cash and other financial assets, with very little operating expenses. Otherwise, operating profits is in almost all the cases the main determinant for the CEO's bonuses and salaries. From my understanding, I don't see any special reasoning to not use the OM to assess the company you mentioned and to also remunerate its executives for their work.

Next, there is depreciation of the properties owned by this company which would have been captured in the income statement and operating profit. For a company to be making so much profits in excess of its operating expenses and depreciation would sound off to me that the company must have derived some type of intangible benefit (such as being a first mover in an industry, or being in an industry with very low competition or strict regulations) since it has so highly valued its properties such that they are earning so much profits from it. This all the more supports the use of OM as it comprehensively captures the depreciation from the properties, as well as the operating expenses incurred from the financing, regular servicing and maintenance of such properties.

Lastly, you should probably be comparing its ratios (whether OM or ROA) over a longer period of time. I assumed you used the right formula for ROA which should be the average productive assets instead of whatever the simple figure is in the balance sheet as of the year. Comparing over time gives a better picture of whether the company is consistently making profits (in which case, I would wonder why are there not more companies going into this industry, if it is so profitable) or are there actually bad years for this company that is not observed by the public? Using ROA over time will also probably show you an increasing trend as assets get depreciated over time, so ROA would increase (notwithstanding that I think ROA is a bad indicator of performance).

Happy to hear your comments or counterpoints if any. Apologies in advance if this is overly harsh as any corporate financial analyst would tell you that ROA is typically seen as a fancy ratio cooked up by accountants which really doesn't serve any purpose or value when it comes to decision making at the very top of the company, and for the company's long term sustainability.",2020-06-17 05:03:47,reddit,work finance related field otherwise allow share comments long time despite may think operating margin still effective way determining company financial health credit profile number one thing investors creditors look companies since companies distribute earnings investors form dividends creditors get paid due interests based operating profits would need special reasoning substantiate use roa financial analyst also company directors perspectives example investment company majority assets share equity cash financial assets little operating expenses otherwise operating profits almost main determinant ceo bonuses salaries understanding see special reasoning not use om assess company mentioned also remunerate executives work next depreciation properties owned company would captured income statement operating profit company making much profits excess operating expenses depreciation would sound company must derived type intangible benefit first mover industry industry low competition strict regulations since highly valued properties earning much profits supports use om comprehensively captures depreciation properties well operating expenses incurred financing regular servicing maintenance properties lastly should probably comparing ratios whether om roa longer period time assumed used right formula roa should average productive assets instead whatever simple figure balance sheet year comparing time gives better picture whether company consistently making profits case would wonder not companies going industry profitable actually bad years company not observed public using roa time also probably show increasing trend assets get depreciated time roa would increase notwithstanding think roa bad indicator performance happy hear comments counterpoints apologies advance overly harsh corporate financial analyst would tell roa typically seen fancy ratio cooked accountants really doesn serve purpose value comes decision making top company company long term sustainability

My prediction is that the best case scenario means that WP means Aljunied and Hougang. That's it.

Forget about East Coast, East Coast has been redrawn such that more pro-PAP districts are included.

Worst case for opposition is that they win Hougang only. This is possible since WP got only 50.96% of the votes. Further, LTK is gone and a lot of WP support was for him. Most Chinese boomer voters cannot relate to Pritam. And the current Aljunied team has 3 non-chinese, and (right or wrong) some boomer voters will not accept this. Hence, PAP may with with 5-10% margin.

"I feel like the main gist of this article is to encourage the migrant workers to be more aware of personal hygiene or the government to help them become more acquainted with the process of personal hygiene. 

Of course, I see some people saying that they can't afford to clean when they're being worked to the bone, which I agree with that. However, if the conditions are to improve, but the habits that they used to live day to day don't, then the process is fruitless. 

The improvements in the conditions of migrant workers and the habits of their personal hygiene need each other for the cleanliness to be maintained.  Foreign workers work in different circumstances, and I do suppose the need of cleanliness is really emphasised when you're in close proximity to one another (as opposed to most Singaporeans who live in individual HDB flats). Singaporeans have the safety of their own quarters to avoid more spread of disease as compared to a cramped room (which hopefully should be resolved). 

Though I suppose there are some prejudices that the writer tends to have, such as the surface view that despite cleaners being hired, foreign workers don't clean up after themselves, and that they leave messes after parks (maybe some, but obviously not all), I think this was her main point. That they need the habit of cleanliness and a good environment to live in a clean environment, and that if those select few aren't trying to maintain their quarters, the rest will suffer.",2020-04-15 02:12:00,reddit,feel like main gist article encourage aware personal hygiene government help become acquainted process personal hygiene course see people saying afford clean worked bone agree however conditions improve habits used live day day process fruitless improvements conditions habits personal hygiene need cleanliness maintained work different circumstances suppose need cleanliness really emphasised close proximity one another opposed singaporeans live individual hdb flats singaporeans safety quarters avoid spread disease compared cramped room hopefully should resolved though suppose prejudices writer tends surface view despite cleaners hired clean leave messes parks maybe obviously not think main point need habit cleanliness good environment live clean environment select trying maintain quarters rest suffer

"I applaud Mr Cheng Shoong Tat for his letter ([Why foot the bill for dorm operators that have profited for years?](-foot-the-bill-for-dorm-operators-that-have-profited-for-years), May 16).

He is correct to question why taxpayers should foot the bill to clear up a mess the dormitory operators have profited from.

Singapore has always taken pride in being a beacon for global free enterprise. We are frequently reminded that our prosperity is based on a system of being open to business.

We have argued that our system works because it does not mollycoddle people amid the realities of the free market.

Our social assistance programmes are based on ""helping people to help themselves"".

We help people to retrain and reskill when they lose their jobs, rather than support them financially when they are not working.

📷

Why should a society that takes pride in not sheltering people from the realities of the free market system find it acceptable to shelter large corporations from the same?

The reality of the free market system is that it allows you to succeed with minimal government interference, but at the same time you are on your own if you fail.

The dormitory operators are not innovative start-ups coming up with market-disrupting products that will shape the future. They are not enterprises that hire many Singaporeans in high-paying jobs.

They make vast profits - Centurion Corp, for example, made $103.8 million on revenue of $133 million for the 12 months ended Dec 31 last year - merely by maximising the number of people in a certain space.

If our system allows them to earn profits in this manner, should we not also allow them to bear the cost when the system requires them to adapt their businesses to new realities?

"Is my English really that bad that everyone seems to be skirting around the main argument in favour of attacking a strawman argument where anyone who voices opposition is a hypocritical keyboard warrior?

Does no one have an issue with how the dormitory owners and construction industry seem to have largely gotten away scot-free? Over the years, they have made a small fortune by skimping on their living conditions. And these are not small companies barely breaking even. These are millionaires able to afford houses at Sentosa Cove, drive posh cars and otherwise lead lavish lifestyles. 

Meanwhile, when things go south, they don’t have to fork out a cent to clear up their shit. The government steps in to bail them out using taxpayer money, the opportunity cost of which is less resources to fund other social programmes for the betterment of society. And to add insult to injury, they still have the temerity to suggest that we foot the bulk of the added costs. 

Is this not akin to billing me for the bullet used to assassinate my loved one? 

My stance is, and always will be the same. I am willing to pay more, when I need to, for the betterment of society and the living standards of these foreign workers. I simply ask that the very people who have profited the most handsomely from their poor living conditions absorb the bulk of the costs, because they can, and because they should. 

Is that so unreasonable? 

If we want to look at the big picture, it’s that these companies are getting away with murder, and the government seems unable or unwilling to do anything to rein them in.

"SINGAPORE — Foreign workers have been in the authorities’ sight early on in the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore at the start of the year, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on Monday (4 May).Delivering a ministerial statement in Parliament, she explained how the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) helped to prevent imported cases by limiting the return of work pass holders and monitoring returnees’ compliance with Leaves of Absence and Stay-Home Notices, among other things.“Throughout this period, migrant workers were also on our radar,” said Teo.“Back in January, soon after the multi-ministry task force was set up, MOM reached out to dormitory operators to be more vigilant and to step up hygiene. In fact, one of the earliest media conferences that Minister Lawrence Wong and I held was at the Tuas View Dormitory, after we inspected their quarantine facilities in early February,” she said.Wong helms the National Development Ministry and co-chairs the Multi-Ministry Taskforce tackling the spread of the virus.Teo added, “We produced materials in the workers’ native languages to encourage them to take steps to protect themselves. Subsequently, non-essential facilities in the dormitories like gyms and TV rooms were closed. Meal-times and recreational hours were staggered. Intermixing between blocks was stopped.“MOM officers also fanned out on weekends, to advise migrant workers to observe safe distancing measures and disperse big groups that were gathering at popular hangouts.”‘Narrow focus on rooming arrangements may not prevent recurrence’In February, the authorities detected the first COVID-19 cluster involving migrant workers at a construction site at Seletar Aerospace Heights. The five workers stayed at five different locations, only two of which were dormitories, Teo noted.“Thereafter, there was no indication of higher prevalence of COVID-19 among migrant workers, compared to the general community,” she said.Several MPs had raised queries on the outbreak of COVID-19 in dormitories. Jurong GRC MP Ang Wei Neng asked, among other things, about the lessons to be drawn from the management of dormitories and if safe distancing can be “practically practised” in the existing purpose-built dormitories.Meanwhile, Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng asked if MOM would consider raising the minimum gross floor area of 4.5 square metres for each resident in a foreign workers' dormitory; and not including the basic living facilities - such as living quarters, kitchen, dining, and toilet areas - in the computation for the minimum gross floor area.Nominated MPs Walter Theseira and Anthea Ong also asked if a Committee of Inquiry would be appointed to probe the COVID-19 outbreak in the dormitories.Responding, Teo said epidemiological findings show that within the dormitories which have clusters, not all blocks or rooms are equally affected. And across the different dormitories, infected workers were linked via common work sites.“At the work sites, it was not uncommon for the infected workers to take breaks together, share food and utensils. Likewise, infected workers from different dormitories had gathered during their rest days to socialise and shop, for example at Mustafa. Back in the dormitories, workers spent time with their friends, cooking, eating and relaxing together,” said Teo.“The virus may have spread through all of these activities, much like how it spread among family members, religious groups and even colleagues,” she added.Teo also noted that most infected workers showed mild symptoms of the virus and that many cases were uncovered only due to active case-finding or swab-taking.“This may explain why up to the middle of March, the cases of workers at the dormitories testing positive were few and far between. Once evidence emerged that the virus had spread in the dormitories, we decided to deal with it squarely and quickly, and mobilise whole-of-government resources,” the minister said.She added, “Multiple channels of transmission among migrant workers, as appear to be the case, also means that we need a multi-faceted approach to dealing with the outbreak. A narrow focus on rooming arrangements may not prevent a recurrence. This consideration underpins the comprehensive approach of the Taskforce.”-19-m...083406682.html",2020-04-05 17:02:00,hardwarezone,singapore authorities sight early outbreak singapore start year said manpower minister josephine teo monday 4 may delivering ministerial statement parliament explained ministry manpower mom helped prevent imported limiting return work pass holders monitoring returnees compliance leaves absence stay home notices among things throughout period also radar said teo back january soon multi ministry task force set mom reached operators vigilant step hygiene fact one earliest media conferences minister lawrence wong held tuas view inspected quarantine facilities early february said wong helms national development ministry co chairs multi ministry taskforce tackling spread teo added produced materials native languages encourage take steps protect subsequently non essential facilities like gyms tv rooms closed meal times recreational hours staggered intermixing blocks stopped mom officers also fanned weekends advise observe safe distancing measures disperse big groups gathering popular hangouts narrow focus rooming arrangements may not prevent recurrence february authorities detected first cluster involving construction site seletar aerospace heights five stayed five different locations two teo noted thereafter no indication higher prevalence among compared general community said several mps raised queries outbreak jurong grc mp ang wei neng asked among things lessons drawn management safe distancing practically practised existing purpose built meanwhile nee soon grc mp louis ng asked mom would consider raising minimum gross floor area 4 5 square metres resident not including basic living facilities living quarters kitchen dining toilet areas computation minimum gross floor area nominated mps walter theseira anthea ong also asked committee inquiry would appointed probe outbreak responding teo said epidemiological findings show within clusters not blocks rooms equally affected across different infected linked via common work sites work sites not uncommon infected take breaks together share food utensils likewise infected different gathered rest days socialise shop example mustafa back spent time friends cooking eating relaxing together said teo may spread activities much like spread among family members religious groups even colleagues added teo also noted infected showed mild symptoms many uncovered due active case finding swab taking may explain middle march testing positive far evidence emerged spread decided deal squarely quickly mobilise whole government resources minister said added multiple channels transmission among appear case also means need multi faceted approach dealing outbreak narrow focus rooming arrangements may not prevent recurrence consideration underpins comprehensive approach taskforce 083406682 html

"Too difficult to test every resident for infection...I suggest to test on per household basis.Since residents in the same household are rikely to be in close proximity and masks are typically not worn indoors, then testing just one member per household works fine, and testing everyone in the household is only needed if one member is discovered to be infected.However even for that be viable, we will need to expand our testing capability by 10x per day to finish testing all households within 6-7 weeks in the best case scenario...And that ish just to test for infection, testing for resistance ish another thing all together.On top of that there ish this issue of ppl being required to run essential services and buying of supplies. Not exactly doable unless a full lockdown is implemented where everyone is required to stay at home and supplies are distributed.Earlier on there were discussion about segmenting SG into 4 regions for coordinated full lockdowns for testing/recovery. Was thinking about the issues involved and difficulty in enforcing movement and abuses. After checking out SG's map, I think it might be doable, though might not be in exactly 4 zones. There are still quite a large number of natural defensible choke points, which, if public transport services were being coordinated/controlled properly, human movement out of the zones could be enforced. The placement of the ""natural chokepoints"" almost seems strategically and deliberately placed.The major issue would be that the essential services workers might need to travel across entire island to work.

On 10 January, an expert group involving Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwanese technical experts and a World Health Organization team was invited to visit Wuhan. A set of nucleic acid primers and probes for PCR detection for COVID-19 was released on 21 JanuaryQuote:The Joint Mission consisted of 25 national and international experts from China, Germany, Japan, Korea, Nigeria, Russia, Singapore, the United States of America and the World Health Organization (WHO). The Joint Mission was headed by Dr Bruce Aylward of WHO and Dr Wannian Liang of the Peoples Republic of China. The full list of members and their affiliations is available in Annex A. The Joint Mission was implemented over a 9-day period from 16-24 February 2020. The schedule of work is available in Annex B.Quote:Asymptomatic infection has been reported, but the majority of the relatively rare cases who are asymptomatic on the date of identification/report went on to develop disease. The proportion of truly asymptomatic infections is unclear but appears to be relatively rare and does not appear to be a major driver of transmission.Quote:Specimens from both the upper respiratory tract (URT; nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and lower respiratory tract (LRT; expectorated sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage) are collected for COVID-19 testing by PCR. COVID-19 virus has been detected in respiratory, fecal and blood specimens. According to preliminary data from Guangzhou CDC as of 20 February, virus can initially be detected inupper respiratory samples 1-2 days prior to symptom onset and persist for 7-12 days in moderate cases and up to 2 weeks in severe cases. Viral RNA has been detected in feces in up to 30% of patients from day 5 following onset of symptoms and has been noted for up to 4-5 weeks in moderate cases. However, it is not clear whether this correlates with the presence of infectious virus. While live virus has been cultured from stool in some cases, the role of fecal-oral transmission is not yet well understood. COVID-19 has been isolated from the clinical specimens using human airway epithelial cells, Vero E6 and Huh-7 cell lines.Quote:Patients are discharged after clinical recovery (afebrile >3 days, resolution of symptoms and radiologic improvement) and 2 negative PCR tests taken 24 hours apart. Upon discharge, they are asked to minimise family and social contact and to wear a mask.

"You seem to be obsessed with the details, the balance sheet, and the allocation of money, which is not wrong, but you seem to miss the big picture.

The lesson we need to learn is this - in the real world, nothing is in black and white, and every thing we do has consequences. When you champion for a cause, regardless of whether you genuinely believe in it or just to virtue signal and make yourself look good, 
you must be prepared to pay the price. And usually, that 'price' would involve the whole of society.

And usually, that 'price' would involve us having to pay more from our pockets.

There are many people in r/Singapore that enjoy being judgemental and engage in virtue signaling to make themselves look good, without any thoughts of the consequences. These people need to take a good look at themselves in the mirror and think about what they are actually doing.",2020-05-16 12:16:26,reddit,seem obsessed details balance sheet allocation money not wrong seem miss big picture lesson need learn real world nothing black white every thing consequences champion cause regardless whether genuinely believe virtue signal make look good must prepared pay price usually price would involve whole society usually price would involve us pay pockets many people r singapore enjoy judgemental engage virtue signaling make look good without thoughts consequences people need take good look mirror think actually

"Govt pay = taxpayers pay what. Either way you are paying for it. 

And I honestly don’t think the govt was just ignoring the problem because they were lazy/ can’t be bothered. Rather, I think that the govt didn’t act on these calls for reform because citizens / taxpayers (wtv, same same) need to pay for it. 

And I don’t see any way around this, but money is really the solution to the problem. Mandate that workers need XXm2 amount of space, dorm operators charge out to developers, developers charge out to homeowners. You might say that uh, cant the developers just absorb the cost and cut profits. But that’s not how the market works right? And honestly, what can the government do about this? 

You might say that govt should pay, since they collect so much FW levy. But something has to go since govt has been using the FW levy to cross subsidise something else. So it’s either charge out to consumers or govt, i.e. taxpayers pay. 

And they decided that (as horrible as it is) they can get away with the living conditions as it is. Because on balance, that is better than making ppl pay more/raising taxes. honestly, most ppl didn’t care about FW pre-COVID.

"The foreign worker dormitory numbers will not dip for a while. Total size of the group is 300,000+. Let's assume 20% are positive. Since we can't test all of them at one go each day a group is tested and then the interest positive are reported. 

For example let's say you have a group of 300,000 people but only capacity to test 2000 a day. Let's say you then take the most likely infected (seriously symptomatic and need go hospital) and the ones closest to this group. Then slowly you go out to the less symptomatic and asymptomatic. We will keep seeing some number until they are all tested. Let's say we can do 5,000 a day in terms of test for dormitory this will take two months to go through the whole group.

The upside if this is that we'll get a pretty good picture of how many percent infected, how many percent asymptomatic, how many percent severe and need hospital and so on for a given age cohort. Besides doing hard labor for us they are also serving as a epidemiological study of covid.

"To compare NSF and FW seems a tad immature and short-sighted IMO. I'm not going to delve into army culture but expecting basic respect and decency from your employer and host is justified. Your comment has a bit of, ""Ah ok, but what about me???"" sentiment.

You state that it's hard to maintain and order when trying to implement measures on FW and that it is the more practical way to enforce measures but again, that doesn't mean it's right to do so. I'd even argue that you are making many assumptions about FW and are underestimating their capicity to understand. Fuck off with practicality la, again, they are NOT CATTLE. 

And how is your last paragraph about Singapore being 'the best place to be' in any way related to how they are being treated? Unrelated comment that seems to be justifying the callous treatment they are receiving. 

Look, in the end of the day, NSF and FW are from totally different socio-economic situations. NSF can go back home to their mummy/daddy/maid/girlfriend/boyfriend easily, FW don't have that luxury and have to juggle the pressure of sending back enough money back home to their families. Do try to have some empathy for them.

The ssme virus that devastated Wuhan and caused 40,000 doctors from all over China to be rushed in to treat patients there. Yet the same strain of virus only produced no symptoms or mild symptoms among our Foreign Worker population while else where it is overloading hospital systems to a point of chaos.The main deadly mechanism lf the disease is called the cytokine storm where the virus trigger the body immune system to overreact causing severe respiratory and organ failure.When you measure average temperature of Bangladeshi workers or Boston homeless it is 36.9-37 degrees. If you go and measure your own temperature it is likely 36.5-36.6 degrees....What is going on?Because of very hygenic environment the people in Western Europe have immune systems with threshold trottled down one symptom of that is lower body temperature which has been decreasing every decade. This is because kf hygenic and heavy use f cleaning fluids to keep environment germ free.When the body encounters the virus it overreacts like it sees an invading army....and fire too many weapons.But when a Bangladesh construction worker's body sees the same virus it is used to pathogens anx remain in a calm state.

"1. I've adequately answered in my other post why clustering was unavoidable. We can spew rhetorics about for 10,000 years about how you think tech could magically cut down the amount of foreign worker necessary by half so we suddenly only need to cram 6 instead of 12 to a room, but clustering was never an issue until today and it was necessary for the foreign workforce. The point being argued is that clustering was inhumane.

It isn't.

Now because of this virus, the seriousness of the issue got exposed world-wide and then suddenly the government *IS* open to change and betterment?

I understand that doing all these tests and well-being maintenance comes at a cost, but shouldn't that cost be bourne by both the government and greedy imbecilic fucks that caused this? Why suddenly float around this test balloon of seeking our understanding for the need to foot additional costs because of your years of negligence and can't be bothered attitude, coupled with the employers that abused and exploited these poor folks instead of picking up the ball and doing what's right, like starting from admitting that mistakes were made, taking responsibility for it and apologize, issue stiff punishment and penalties for those greedy retards involved and make laws that'll make sure that shit like this doesn't ever happen again, rather than putting on a great show for the entire world to see now and then neglecting them again when things go back to normal.

If asking us as a nation ""to be prepared to pay higher construction costs due to new covid-19 regulations.."" is the only course of action that you special 'multi-ministry-joint-task-force' can come up with right now, then u might as well straight up tell us to 'go fuck ourselves' better.

You also seem to forget that the virus can stay on some surfaces for 2-3 days.

You keep parroting about discrimination, while it’s not even something that is my point. All I have said is this kind of reporting is irresponsible and sets bad public expectations.

"Best case scenario is the spread is largely constrained to the dormitories and we follow a similar trajectory to South Korea, where the church cluster simply went out of hand but eventually went under control and the curve flattened drastically. Not sure how many % of our FWs are already tested, but the estimate of 10-20k FW cases in an article earlier might be reality. Hopefully the cases flatten out after that (because of our CB) and we gradually gain back control. CB I believe should be extended but some policies can be relaxed a bit if community spread is proven to still be low in early May, for instance social gathering of 2 people and opening of some more industries could be fine.

">Probably because more testing focused on dormitory and less on locals so not revealing the full situation.

Is there any reason you're thinking that the focus on testing has shifted to dorms (and hence the prime reason for drops in local transmission), apart from ""I don't think so based on the crowds I see?""

As far as I can tell, people who have displayed symptoms are still being tested. Which has been pretty much the policy for weeks, if not more than a month. That said, I'm not sure about the specific criterion for determining if you need a test (although I do know guidelines on treatments are being enforced more strictly).",2020-04-20 15:59:16,reddit,probably testing focused less locals not revealing full situation reason thinking focus testing shifted hence prime reason drops local transmission apart think based crowds see far tell people displayed symptoms still tested pretty much policy weeks not month said not sure specific criterion determining need test although know guidelines treatments enforced strictly

"I don’t think it’ll be anywhere near 53-47. In 2015, the margin was 68-32 (though granted a very strong PAP election). In 2011, Moulmein-Kallang GRC (which includes most of the current Jalan Besar), it was 59-41 even with an unpopular anchor minister Lui Tuck Yew. 

In any case I also think we may be overestimating the JoTeo effect. Unpopular opinion, but I honestly don’t think foreign workers would rank as even the top few issues for a lot of voters. This contrasts with Lui Tuck Yew’s Transport Ministry in 2011, which was the target of massive outrage due to the train breakdowns which materially affected voters’ lives.

"There are more than 40,000 Malaysians still in Singapore and the Malaysian state of Johor hopes that Singapore will make exemptions for them to be tested for Covid-19 before they are allowed to return to the state.More Malaysian workers are making their way back from Singapore after the Republic began implementing stricter measures to address the pandemic under a period known as the ""circuit breaker"". The measures which began on April 7 and will go on until May 4 have seen most workplaces and schools closed in order to reduce the risk of infections.Currently, Malaysians who test negative in Singapore will be able to go home and be quarantined there, while those without any certification or prior testing will be required to undergo compulsory 14-day quarantine at one of the government centres statewide.Johor Mentri Besar Hasni Mohammad said the state was working with the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the matter with their counterpart in Singapore given that the city-state presently does not conduct Covid-19 tests unless a person has showed symptoms.Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia Vanu Gopala Menon previously said there was currently no requirement by the Singapore government to provide random Covid-19 tests for foreign workers while Singapore's Ministry of Health has said that Covid-19 testing is only performed when clinically indicated, for patients and their close contacts.""That means a Malaysian can't get the test done in Singapore unless they are symptomatic, "" Datuk Hasni said in an interview in the Johor district of Iskandar Puteri.""We hope Singapore will allow for some exemptions so that Malaysians who want to return can get this test done at its clinics or hospitals, "" he said.Hasni said he was confident that the matter would be discussed through the Malaysia-Singapore Special Working Committee on Covid-19 for a solution to be reached.He said since Malaysia implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) on March 18 to curb the coronavirus, it has resolved certain issues, including easing the movement of cargo, essential and non-essential items between both countries as well as accommodation for Malaysian workers in Singapore.""The government will not stop Malaysians returning from Singapore and I can assure them that our frontliners have taken all the necessary steps and procedures at our border, "" he said.Hasni urged returning Malaysians to give their full cooperation to the frontliners conducting the necessary screening and testing at the checkpoints.On the number of Malaysians returning from Singapore after the island republic started its own measures to curb the spread of the virus, Hasni said the biggest influx was registered on April 3 with some 3,400 people.

"Good reporting by TODAY - ...-redhill-close-----The workers told this reporter that they moved in on Tuesday from Acacia Lodge at Bukit Batok and would have to be isolated for two weeks.During these two weeks, they would not be able to leave the cordoned area but food would be delivered to them three times a day.When asked what kind of food they have received, two foreign workers said it was Chinese food. Their meals contained rice, chicken and fruit, and they seemed satisfied with it.When asked whether the toilets were clean, the workers replied in the affirmative.The workers also seemed generally satisfied with their living conditions, saying all is okay...However, Singapore residents living around Redhill Close were a little concerned with the prospect of a large group of foreign workers living near them.Ms Jenny Mak, 52, pointed out that the estate has a relatively large elderly population, who might be more vulnerable to getting serious complications from Covid-19 infection.Ms Melissa Azmi, another resident in the estate, echoed similar sentiments, adding that she would have no issue if the foreign workers were kept behind the barricades.I have my grandfather at home and my mother. My son is three years old. Im just concerned. Even though they house healthy foreign workers here, we will never know right? said the 32-year-old, who works in the food and beverage sector.An elderly resident who gave his name as Mr Woo said he would have a peace of mind if there could be a way of guaranteeing that the foreign workers housed at Redhill Close are free from Covid-19. An example could be medical proof from the Singapore General Hospital, suggested the 82-year-old retiree.Im not saying they have the disease.

"""At the National Day Rally in 1971, about 40 years ago, the then Prime Minister, Mr Lee Kuan Yew spoke to the audience:But, mind you, there still has to be the road sweeper  the chap has got to collect your garbage. We have to mechanise because our young men, having been to school, they dont want to do that. So, we now have work-permit holders to do it. And after a while, there is a limit.You see the worksite  60 to 70 per cent are non-Singapore workers. They work harder, they take greater risks. What they earn here is two to three times what they earn in their own country. But we carry a social load. They dirty the place, they were not brought up in our schools, they litter. Its a problem.And if you take too many, then instead of our values being superimposed on them, they will bring us down to their values because its easier to be untidy, scruffy, dirty, anti-social than to be disciplined, well-behaved and a good citizen.*Then 8 years later, in the 1979 National Day Rally, Mr Lee Kuan Yew said again:Let me tell you the risks involved in carrying on as before. Last year, we had a record influx of work-permit holders, over 20,000. At this rate, we can safely and accurately forecast further input of 20,000, perhaps, 25,000 work-permit holders for 1980. In five years, you will have 120,000, in 10 years, a quarter million. Is it bearable?Maybe if they were from our traditional sources: with Malaysians there are minimal cultural and language problems. Last year, however, because there were not enough Malaysians, we started to move further afield and took work-permit holders from Thailand, from Sri Lanka, from India, from Bangladesh. They are good workers. They are hungry, they are lean, they are keen But I have a responsibility to you. In 10 years, can we digest so many?

"National Development Minister Lawrence Wong conceded that the safeguards against COVID-19 in foreign worker dormitories were not sufficient, according to a CNBC report on Wednesday (6 May), in the frankest admission yet by a Singapore leader that the government dropped the ball on the issue.In an interview with CNBCs Squawk Box Asia, the co-chair of the multi-ministry taskforce on the coronavirus was asked by anchor Sri Jegarajah why the government had failed to identify these dorms, which house some 400,000 men across Singapore, as a potential area of infection risk.Wong responded by pointing out that the foreign worker clusters have occurred not just in the dormitories, but also in common work sites and gathering areas.Jegarajah then pressed Wong, But do you accept that conditions in those foreign worker dormitories were frankly appalling, frankly unhygienic, and this was an accident waiting to happen from a public health point of view? And if so, are those conditions going to change?Wong replied that the living environment in the dorms has been steadily improving over the years, stressing that the real issue was that they were designed for communal living.Nevertheless, he said, I think the lesson we've learnt from this experience is that with this pandemic, the unprecedented pandemic, the safeguards were not sufficient, and the design of the dormitories have to change.

"As the global infection rate and death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic race upwards, people are playing the blame game, and it’s resulting in fraught relations and strained bilateral ties.Thanks to Lawrence Wong’s words, “hindsight” is now a word in popular usage. It’s easy for people to criticize their govts’ handling of the virus outbreak, but they have the wisdom of hindsight. And with hindsight, govts and their virus-fighting task force can now see there were alternatives and they would do things differently. What is easy to notice in hindsight was, alas, not at all obvious at the time. Everybody can be wise after the event.Those who have foresight are a rare breed while those who have the benefit of past experiences of virus outbreaks or have read a lot about them are plentiful. The former are foresighted, original thinkers who foresee warning signs and may come up with proactive steps to combat the coronavirus. The latter, with the advantage of hindsight, are able to dispense good advice, and I’ve seen plenty of such concerned, well-meant folks advising others to wear mask always, minimize social contact, avoid the crowds, dissolve crowded living conditions and so on and so forth. Their ideas were derived from previous epidemic experiences, thus they weren’t original.Mr Lawrence’s statement of “not having the luxury of the benefit of hindsight” is, to all intents and purposes, an admission of the authorities’ lack of foresight. Maybe the elected representatives of the people are somewhat good at governing the country, but when it comes to grappling with an unknown, invisible enemy that remains elusive and a real handful, they’re found wanting. It’s a difficult situation, when you think about it, fighting public enemy number one not on the battle field but by staying at home!

"""Cause if they do reopen, they are gonna get shit on"" - To be honest, there are certain things I can predict and certain things I can't. 

Things like relying on the biomedical/NCID expertise they've invested in etc - I thought they would but don't seem so. If keen, check out my profile for a comment where I summarised an infectious diseases control expert at NCID (speaking in personal capacity) who spoke at an online NUS Med webinar. There was quite a bit of evidence about asymptomatic transmission even back in Jan but Lawrence Wong said the govt only knew in April. So actions i thought were straightforward weren't taken. 

Other things I'd predicted (using POFMA but i didn't predict itd be abt Ho Ching's salary,  ploughing on with elections and not taking action earlier) came true.

 In short, anything to do with penalising the individual citizen was done swiftly. Anything to do with medicine wasn't. 

If it continues like this, then I'd say, they will reopen even if they get shit on.

I personally don't think they will lift the lockdown because there simply isn't enough healthcare resources.",2020-04-20 16:35:46,reddit,cause reopen gonna get shit honest certain things predict certain things things like relying biomedical ncid expertise invested etc thought would seem keen check profile comment summarised infectious diseases control expert ncid speaking personal capacity spoke online nus med webinar quite bit evidence asymptomatic transmission even back jan lawrence wong said govt knew april actions thought straightforward weren taken things predicted using pofma didn predict itd abt ho ching salary ploughing elections not taking action earlier came true short anything penalising individual citizen done swiftly anything medicine wasn continues like say reopen even get shit personally think lift lockdown simply enough healthcare resources

">**On Testing and COVID numbers**
 
>But, before we go to the second part of this COVID saga, let’s take a brief intermission and talk about COVID numbers. I think that it’s v important for our students to learn about how to look at numbers and make sense of numbers. We have a Quantitative Reasoning (QR) module at NUS. I hope the instructors covered this example in class already. 
 
>First, the numbers are all wrong. It was obvious that the numbers coming out of China were all wrong. China was accused of under-reporting and lying about the seriousness of the situation. In fact, the chart coming out of China was surprisingly linear. Confirm fake lah!
 
>Let me tell you this. If we look at the numbers coming out of the US, I can tell you almost certainty that the numbers are also under-reported. Confirm wrong. US also under-reporting and lying about their numbers? 
 
>So, what’s the moral of the story? Everybody lies? 
 
>As it turns out, there one big choke point that few people have talked about -- that’s testing. This COVID test is not some pregnancy test. You don’t happily go out to Watsons and buy one. Good for Korea for nailing this and really ramping up the tests. But most countries struggle, including us. 
 
>There are limits to how many tests can be conducted and processed. In fact, when we say that linear looking thing coming out of China, we were likely seeing the testing capacity rather than the actual number of cases. 
 
>So how do we make sense out of this lack of data? We look at the death rates. We take the country with the lowest death rate. I suspect it’s Singapore, but people can check. We’re at 0.075%. Basically out of every 10,000 infected, about 8 die. 
 
>Let’s look at the US. They claim to have 1.65 million cases. They currently have a death rate 6%. That’s a hundred times higher than Singapore(!).
 
>While we might believe that we have a better healthcare system in Singapore. Do we believe that we are 100x better? Not possible, so what we can do is to conservatively assume that their healthcare systems are overwhelmed and 2 to 3 times worse, so it might be reasonable to assume that their actual effective death rate should be say 0.2%. 
 
>What this suggests is that the situation in the US could potentially be 30x worse that what is officially reported. With the same approach, I had estimated the total number of cases in Wuhan was likely in the 300,000 range, when it was reported to be ~60,000. 
 
>The reader is encouraged to apply this simple methodology to get a sense of how bad things are in other countries. Generally, it’s probably /*much/* worse than what’s reported.

>**How and Why did Sh*t Hit the Fan?**
 
>It was all fine and dandy. We were all having our bubble tea, as the world went into chaos. Then what happened?
 
>The methodology I used above is not rocket science. It would also be obvious to the MTF that things were rapidly going south overseas. What did we do? 
 
>We activated MFA and started evacuating our people from overseas. All our students on exchanged were recalled. Many were complaining. 
 
>As it turned out, many of these returnees were infected and we were not able to control the second wave, leading to the Circuit Breaker. 
 
>Was it a mistake to evacuate them? 
 
>I am glad that nobody suggested that we made a mistake in recalling our citizens. My view: We had no choice. We need to take care of our own. 
 
>The bigger problem obviously are the foreign worker dorms. I am surprised that Dr Tan did not say anything about this and we went on and on this usual meaningless tirade against the Government that nobody probably cares to read. Nevermind, I do the job for him. 
 
>Let’s talk about the foreign worker dorms.
 
>We have always had these NGOs, activists, dunno what, clamoring about improving conditions in the dorms, whatever lah. Generally, my impression was that we just have bunch of bleeding hearts trying to do. Good for them. Good for us. I mind my own business.
 
>However, we now have this on-going narrative, that Government was completely at fault. If only the Government had listened to them and improved the conditions for the dorms, we wouldn’t have these massive numbers of infections in the dorms. 
 
>How many people believe this? Hands up. 
 
>Very good. Put your hand down. 
 
>Boys and girls, let talk about how to reason about this claim.
 
>Suppose the Government has just listened to these NGOs. Every single one of these foreigner workers had their own single rooms with attached bathroom and sauna. Best in Singapore and Batam also. We throw in a cleaning auntie to do area cleaning for them and do their laundry. Just imagine that. 
 
>Do we believe that it would have allowed us to avoid the current problem with the foreign worker dorms? 
 
>Obviously, this would increase social distancing and *maybe* help somewhat. But guess what? The workers will still be eating together and working together. Do people understand how infectious this virus is? Even healthcare workers in full PPE can still catch it. Confirm will still kenna. Who are we kidding?
 
>Keep in mind that we would not be requiring them to wear masks -- because our own people were not asked to wear masks then. You want to discriminate against these foreign workers? 
 
>My point: all these claims that acceding to the earlier demands of these NGOs and activists would have allowed us to avoid the current foreigner worker COVID situation is hogwash. Plain and simple. 
 
>Why are we misled into thinking that it would help? Because our brains are lazy. We want easy solutions. Part of it is also the Government’s fault. The Government didn’t offer us any reason for how and why the situation imploded in the dorm. Given the lack of an alternative, people just accept what is offered, hook, line and sinker. 
 
>I think it’s despicable for these groups to try to use this crisis to advance their lobbying. This is not the time. People also please don’t repeat stupid sh*t that you hear just because people say them. Use your brain to think about whether it makes sense. 

>There is a bunch of geniuses who say that if only we didn’t have any foreigner workers, there would not be any dorms and so there would be no foreign worker dorm problem. That statement is actually completely true. I shall leave it as an exercise for the reader to analyze the feasibility and helpfulness of that suggestion. 
 
>**Root Cause of Foreign Dorm Infections**
 
>Keep in mind that we actually did have one foreign worker dorm incident even in the first wave. That was settled with military precision. People think about it. You might know that the foreign worker dorms are a risk, but if you get a case and it was handled quite easily, you would naturally think that the risk was manageable. 
 
>My hypothesis is that the real root cause for the foreign dorm infections was the humongous number of asymptomatic cases. To be fair, we always had this suspicion that there could be a small number of asymptomatic carriers. That the proportion could be up to 96(!)% was not apparent until after we had imposed the CB. By then, it was too late. 
 
>Why is it so hard for us and anyone to detect this earlier? Well, for the simple reason that there was a limited testing capacity. 
 
>If you had to choose who to test, would you choose the ones who look sick or the ones who look perfectly normal. This massive problem was likely detected when one dorm got hit and they did systematic testing in the dorms.
 
>Maybe some people expect a Government that is more omniscient. They certainly have the option to vote in a more omniscient Government at the next GE. Our Tans seem to be pretty omniscient.  :-)
 
>Personally, I would be more circumspect and forgiving about the challenges of dealing with this enemy unseen.",2020-05-25 12:47:28,reddit,testing numbers go second part saga let take brief intermission talk numbers think v important students learn look numbers make sense numbers quantitative reasoning qr module nus hope instructors covered example class already first numbers wrong obvious numbers coming china wrong china accused reporting lying seriousness situation fact chart coming china surprisingly linear confirm fake let tell look numbers coming us tell almost certainty numbers also reported confirm wrong us also reporting lying numbers moral story everybody lies turns one big choke point people talked testing test not pregnancy test happily go watsons buy one good korea nailing really ramping tests countries struggle including us limits many tests conducted processed fact say linear looking thing coming china likely seeing testing capacity rather actual number make sense lack data look death rates take country lowest death rate suspect singapore people check 0 075 basically every 10 000 infected 8 die let look us claim 1 65 million currently death rate 6 hundred times higher singapore might believe better healthcare system singapore believe 100x better not possible conservatively assume healthcare systems overwhelmed 2 3 times worse might reasonable assume actual effective death rate should say 0 2 suggests situation us could potentially 30x worse officially reported approach estimated total number wuhan likely 300 000 range reported 60 000 reader encouraged apply simple methodology get sense bad things countries generally probably much worse reported sh hit fan fine dandy bubble tea world went chaos happened methodology used not rocket science would also obvious mtf things rapidly going south overseas activated mfa started evacuating people overseas students exchanged recalled many complaining turned many returnees infected not able control second wave leading circuit breaker mistake evacuate glad nobody suggested made mistake recalling citizens view no choice need take care bigger problem obviously surprised dr tan not say anything went usual meaningless tirade against government nobody probably cares read nevermind job let talk always ngos activists dunno clamoring improving conditions whatever generally impression bunch bleeding hearts trying good good us mind business however going narrative government completely fault government listened improved conditions wouldn massive numbers infections many people believe hands good put hand boys girls let talk reason claim suppose government listened ngos every single one foreigner single rooms attached bathroom sauna best singapore batam also throw cleaning auntie area cleaning laundry imagine believe would allowed us avoid current problem obviously would increase social distancing maybe help somewhat guess still eating together working together people understand infectious even healthcare full ppe still catch confirm still kenna kidding keep mind would not requiring wear masks people not asked wear masks want discriminate against point claims acceding earlier demands ngos activists would allowed us avoid current foreigner situation hogwash plain simple misled thinking would help brains lazy want easy solutions part also government fault government didn offer us reason situation imploded given lack alternative people accept offered hook line sinker think despicable groups try use crisis advance lobbying not time people also please repeat stupid sh hear people say use brain think whether makes sense bunch geniuses say didn foreigner would not would no problem statement actually completely true shall leave exercise reader analyze feasibility helpfulness suggestion root cause infections keep mind actually one incident even first wave settled military precision people think might know risk get case handled quite easily would naturally think risk manageable hypothesis real root cause infections humongous number asymptomatic fair always suspicion could small number asymptomatic carriers proportion could 96 not apparent imposed cb late hard us anyone detect earlier well simple reason limited testing capacity choose test would choose ones look sick ones look perfectly normal massive problem likely detected one got hit systematic testing maybe people expect government omniscient certainly option vote omniscient government next ge tans seem pretty omniscient personally would circumspect forgiving challenges dealing enemy unseen

"Why the PAP has failed14 Feb - there was a foreign worker tested positive for COVID-19 and he was rushed into ICU a day later. 17 Feb - 2 more foreign workers were tested positive for the virus. 18 Feb - it was revealed that they formed a new cluster from a work site.News came out and employers rushed to send their foreign workers, who are unwell, to the hospital for a swab test.19 Feb - MOM published a news article from Mr Kelvin Teoh (divisional director of MOM for foreign workers) that employers must not send the foreign workers to the hospital or they may have their WORK PASS privileges suspended. Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet. The poor foreign workers in numbers of 300,000 became victims of the PAP government, due to their lack of hindsight and that huge stench of arrogance to listen to the public when many threads about the issue was raised in and around mid Feb.

"A forum letter published in Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao that links the COVID-19 outbreak in dormitories to the personal hygiene and living habits of foreign workers shows ""underlying racism"", Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said.""I think the letter reveals some underlying racism ... Because it typecasts an entire group - several hundred thousand of them - as lacking in personal hygiene, on the basis of their background, because they all come from backward countries,"" he said in an interview with Lianhe Zaobao on Friday (Apr 17).Mr Shanmugam also said that the letter is xenophobic and deeply insensitive, and reflected a ""lack of understanding of why we have this transmission of COVID-19 amongst our foreign worker population"".Singapore has seen a spike in its number of COVID-19 cases in recent weeks, with the majority of new cases involving foreign workers from dormitories.On Friday, Singapore reported 623 new infections, of which 558 were linked to foreign worker dormitories.Kranji Lodge 1 on Saturday became the 13th foreign worker dormitory to be gazetted an isolation area, meaning residents will have to be quarantined in their rooms.To date, more than 3,200 of Singapore's 5,050 cases are attributed to foreign worker domitories.The forum letter, published on Apr 13, questioned if foreign workers were to be blamed for the rise in cases, pointing to their eating habits and alleged lack of personal hygiene.Mr Shanmugam, however, said that the number of cases at foreign worker dormitories were primarily due to communal living, pointing out that foreign workers live, work and cook together.""Personal habits are extremely important  washing of hands, keeping yourself clean are very important,"" he said.""But when you put people together, when they sleep in the same room, they cook together and they are in close proximity over a long period of time, of course there will be high levels of transmission.""Mr Shanmugam also acknowledged concerns over the living conditions in dormitories, saying that conditions in the newer dormitories were ""quite okay"", while standards in the older ones varied.""As (Manpower) Minister Josephine Teo has said, look, we will fix this up after COVID-19, and we will deal with the older dorms,"" he said.With foreign worker cases expected to continue rising amid aggressive testing, Mr Shanmugam said there is a need to educate people on the reasons.""The circulation is limited, they are in community isolation,"" he said.""The cross-infection from that person to the rest of the community, whether Singaporean or PR, or foreign worker, is extremely minimised through our isolation approaches.""Some people have also expressed concern that foreign domestic workers, because of potential interaction with foreign workers on their days off, could be another group at risk of being infected in large numbers.Current data shows that infection among foreign domestic workers is very low, said Mr Shanmugam.Foreign domestic workers have to comply with circuit breaker measures and must remain in their employers' homes on their rest days.""The evidence so far is that they get the infection from their employers, not from outside,"" he added.Looking at the bigger picture, Mr Shanmugam said Singaporeans have a duty to care for foreign workers and show them empathy, adding that the Government and community have moved to help them.Fifty-seven per cent of Singaporeans have been able to become professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMET) because of foreign workers, he said.""They clean Singapore, they build our HDB flats, they build our buildings, they handle our waste management, they form the base of our economy,"" he added.""And therefore they are helping us build our prosperity.""Mr Shanmugam cautioned Singaporeans against making sweeping statements about foreign workers, even as he acknowledged that racial fault lines run deep.""As Singaporeans, I would say, whether Chinese, Indian or Malay, or Eurasians, others, we are really kind, compassionate, generous people,"" he stated.""We are bigger than the sentiments expressed in that letter.""-12654924Why no story about throwing away food?

"Came here to say, this will not help and it’s such a terrible decision.  
  
I know our Frontlines in charge of Covid containment is overwhelmed with work but this has to be said:  

**Edit: ignore the first 3 points. Cruise for recovered FW.**  
1.They will do swap test first on those being relocated to these cruise- **but tests are known to have turn out negative initially** so they can still be infected.
   
2.These FW aren’t fully quarantined, **they are still going to work**.  
(Another concern, are we asking FW to continue wearing mask throughout work? again, if not then it’ll obviously be more likely to spread Covid. Perhaps their work already requires them to wear a mask idk.. I’ll just point this out so anyone in the know can work it out so no FW faints doing  labour work because of a suffocating mask whole day.)
   
3. Bad publicity worldwide. Once an outbreak occurs on this cruise(unless it’s contained very well, which is just betting ur luck.)
   
4. We should be applying lockdown for all FW living in crowded/shared dorm for at least 14days to make sure our healthcare doesn’t get strained more.
   
5. Imo, It makes no sense to let our FW continue work during this CB and Dormitory spike. We should solve the crowded dorm issues first, since we currently have community spread going on we shouldn’t react as if FW bringing Covid back to temporary dorm or causing further spread in community isn’t likely. 
   
My suggestion: I don’t know the capacity our country can do to house as many of them separately. But if surveillance is an issue, we can make mid shift shelters and get general public to help monitor via camera(we report to authorities if anyone try to sneak out) hopefully this will help slow the spread and we can get some breather for our frontlines.  
(For the sake of everyone, We will have to endure and work together if rubbish and cleaning or other essentials done by FW is disrupted.)
   
Before *you* start flaming aimlessly. Lockdown and surveillance means, **temporary** build a fenced shelter/tents for few weeks so the dormitory issues doesn’t turn tragic(we will only monitor the fences to make sure no one flout).

Edit: just realised it was for recovered FW, heard on TV and saw the comments hence I didn’t check the article first sorry. But some of my points can be considered.

This is confusing though:

Three of the latest cases announced are imported. 314 cases have been discharged from acute care, and 705 cases have been moved to a community isolation facility, the task force said. Singapore has also seen six fatalities from COVID-19, the task force said. It was reported on Wednesday a 32-year-old Indian national died after taking a swab test, and was confirmed to have COVID-19 after his death.READ: Day 2 of COVID-19 'circuit breaker' sees more than 3,000 breaches of safe distancing measuresAdvertisementThe task force said that with the help of the police and Ministry of Defence, it established a link between the  cluster at Mustafa Centre shopping mall and the Project Glory construction site as well as a number of foreign worker dormitories: S11 Dormitory@Punggol, Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tampines Dormitory Cochrane Lodge II  and Toh Guan Dormitory. Director of medical services at the Ministry of Health Assoc Prof Kenneth Mak described how some of the dormitory cases were linked to the Mustafa Centre cluster.""We believe that the workers had visited Mustafa and they subsequently transmitted the infection to their co-workers,"" he said.  ""Transmission most likely occurred through close contact,for example at meal times, during breaks, and also between co-workers at work due to physical proximity at work sites,"" he said.Subsequently, they could have spread the infection to colleagues and friends within the dormitories, he added. Singapore has seen a rise of COVID-19 cases at foreign worker domitories recently.Sungei Tengah Lodge became the fourth foreign worker dormitory to become an isolation area from midnight on Thursday, in a move aimed at preventing the spread of the disease.The other three dormitores that have been gazetted as isolation areas are: S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, Westlite Toh Guan dormitory and Toh Guan Dormitory.READ: COVID-19: Sungei Tengah Lodge declared an isolation area under Infectious Diseases ActOn Thursday, the Land Transport Authority announced additional measures to ensure social distancing on public transport networks to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore.This includes thermal scanners at select MRT stations and safe distancing stickers on buses, trains, train stations, bus interchanges and bus stops.READ: COVID-19: Additional safe distancing measures implemented on public transportThis came after heightened safe distancing measures kicked in on Tuesday as part of a ""circuit breaker"" period until May 4 to stem the spread of COVID-19.About 10,000 written advisories were issued on the first two days of the circuit breaker for breaches, including individuals who gathered in public and those who failed to adhere to safe distancing rules.People who repeatedly flout the stricter safe-distancing measures will face a fine or be charged in court, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli wrote on Facebook on Thursday.First-time offenders will get a stern written warning.

"> # COVID-19: Singapore confirms 533 new cases, total at 32,876

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 533 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Wednesday (27 May) noon, bringing the total to 32,876.

> Of them, the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories, said the ministry, while three remaining cases are Singaporeans or permanent residents.

> It added that more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of over 2,500 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tuas View Dormitory and Jurong Penjuru Dormitory.

> They are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some 400,000 foreign workers live in dorms here in Singapore.

> Some 20,000 infected foreign workers are expected to be discharged by the end of this month, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong at a press conference on 12 May.

> This story will be updated later.

> MOH’S STATEMENT IN FULL

> With 706 more cases of COVID-19 infection discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, a total of 16,444 cases here have fully recovered from the infection, said the MOH on Tuesday.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while eight are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Apart from 23 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, nine others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and two whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> It had also noted that 86 male foreign workers aged 25 to 59 died due to heart disease in Singapore in 2018.

> As of 25 May, the ministry has conducted 334,691 swab tests, of which 218,996 were done on unique individuals.

> This translates to around 58,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 38,400 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

"Foreign worker dormitory is basically BMT army dormitory. A couple if not more bunk beds in a room, depending on room size with shared living area.

They aren't living in inhuman conditions. I doubt they will be fined except for if safe distancing law applies to the dorm supervisors. The place where I can see fines being imposed are just that, and failure to upkeep hygiene standards by supervisors. I've heard about electrical issues as well. HUGE FINES like people are hoping for probably won't happen.

If it all adds up it might be substantial, but nothing big enough to invoke waves of change. Stricter supervision will become a thing, but I doubt they will suddenly be living in better homes. While living conditions were not stellar, they were livable. There were no major issues prior to Covid. So the majority of this outrage is stemming from *distancing issues.*

In case the economics have failed the majority of Reddit, the biggest problem that plagued most people in Singapore financially is housing, before this Covid crisis. This is a problem of landspace. 100 HDB flats isn't suddenly going to appear out of no where, and 6 fully grown adults in one flat isn't exactly a huge step up. The biggest improvements here will be not having to bath with everyone. But that doesn't solve much does it? We would need 200-300 HDB flats to really allow safe distancing permanently. That's 200-300 high rise 40 floors hdb. 

Anyone has any idea where you wanna build 100-300 high rise HDB in Singapore to solve safe distancing for foreign workers permanently? Do the math yourself, there are roughly 300k foreign construction workers in Singapore at any one time. 

Or, you know, we could make foreign workers live in coffin homes like in Hong Kong. Way more inhuman IMO, but hey, safe distancing and privacy won't be an issue there. Perfect for dealing with covid, agreed?

If anyone of you can solve these issues, and compile the math and financial budget required for any minister to undertake this task, be my guest. I'd love to see these workers living in good condition too. But personally I think it's a more concrete issue of budget than a philosophical issue of discrimination and lack of care.",2020-04-14 06:27:50,reddit,basically bmt army couple not bunk beds room depending room size shared living area living inhuman conditions doubt fined except safe distancing law applies supervisors place see fines imposed failure upkeep hygiene standards supervisors heard electrical issues well huge fines like people hoping probably won happen adds might substantial nothing big enough invoke waves change stricter supervision become thing doubt suddenly living better homes living conditions not stellar livable no major issues prior majority outrage stemming distancing issues case economics failed majority reddit biggest problem plagued people singapore financially housing crisis problem landspace 100 hdb flats suddenly going appear no 6 fully grown adults one flat exactly huge step biggest improvements not bath everyone doesn solve much would need 200 300 hdb flats really allow safe distancing permanently 200 300 high rise 40 floors hdb anyone idea wanna build 100 300 high rise hdb singapore solve safe distancing permanently math roughly 300k construction singapore one time know could make live coffin homes like hong kong way inhuman imo hey safe distancing privacy won issue perfect dealing agreed anyone solve issues compile math financial budget required minister undertake task guest love see living good condition personally think concrete issue budget philosophical issue discrimination lack care

Edit 2: from my reply below:

> the recently abandoned precinct near my place due to en bloc is now being refitted with many new facilities, with rumors that it will be a quarantine/SHN center. There’s absolutely no news about that, but residents are seeing the work done and the urgency of speed that it’s done at, it’s not hard to put two and two together.  

Well, the notice just came up today, the blocks were being refitted with basic amenities like lighting and bedding, and it’s to house the foreign workers from the dorms so that they won’t be so cramped up together. They’ve been physically working at this for at least 2 weeks, you can only imagine the logistics and planning that needed to make this happen to go further back beyond that. 

See? I told you, they government _was_ doing something but as usual they do it quietly and don’t announce it until things are more or less underway - it’s their usual practice but as usual we only react to what we know because it’s soooo much easier to stand from where we are after everything has happened and criticize every single bit they’ve done than try to understand their plans. 

Edit: Okay, I get it. The signs have been there. But in crisis mode, to the benefit of the govt there’s many other areas they need to look at too. It wouldn’t be fair to say the government didn’t do anything when they have been doing everything they can for the whole country.

For the Sentosa reference, I think this was a really great misdirection by TOC - they wrote [an article](/) suggesting (but not saying) Han earns enough money from his involvement in foreign worker dorms to support the Sentosa home. But (a) the TOC article says that Sentosa home was built in 2012 (b) Han only joined Centurion Corp in [2015](-us/board-of-directors/) and (c) OP's post points out that Han earned $46,000 in 2019. This is per annum.

Similarly to BMT, you're not paid to clean the bunk. You're paid to be a soldier, and taking care of fellow soldiers and discipline feeds into that. 

If you were to turn up at work dirty, smelly, with no care for your working environment and always falling sick but you still did you work, ok, sure you're no  NOT doing ypur work but you can be sure your employer will say something abt that? 

I can also say shit i have to do chores when i come home. Thats unpaid labor so I dont do. Wtf kind of thinking is that? 

Just now you said if renter dont mantain the place of the landlord can take their deposit- then that implies that they have some responsibility , no? Is this also not 'unpaid labour' on the renters part, except that here there is a tacit penalty to encourage that?

Again, no 1 is asking the..to clean toilet or take out the trash or clean the whole damn place- these are already settled by the dorm what I'm talking of is basic care for the environment.

"> # Coronavirus: 21 vacant HDB blocks in Bukit Merah being refurbished to house essential foreign workers

> SINGAPORE - Some 21 vacant Housing Board blocks in Bukit Merah are being refurbished to house healthy foreign workers working in essential services, the Ministry of National Development (MND) has said.

> The workers will start to move into the three-room flats progressively as works are completed in the coming weeks.

> MND said in response to queries from The Straits Times on Wednesday (April 8) that the affected blocks had earlier undergone the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme, which buys back from residents public housing sitting on land with high redevelopment potential for other purposes.

> The flats were vacated in 2018 but not yet demolished.

> With foreign dormitories becoming a source of concern for the spread of the coronavirus in recent days, an inter-agency task force has been set up to, among other things, ensure that any disruption to essential services is minimised by having workers in these industries housed separately.

> The foreign workers who are expected to move into the Redhill Close flats work in areas such as cleaning and maintenance.

> In a notice to residents in the area on Monday, Minister of State for Social and Family Development Sam Tan said that the dormitories of the workers slated to move in have not been spared from Covid-19.

> Housing them separately will ""keep them safe from the disease, which will in turn keep us safe when they are working in our midst"", said Mr Tan, who is also Minister of State for Foreign Affairs.

> He also assured residents that just like the rest of Singapore during the ""circuit breaker"" measures, which began on Tuesday, the workers will remain in their flats except to travel to work using company transport or to buy essentials.

> Police and Certis officers will be deployed to maintain order at these blocks.

> ""Let's show our support to these workers by welcoming them during this difficult period,"" he added.

> The Straits Times has contacted MND for more information.

"In my original post, the point was giving them more space per room in a realistic scenario, which should be done by the way, *would not have prevented a dormitory cluster.*

Your point here is army dorm is more livable compared to fw dormitory. I cannot dispute this, you seem to know more details about the condition. I never said my post was infallible. So let's take this as it is. We reduce 1/5 men from every room that's really cramped and expand the dormitory. It's a realistic scenario. Fuck cost cutting. 
We can make it more livable.

Everyone gets more breathable living space.

Would that have changed anything about covid outbreak?

Maybe instead of averaging 1000 we'd get about 800~. Given that they would still share the same eating/cleaning space regardless I wonder how true that would be. I don't have expertise on the exact math of spread to build a model here.

There were no realistic scenario where we are able to give them enough privacy per person to prevent an outbreak. 

TL;DR this isn't exactly the right or wrong conversation for my post. People are mistaken about something, if they want better living conditions for FW, sure. I stand by the point it's not inhumane living condition, but it's also not ideal. 

If they are using covid as an argument for better living conditions, no, it would not have prevented dormitory clusters on the whole.

If you want to push the agenda for better living condition with the argument of minimizing the impact of covid outbreak though, I got nothing, full steam ahead. This was a compromise I left open in my original argument that no one took up because they were too busy trying to pin the entire FW dormitory outbreak on the corporations.

IMO the people who disagreed with my previous post were idealistic pussies who can't come up with a compromise themselves anyway. I have nothing against actual solutions. When you want to submit proposal of any kind in the working world you need concrete research. 

I personally have nothing against wanting better living conditions contrary to what my post might seem like on the first glance. I never stated it's impossible to improve living conditions, nor that there were no negligence.

"At some point, the health ministry will stop moving out those who test positive, based on the educated suspicion that there will be more infected people than not. That's only simply because there is no manpower nor space to monitor tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of sick people.

To always keep things in context, covid is a very mild illness in the vast majority of people. We're experiencing manpower shortfalls in healthcare because of the (very justified) policy in isolating every person who tests positive - this is a vast manpower undertaking. But at some point - this policy will prove a logistical impossibility and will therefore be stopped. Anyone who falls very ill can then be transported to a healthcare facility, but otherwise, sick people will largely be left to their own devices.

With regard to long-term policies? A fact-finding committee should be set in place with the power to issue criminal charges. There must be an investigation into the practices of these dormitory operators, the actions (or lack thereof) of the political leadership, and if there has been undue influence of these shady businesses in the workings of our government. But that's not going to happen, of course.

The political leadership for too long has dallied on much-belated policies - it has been sitting on its arse for far too long leeching on the high-level of competence of the state bureaucracy. It's long-past time for them to tell local businesses to front up or shut up and stop crying about 'manpower shortages' because they don't want to pay living wages or invest in productivity automation.

"Ok maybe I used the wrong word. Obviously I am not decrying the culture of ethnicities, but rather the environment they grew up in. Even then, do you really not think cultures can have an impact on characteristics? If I were to pick a chinese who grew up in california versus a chinese who grew up in beijing, chances are the one in california would be more liberal and outgoing wouldn’t it? Simply because the society in california is more open minded than that of beijing. 

Here’s another analogy. Would you rather have your son/daughter date a black who grew up in a community where gang wars, rape, robbery, assault is the norm or one who grew up in a safer community?

You have never met either of them and that’s the only information you know. Statistically and logically you would go with the second choice wouldn’t you? Maybe the first guy is a saint and the second guy is a psychopath but the chances of this is low. 

Racism is a huge problem, but I think hypocritically denigrating people for racism is also a problem. The analogy I raised above is basic human instinct 101, but more and more people are just hiding these thoughts for the fear of being called a racist. I don’t think that’s nice because its pretty oppressive.

"Actually, in first world countries, minimum wage are not given, and most do not have it. Although it seems good on the surface as some argue that it helps balance disparity between wages and reduces poverty level, it may not be entirely true.

Minimum wage is the least an employer can legally pay a worker. This may cause employers to raise standards (3 year work experience only, graduates in related field only, etc) that may not justify the wage to be paid. In the short term view, people may lose jobs/opportunities to get jobs. People who are willing to get paid less to do the same work in order to get paid cannot legally do so, and people who get the job are often over qualified and overworked.

The problem with dorms in sg is more of how they are set up, rather than their existence. If set up well and maintained, it would function like a housing grant (or properties) provided by certain companies offer. I think in Europe's context it also depends where in Europe you are looking at, but it is also in part due to their comparatively low (and long term) rental rates that you don't see such dorms around.",2020-04-22 02:09:07,reddit,actually first world countries minimum wage not given not although seems good surface argue helps balance disparity wages reduces poverty level may not entirely true minimum wage least employer legally pay may cause employers raise standards 3 year work experience graduates related field etc may not justify wage paid short term view people may lose jobs opportunities get jobs people willing get paid less work order get paid cannot legally people get job often qualified overworked problem sg set rather existence set well maintained would function like housing grant properties provided certain companies offer think europe context also depends europe looking also part due comparatively low long term rental rates see around

"> # New dorm standards good for workers but will come with inevitable cost hike: Dorm operators

> SINGAPORE - New standards for migrant worker dormitories will enhance workers' well-being, said dormitory operators here, but will come with a cost increase of at least 50 per cent to implement them in existing dorms.

> Under new specifications announced by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Monday (June 1), dorms will have no more than 10 beds per room, with only single-deck beds and 1m spacing between them. Each room now holds 12 to 16 beds.

> In recent weeks, the living conditions of foreign workers in dormitories have come under scrutiny as workers account for more than 90 per cent of Covid-19 cases here.

> Each resident will enjoy 6 sq m of living space, not including shared facilities, compared with 4.5 sq m now, which includes shared facilities. Not more than five people will share a toilet, bathroom and sink, compared with 15 people currently.

> As a result, costs will increase significantly on all fronts, said dorm operators, with most agreeing on at least 50 per cent.

> Mr Calvin Lim, general manager of CDPL (Tuas) Dormitory, said building costs could even double, depending on factors such as the dorm's remaining lease-term and its tenancy agreements with employers.

> ""If all things stayed constant and we just reduced double-deck beds to single beds, the cost per bed could already be doubled. And that's excluding the other changes and the additional operational costs that are bound to increase over time,"" he said.

> President of the Dormitory Association of Singapore Johnathan Cheah expects building costs to double, along with a 50 per cent increase in operating costs. These should be shared by employers, dorm operators and the Government, he said.

> ""Dorm operations might well be a 24/7 feature in future as more manpower would be needed to implement the measures, such as stepping up on housekeeping,"" he said.

> Related Story New standards to be piloted at upcoming Quick Build Dorms

> Related Story Most residents understand why workers moved to estates: MPs

> Centurion chief executive Kong Chee Min agreed that building costs will make the bulk of the cost increase, though he did not specify by how much.

> He said existing and interested new operators have to consider the cost of development and operations as well as the revenue potential in the open market, to assess the viability of the business.

> He said: ""There'll be a continued need for migrant worker housing and purpose-built dormitories will continue to be the best solution to address such housing needs in land-scarce Singapore.""

> The new specifications will be piloted at upcoming Quick Build Dormitories, short- to medium-term housing to house around 25,000 workers. These semi-permanent structures will be ready by the end of this year and will last for about two to three years.

> The Straits Times understands that new and existing operators are likely to be invited to run these upcoming dorms, although the authorities have yet to detail licensing and cost arrangements.

> Another 11 purpose-built dorms to house up to 100,000 workers are in the works and are expected to be ready in the next two years.

> Mr Jack Ng, facilities manager of Hulett Dormitory, said he will look at upgrading his 1,200-bed factory converted dormitory at Senoko Drive after some workers can be rehoused in the Quick Build Dormitories.

> Related Story Embracing dignity of work and workers

> Related Story Why Singapore cannot cut down on foreign workers the way other countries have

> Related Story Racism and xenophobia resurfacing during Covid-19: MCCY minister Grace Fu

> He added that Hulett Dormitory, which charges $280 per worker per month, has no plans to increase its prices at the moment as it is focused on getting the dorm a cleared status from MOM so workers can resume work.

> Dr Harvey Neo, programme head at the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, said the new guidelines are a ""significant improvement"" as they distinguish between different living spaces and reduce density in the dorms.

> Regardless of how the cost is distributed among the various stakeholders, Dr Neo said it should not filter down to the foreign workers as there is ""no compelling reason"" to do so.

> Mr Lee Chew Chiat, government and public services industry leader at Deloitte South-east Asia, said while the cost hike is inevitable, it is worth considering what the alternative cost would be without these new measures in time of pandemics such as Covid-19.

> He said: ""The fundamental question should be why do we need these new measures? If we are doing it for the right reasons, then it's wise to implement them and then work to increase the benefit over cost.""

"To quote Yong Han Poh in her facebook post (that was well written and linked to two other interesting opinions on this matter which I unfortunately can't link to because this subreddit doesn't allow for Facebook links):

""I don’t agree with many things in Dr. Tan’s post, but that doesn’t mean I fully agree with Dr. Leong’s post either.

On the first two points, yes, I understand that there are numerous policy considerations and the apparent “U-turn” came because of a mix of changing epidemiology and strategic / security concerns relating to mask supply and so forth. Like Dr. Leong, I don’t blame the government for revising their policies given changing circumstances. I also think we have remarkable testing capacity, and I don’t doubt that many contingency plans have been put in place to avoid over-straining our healthcare system. On these fronts, I applaud the government.

It’s really his third point that I want to critique. Dr. Leong says that his ""hypothesis is that the real root cause for the foreign dorm infections was the humongous number of asymptomatic cases.” He even throws in a thought experiment: “Suppose the Government has just listened to these NGOs. Every single one of these foreigner workers had their own single rooms with attached bathroom and sauna. Best in Singapore and Batam also. We throw in a cleaning auntie to do area cleaning for them and do their laundry. Just imagine that. Do we believe that it would have allowed us to avoid the current problem with the foreign worker dorms? Obviously, this would increase social distancing and *maybe* help somewhat. But guess what? The workers will still be eating together and working together. Do people understand how infectious this virus is? Even healthcare workers in full PPE can still catch it. Confirm will still kenna. Who are we kidding?” 

What is the counter-factual here? I recognize neither of us have any data, but since Dr. Leong uses a thought experiment to make his assertion, I’m going to use his logic to illustrate my own speculations. Imagine that migrant workers lived six people to a room (don’t need single room lah horh), attached with their own kitchen and toilets (don’t need sauna also). When Covid hit (and when everyone has been ordered to stop working because of CB), they are able to practice social distancing, and cook for themselves in their own kitchens. They don’t have to be cramped - sometimes thirty-five people to a room - trying to practice social distancing, or rely on MOM to provide them food (dorms typically only have communal kitchens, and some dorms / FCDs don’t have kitchens at all).  I think this could have help stemmed the rapid transmission rates, even if some transmission was still inevitable because of asymptomatic carriers, as Dr. Leong pointed out. The difficulties of practicing social distancing in these dorms and warnings of a possible contagion have been sounded out as early as February by healthcare professionals such as Dr. Jeremy Lim, and echoed again by migrant groups like Geylang Adventures and TWC2. Why weren’t they heeded? This is what I would like to know, and hopefully there will be a Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry convened post-crisis to explore this, and highlight the government’s own considerations and practical constraints for the public. (And if the government already knew it was so infectious, why did it take them so long to commit to distributing free reusable masks and sanitizers for the migrant workers?) 

Dr. Leong also writes, ""I think it’s despicable for these groups to try to use this crisis to advance their lobbying. This is not the time.” I normally try to avoid emotive language in such discussions, but since you used the word, I think it is “despicable"" to accuse NGOs for being opportunistic or having an agenda. By definition, the mission of these NGOs and advocacy groups /is/ to advocate for better migrant rights. What do you want them to do - remain silent amidst a by the way, /national/ crisis? So it’s okay for them to lobby for better rights for migrant workers before Covid but not during? What about the fact that actually, Singapore is having a national conversation about migrant worker policy post-crisis now, and that their voices, together with those of migrant workers’, are very important in helping to shape that? 

Dr Leong also criticizes big mouths for having ""no sense of perspective, no sense of the costs and no sense of the practical constraints.”  This may be fair. Of course everything entails trade-offs. But I don’t think we should fault NGOs or advocacy groups or whichever “big mouths” you might be alluding to for clamouring for migrant rights or better dormitory conditions, even if you find them utopian. The job of the policymaker is to try and achieve “balance” and negotiate between somtimes competing interests and translate utopian ideals into realistic policy. The job of the advocate is to try and push the boundaries of what is possible, to shift mindsets that everything is a cost-based calculation, to introduce rights-based language into public discourse, and to push for a human-centered approach in policy-making. Everyone has a different part to play in the ecosystem. The policy maker has the unglamorous (and sadly, thankless) job of deciding how best to navigate those practical constraints, and what kinds of costs are reasonable. But this is not just an empirical question - it is also a normative one - and it is precisely the normative aspect that these “big mouths” are speaking to, by making us as a public reflect on the principles by which we arrive at these answers in the first place. 
 
Finally, Dr. Leong calls for us to “have a sense of perspective”. He writes, “We are not the only country to have massive numbers of foreign or migrant workers. I don’t believe that the living conditions of our foreigner workers are the worst in the world. Other countries have no COVID infections in their dorms or dorm-equivalents we think? Are people so naive? Note that as far as I know, we are the *only* country, where the PM has appeared on national TV to assure the foreign workers. To tell them, not worry, Singapore will take care of them. Think about that for a moment.”

I’m having trouble fully distinguishing between ""having perspective"" and outright “whataboutism”. It is true that many other countries struggle with Covid infections in their dorm equivalents, and Singapore certainly isn’t the worst in the world. But this doesn’t make the current situation right, or absolve the G of responsibility, even if it does seem to make these failings appear reasonable. We can, and should, aspire to better. I don’t think the G has done terribly on these counts, but it doesn’t mean I think they have done brilliantly either. The PM has appeared on national TV to assure the foreign workers - great. But let’s not conflate these reassurances post-crisis with Singapore’s treatment of migrant workers more generally, and let us not forget the hard work of NGOs and advocacy groups who have been crucial in pushing for more migrant worker protections both before and during this crisis. 

Of course, to quote Dr. Leong, “Don’t just believe what people tell you. Heck, don’t even believe me. Derive everything again by yourself from first principles”. Don’t believe me either. And unlike Dr. Tan and Dr. Leong, I don't have a PhD in anything and certainly don’t claim expertise - these are just my personal thoughts as a humble citizen.""",2020-05-31 06:03:09,reddit,quote yong han poh facebook post well written linked two interesting opinions matter unfortunately link subreddit doesn allow facebook links agree many things dr tan post doesn mean fully agree dr leong post either first two points yes understand numerous policy considerations apparent u turn came mix changing epidemiology strategic security concerns relating mask supply forth like dr leong blame government revising policies given changing circumstances also think remarkable testing capacity doubt many contingency plans put place avoid straining healthcare system fronts applaud government really third point want critique dr leong says hypothesis real root cause infections humongous number asymptomatic even throws thought experiment suppose government listened ngos every single one foreigner single rooms attached bathroom sauna best singapore batam also throw cleaning auntie area cleaning laundry imagine believe would allowed us avoid current problem obviously would increase social distancing maybe help somewhat guess still eating together working together people understand infectious even healthcare full ppe still catch confirm still kenna kidding counter factual recognize neither us data since dr leong uses thought experiment make assertion going use logic illustrate speculations imagine lived six people room need single room horh attached kitchen toilets need sauna also hit everyone ordered stop working cb able practice social distancing cook kitchens cramped sometimes thirty five people room trying practice social distancing rely mom provide food typically communal kitchens fcds kitchens think could help stemmed rapid transmission rates even transmission still inevitable asymptomatic carriers dr leong pointed difficulties practicing social distancing warnings possible contagion sounded early february healthcare professionals dr jeremy lim echoed groups like geylang adventures twc2 weren heeded would like know hopefully parliamentary committee inquiry convened post crisis explore highlight government considerations practical constraints public government already knew infectious take long commit distributing free reusable masks sanitizers dr leong also writes think despicable groups try use crisis advance lobbying not time normally try avoid emotive language discussions since used word think despicable accuse ngos opportunistic agenda definition mission ngos advocacy groups advocate better rights want remain silent amidst way national crisis okay lobby better rights not fact actually singapore national conversation policy post crisis voices together important helping shape dr leong also criticizes big mouths no sense perspective no sense costs no sense practical constraints may fair course everything entails trade offs think should fault ngos advocacy groups whichever big mouths might alluding clamouring rights better conditions even find utopian job policymaker try achieve balance negotiate somtimes competing interests translate utopian ideals realistic policy job advocate try push boundaries possible shift mindsets everything cost based calculation introduce rights based language public discourse push human centered approach policy making everyone different part play ecosystem policy maker unglamorous sadly thankless job deciding best navigate practical constraints kinds costs reasonable not empirical question also normative one precisely normative aspect big mouths speaking making us public reflect principles arrive answers first place finally dr leong calls us sense perspective writes not country massive numbers believe living conditions foreigner worst world countries no infections equivalents think people naive note far know country pm appeared national tv assure tell not worry singapore take care think moment trouble fully distinguishing perspective outright whataboutism true many countries struggle infections equivalents singapore certainly worst world doesn make current situation right absolve g responsibility even seem make failings appear reasonable should aspire better think g done terribly counts doesn mean think done brilliantly either pm appeared national tv assure great let not conflate reassurances post crisis singapore treatment generally let us not forget hard work ngos advocacy groups crucial pushing protections crisis course quote dr leong believe people tell heck even believe derive everything first principles believe either unlike dr tan dr leong phd anything certainly claim expertise personal thoughts humble citizen

"Unpopular opinion: nothing will happen to the dorm owners and it is not their fault

I'm a business owner and at some point of time, considered converting part of the factory to a dorm. The requirements are very much stricter than what OP has made it out to be. 

There are restrictions on how many beds you can put in a certain area, how many toilets per number of ppl, fire safety requirements, a sickbay separate from living qtrs must be planned, WiFi is compulsory, even entertainment is a must. These are all set out by big G not the dorm owners. Why will any dorm owner go beyond the basic requirement to make a loss? 

Most people will not believe it but the obscene environment is actually caused by the workers themselves. The best example is hanging clothes. By law, the dorm owner must specifically have an area just for hanging clothes because hanging clothes in your sleeping qtrs is asking for disease to spread but the workers would rather hang them in their own rooms for convenience. 

Many do not practice basic hygiene. My own employees said it was a living hell with bedbug infestations so we moved them out.

There's a limit to how much we can interfere with free market and more importantly, how nice should we treat the employees? Should the cost rise to 2-3k per employee?

"Ex-Deputy Prime Ministers Tharman and Teo Chee Hean brought in to handle manpower matters -deputy-prime...r-matters/After Senior Ministers Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Teo Chee Hean were roped in to handle manpower matters like the jobs council and the foreign worker dormitories situation, some Singaporeans are speculating whether Manpower Minister Josephine Teo was given too big a portfolio for her to cope with.Mr Tharman and Mr Teo served as Singapore’s Deputy Prime Ministers from 2011 to 2019. The pair stepped down from their posts and became Senior Ministers on 1 May 2019, following a Cabinet reshuffle that was designed to give fourth-generation (4G) ministers more exposure and responsibilities so that they can better support the next Prime Minister who will come from their cohort.The Cabinet reshuffle saw the ruling People’s Action Party’s (PAP) 4G cohort accept several promotions that resulted in them leading two-thirds of the Government’s ministries. Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat kept his ministry but also succeeded Mr Tharman and Mr Teo as Singapore’s sole Deputy Prime Minister, giving rise to speculation that he is the ruling party’s Prime Minister designate.Besides Mr Tharman and Mr Teo, fellow veteran politician Lim Swee Say stepped down from his post as Manpower Minister and was succeeded by Josephine Teo, who became Singapore’s second female minister to helm a ministry after Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu.While Mr Tharman and Mr Teo seemed to take a backseat to allow the younger ministers to take charge, they have now taken on important responsibilities that pertain to manpower.Current DPM Heng Swee Keat tapped on Mr Tharman to chair the new National Jobs Council. Asserting that his predecessor has “both detailed knowledge and deep expertise in this issue” in his latest supplementary budget speech last month, Mr Heng revealed that the National Jobs Council will focus on creating jobs and helping workers build deep skills to stay employable in the challenging economy.Mr Teo was brought in to handle the foreign worker dormitories issue after COVID-19 outbreaks in the dorms ended up infecting over 33,567 workers and counting. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that Mr Teo is playing an advisory role in the Government’s inter agency task force to handle the situation in the dorms.The veteran politicians’ involvement in what are perceived as manpower matters has raised questions about the capabilities of Manpower Minister Josephine Teo.Mrs Teo was just recently under public scrutiny for the way she handled the COVID-19 outbreaks at the foreign worker dormitories. Some Singaporeans blamed the minister for allowing the COVID-19 situation to spiral out of control among migrant workers even though she was warned in advance that this might happen due to the workers’ overcrowded living conditions.When she was asked why she did not act early in implementing safe distancing measures in the dorms before the coronavirus infection spread uncontrolled, Mrs Teo did not apologise and instead blamed a lack of hindsight.Expressing a wish to “rewind the clock” to implement safe distancing measures in the dorms earlier, she told the local press: “If possible, I really wish to know at which stage the infection has already spread to community and migrant workers group? If time can be rewound, this is what I wish I could know.”",2020-06-06 10:25:00,sgtalk,ex deputy prime ministers tharman teo chee hean brought handle manpower matters deputy prime r matters senior ministers tharman shanmugaratnam teo chee hean roped handle manpower matters like jobs council situation singaporeans speculating whether manpower minister josephine teo given big portfolio cope mr tharman mr teo served singapore deputy prime ministers 2011 2019 pair stepped posts became senior ministers 1 may 2019 following cabinet reshuffle designed give fourth generation 4g ministers exposure responsibilities better support next prime minister come cohort cabinet reshuffle saw ruling people action party pap 4g cohort accept several promotions resulted leading two thirds government ministries finance minister heng swee keat kept ministry also succeeded mr tharman mr teo singapore sole deputy prime minister giving rise speculation ruling party prime minister designate besides mr tharman mr teo fellow veteran politician lim swee say stepped post manpower minister succeeded josephine teo became singapore second female minister helm ministry minister culture community youth grace fu mr tharman mr teo seemed take backseat allow younger ministers take charge taken important responsibilities pertain manpower current dpm heng swee keat tapped mr tharman chair new national jobs council asserting predecessor detailed knowledge deep expertise issue latest supplementary budget speech last month mr heng revealed national jobs council focus creating jobs helping build deep skills stay employable challenging economy mr teo brought handle issue outbreaks ended infecting 33 567 counting prime minister lee hsien loong said mr teo playing advisory role government inter agency task force handle situation veteran politicians involvement perceived manpower matters raised questions capabilities manpower minister josephine teo mrs teo recently public scrutiny way handled outbreaks singaporeans blamed minister allowing situation spiral control among even though warned advance might happen due overcrowded living conditions asked not act early implementing safe distancing measures infection spread uncontrolled mrs teo not apologise instead blamed lack hindsight expressing wish rewind clock implement safe distancing measures earlier told local press possible really wish know stage infection already spread community group time rewound wish could know

"Potong Pasir SMC resident since late 2018
Previously Bukit Batok SMC resident, voted twice (GE then By Election - Murali v Chee)

I’m always cautious about assuming what the sentiment on the ground is. Reddit is a bubble and so are our take on things. But I thought I’d chip in with my own sentiments. 

Potong Pasir is a tough call. It’s a “low risk” SMC with rich political history and it could go either way. On one hand, under Sitoh’s watch, there are now covered walkways from the MRT to all blocks, the canal was spruced up and looks great, home improvement, etc. The area looks modern with very little sense of Chiam left. The older residents look back fondly on their Chiam days but appreciate new, better accessibility. Younger families like mine have moved into the estate, plus there are new residential developments. We are in between. Losing Sitoh frankly isn’t a great loss to parliament so trying out Jose is a risk worth taking since he isn’t a bad candidate. It may be a 50/50, 60/40, but even if it’s 70/30, it’ll be more that it was a tough choice rather than people felt much more strongly for one over the other. TBH, as an election official AND resident, I am quite excited to see how this plays out. 

Chee has mellowed since he last contested Bukit Batok where Murali won convincingly, even though in a By Election people have a chance to be a bit more daring in their vote if the party of their choice is already comfortably in government. Whatever is circulating online, my personal take on Murali was that he is a sincere MP. And he won in 2016 because the ground knows him. People who vote for Murali will vote for their MP. People who vote for Chee may vote with more macro objectives.",2020-06-30 23:37:25,reddit,potong pasir smc resident since late 2018 previously bukit batok smc resident voted twice ge election murali v chee always cautious assuming sentiment ground reddit bubble take things thought chip sentiments potong pasir tough call low risk smc rich political history could go either way one hand sitoh watch covered walkways mrt blocks canal spruced looks great home improvement etc area looks modern little sense chiam left older residents look back fondly chiam days appreciate new better accessibility younger families like mine moved estate plus new residential developments losing sitoh frankly great loss parliament trying jose risk worth taking since bad candidate may 50 50 60 40 even 70 30 tough choice rather people felt much strongly one tbh election official resident quite excited see plays chee mellowed since last contested bukit batok murali won convincingly even though election people chance bit daring vote party choice already comfortably government whatever circulating online personal take murali sincere mp won 2016 ground knows people vote murali vote mp people vote chee may vote macro objectives

So it's very likely that the virus spread had been going around for some time in the dormitories, and we are now seeing all the indicators of it.""He said that Singapore is currently dealing with two separate infections  within the foreign worker dormitories, where the numbers are rising sharply, and within the general population, where the numbers are more stable now.MOH working with MOM, SPF, MINDEF and SAFWith regard to the dormitory clusters, MOH has been working very closely with the joint task force that's led by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the Singapore Police Force (SPF), Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).MOH has set-up medical posts in the dormitories where medical personnel can look after workers as they present with symptoms.In addition, MOH is also performing an active case finding to look for workers who are not well and bring them down for further assessment if necessary.When symptomatic workers are identified, they would be immediately isolated and prevented from mixing with other workers in the dormitory.If they test positive for Covid-19, they will be treated at a hospital or community isolation facility.Those who are not tested positive but remain symptomatic they will be kept separated so as to prevent any infection from spreading to other workers in the dormitory.-...-mustafa-link/",2020-09-04 21:03:00,hardwarezone,thursday apr 9 ministry health moh announced 287 new brings total number singapore 1 910 new today 200 related residing links seven clustersspeaking press conference apr 9 moh director medical science kenneth mak revealed contact tracing efforts established links seven clusters mustafa centreproject glory construction sites11 punggoltampines dormitorytoh guan dormitorysungei tengah lodgecochrane lodge iias apr 8 total number clusters excluding ones mustafa 224 started mustafa clustermak explained began mustafa cluster number employees mall tested positive believe visited mustafa subsequently transmitted infection co either project glory construction site residents within lived said mak believed transmissions likely occurred close contact mealtimes physical proximity construction site subsequently transmitted friends colleagues within social activities continued work despite mild symptomsnational development minister lawrence wong added many mild symptoms thus continued work stated delay picking likely spread going around time seeing indicators said singapore currently dealing two separate infections within numbers rising sharply within general population numbers stable moh working mom spf mindef safwith regard clusters moh working closely joint task force led ministry manpower mom singapore police force spf ministry defence mindef singapore armed forces saf moh set medical posts medical personnel look present symptoms addition moh also performing active case finding look not well bring assessment necessary symptomatic identified would immediately isolated prevented mixing test positive treated hospital community isolation facility not tested positive remain symptomatic kept separated prevent infection spreading mustafa link

"For business, it's always about P&L. Social pressure is mainly a consideration as a factor of brand value, which again translates to P&L.

There are profitable but socially awkward businesses, e.g. cigarettes, prostitution, social escort, weapons manufacturing. Despite the social pressure, the business operators continue because of profits.

> Actually it’s not about the operators not wanting to give the residents decent life 

They do, but never at the expense of P&L. If the operators can squeeze in 20 people in a small room, they will. It's only the government regulations which prevent them.

The issue is not about the social objections. 

>We already have seen the faces of few masters on how they treat their maids. 

Please be mindful of *Negativity Bias*. Bad news sell better, that's a fact. This gives the false impression that Singaporeans are abusing their FDW regularly. In truth, Singaporeans are just like any other employers in other parts of the world. There are a few abusive ones, but the majority are compassionate people.

In fact, close to [8 in 10 Singaporeans](--en/index.htm) are were in favour of improved labour conditions for foreign domestic workers (FDW). 

It is not lack of popular support for better welfare of FW. It's the lack of political willpower. The government is being weighed down by an important but low productivity industry (construction) for many years. Singapore construction sector is 30% less productive than Japan. Using a simplified reduction, the density of the dorm here can be reduced by 30% if we reach the productivity level of Japan.

"> Why don't you take office first

This is a fallacy. One does not need to take up any form of office to impress the opinion that something needs to be done. If this were so, nobody could say ""this is right."" or ""this is wrong."" without having first studied the law. 

>then show me the space to quarantine 20,000 workers who are not even nationals.

we need them. they need us. it is a relationship of symbiosis. the least we can do is provide food, shelter, and compensation. in times of peace, it is left to capitalism, the dormitory operator, the construction companies' hiring practices. in times of a humanitarian disaster-in-waiting, it is not just for the taskforce, or government to help. it is for everyone. this is not a singaporean issue. this is a humanitarian issue (read: human issue). your position of ""why should we help those not even singapore nationals"" reeks, REEKS of hierarchy, as if you believe there is a natural order when it comes down to humanity. they are on singapore soil. they are our issue. in the first place, we should have housed them adequately. do you live in a HDB? say a regular 4-room HDB with a 4-member family. you wanna live in the same size flat with 4 times the people? or more?  if you cannot accept it for yourself, don't foist it on other people. 

>Show me the volunteers/fnb employees, who they themselves have to observe social distancing measures, that are willing to cook 2-3 meals a day for that many people.

as i said above, it is a humanitarian issue. it is not for our leaders to beseech the population for volunteers to cook and clean for them out of goodwill, but to say i hire you to provide x y z to these workers. 

>Keep in mind that the conditions we've provided for them are already arguably better than what they have in their home countries

"-highligh...er-dormitories5TH APR 2020    The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) had issued advisories on enhanced precautionary measures in dormitories to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission. However transmissions within foreign worker dormitories have continued to rise and we are seeing more confirmed cases and workers who are ill. The S11 Dormitory @ Punggol (2 Seletar North Link) and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory (18 Toh Guan Road East) are of particular concern.2.    The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has decided that further measures are necessary to contain the risk of further transmission among the foreign workers within these two dormitories. This would keep the workers safe, as well as protect the wider community from widespread transmission from these clusters. Both S11 Dormitory @ Punggol and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory have been declared as isolation areas. Onsite medical support has been deployed, along with provision of food and essential supplies.Measures to contain further outbreak3.    The S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, with 13,000 resident workers, and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory, with 6,800 resident workers, have been gazetted as isolation areas. Given the rising number of confirmed cases, this is necessary to avoid the risk of further transmissions from any potentially infected workers to others in the dormitories, as well as into the community. Workers who are symptomatic have already been isolated.4.    Within these two dormitories, precautionary steps have also been taken to protect workers who are well. All the affected workers will not go to work. Access to recreational facilities will be regulated to reduce the inter-mixing of workers. Movement between blocks is prohibited. Workers have also been advised to cease social interactions with others who do not reside in the same room or floor.5.    MOM is working closely with all dormitory operators, to implement similar measures within their premises with immediate effect. Efforts are also underway in the larger dormitories to reduce the density of their resident workers, by transferring some among them to alternative accommodation during this period.Support provided to workers6.    The workers will continue to be paid their salaries for the duration of the quarantine. Their period of absence from work is treated as paid hospitalisation leave as part of the worker’s leave eligibility under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA). Their employers are eligible to claim for the $100 daily quarantine allowance.7.    Arrangements will be made to cater three meals a day for all affected workers for the duration of the quarantine. They will also be issued with reusable masks, surgical masks, thermometers, hand sanitisers and other essentials so they can keep themselves safe and comfortable.8.    Onsite medical support has been deployed to support the workers residing at both dormitories. The dormitories have also implemented enhanced health screening measures, such as requiring workers to check and report their temperature twice daily, as well as the regular monitoring for fever and respiratory symptoms. Those who are unwell will be isolated and will be assessed by medical personnel for further attention. Support provided to companies with affected workers9.    Companies that are providing essential services with workers affected by this quarantine order will be supported and arrangements will be made to ensure these essential services can continue to be provided.Advisory to dormitory operators10.   Dormitory operators and workers living in dormitories are reminded of the importance of maintaining high standards of hygiene and cleanliness to safeguard their own health and those of others who are living in the same space. Safe distancing measures must be strictly adhered to. These include measures such as no inter-mixing of workers between dormitory blocks and floors, and for workers to stay within their rooms and to minimise interactions.11.   Social responsibility is critical in slowing the transmission of the virus. We need every individual to play their part in the fight against the virus. Those who are unwell, even with mild flu-like symptoms, should not be at work. They must see a doctor immediately to prevent spreading illness to others.MINISTRY OF HEALTH & MINISTRY OF MANPOWER5 APRIL 2020MOH think they can outrun the virus with such half-f**ked reactive measures......how wrong they are.....",2020-05-04 19:53:00,hardwarezone,highligh er dormitories5th apr 2020 ministry manpower mom issued advisories enhanced precautionary measures minimise risk transmission however transmissions within continued rise seeing confirmed ill s11 punggol 2 seletar north link westlite toh guan 18 toh guan road east particular concern 2 multi ministry taskforce decided measures necessary contain risk transmission among within two would keep safe well protect wider community widespread transmission clusters s11 punggol westlite toh guan declared isolation areas onsite medical support deployed along provision food essential supplies measures contain outbreak3 s11 punggol 13 000 resident westlite toh guan 6 800 resident gazetted isolation areas given rising number confirmed necessary avoid risk transmissions potentially infected others well community symptomatic already isolated 4 within two precautionary steps also taken protect well affected not go work access recreational facilities regulated reduce inter mixing movement blocks prohibited also advised cease social interactions others not reside room floor 5 mom working closely operators implement similar measures within premises immediate effect efforts also underway larger reduce density resident transferring among alternative accommodation period support provided workers6 continue paid salaries duration quarantine period absence work treated paid hospitalisation leave part leave eligibility employment manpower act efma employers eligible claim 100 daily quarantine allowance 7 arrangements made cater three meals day affected duration quarantine also issued reusable masks surgical masks thermometers hand sanitisers essentials keep safe comfortable 8 onsite medical support deployed support residing also implemented enhanced health screening measures requiring check report temperature twice daily well regular monitoring fever respiratory symptoms unwell isolated assessed medical personnel attention support provided companies affected workers9 companies providing essential services affected quarantine order supported arrangements made ensure essential services continue provided advisory operators10 operators living reminded importance maintaining high standards hygiene cleanliness safeguard health others living space safe distancing measures must strictly adhered include measures no inter mixing blocks floors stay within rooms minimise interactions 11 social responsibility critical slowing transmission need every individual play part fight against unwell even mild flu like symptoms should not work must see doctor immediately prevent spreading illness others ministry health ministry manpower5 april 2020moh think outrun half f ked reactive measures wrong

"How in the world is it that what you manage to take away from that chunk of text that *math is important, and if you can't do math brown people should die?*

Literal tax paying citizens of Hong Kong lives in more inhumane conditions. Did you even read what I wrote? 

Living in a dormitory cluster is not inhumane. We are not throwing them into the slums where people have to literally live surrounded by their own waste with no readily available source of water or sanitary toilets. 

Just what kind of living conditions do you believe FW dorms to be?

They won't die if covid did not exist, and more people are dying per capita from covid in the United States than foreign workers.

If you are using deaths from covid as a statistic, the citizens of the United States has less livable condition than foreign workers in Singapore. If you are saying people are dying because of the living condition, bring up evidence, because as far as I can tell, nothing has even come close to being negligent enough to cause death. 

Most if not all foreign worker death comes from workplace accidents.

Clearly that's not an accurate way to measure living conditions.

They live in humane conditions. Living in a bunk setting is far from inhumane. Amenities are provided to ensure they are living in humane condition.

"I see your points but this is really a long game and we need to start somewhere. 

There was a push but recently has definitely stagnated. I mean just compare an average construction worker here and one in south korea, germany etc. Clearly there is huge rooms for improvement, why is this not happening? Beside training its the whole “lifecycle” of vocational training, respected nature of the job, pay and responsibility. I agree training wont be enough, its far deeper than that. Its a whole structural change. To change this will need very big mindset shift and right policies. Probably will take 20years minimum but need to start somewhere. SG need to get off this addiction. I mean think about it why is it that singapore, gulf states among developed countries are the only ones doing this? 

Yes there is some migrant labour due to lower cost also in other developed countries(Eg from Poland within EU) but they dont take up the majority, in sg its 99%+.

In the past you can make the argument that in order to make SG grow as fast as possible to reach first world status we took cheap labour so locals could focus on higher skilled jobs but in recent years economy has not grown that much. We already reached a very high status, among top in GDP/capita in fact. We are no longer catchup like in the past yet we see cheap labour in same way. Something is wrong here. Better be a respected construction supervisor than a jobless PMET...

Also when it comes to gov i disagree the gov is pushing hard for it. As TWC2 pointed out the rules are not being enforced properly. In addition companies tender for gov contracts. Surely gov can stipulate a minimum standard. Again need to be enforced and not just going through the motions. Gov can push a lot harder here. Just having all rules followed would make a big impact.

If you go and measure your own temperature it is likely 36.5-36.6 degrees....What is going on?Because of very hygenic environment the people in Western Europe have immune systems with threshold trottled down one symptom of that is lower body temperature which has been decreasing every decade.

" Foreign workers who are unwell are being identified and separated from other workers, said the multi-agency task force tackling the Covid-19 outbreak, adding that even those who do not show symptoms but are close contacts of confirmed cases are being tested.As of Tuesday (April 14), it said about 7,000 workers who are well and working in essential services have been moved outside of dormitories to other accommodations such as army camps.The task force gave an outline of the measures that have been taken in recent days to tackle the spike in the number of Covid-19 cases involving foreign worker dormitories.It said more than 1,500 workers who have been transferred out of dormitories deemed as isolation areas have been tested over the weekend, and about 5,000 workers are expected to be tested in the next few days.The Ministry of Health's director of medical services, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, said in a virtual press conference: ""Our commitment to the foreign workers is that if they are infected, we want to find them, and we want to be very clear that we're not intending to leave them alone, unattended.""So if we have any concerns, particularly in any of the dormitories where there is, in fact, an infected foreign worker, then we want to know where they are and we will make plans to test as many of them as is possible.""Work is ongoing to test asymptomatic workers or those with minimal symptoms, Prof Mak said.""In some dormitories, we have started work to screen close contacts of confirmed cases. For example, they may be fellow workers who share the same room and, because of their proximity of contact in their living arrangements, are deemed therefore as at higher risk.""We also have tested various other foreign workers in different settings. For example, for some of the workers that have in fact been transferred out from the dormitories that are deemed as isolation areas, we've also tested as a precaution to make sure that as we transfer workers from one place to another, we're not also then seeding new areas, and therefore contributing causing more clusters.""Replying to a question on the number of patients housed at the Singapore Expo, Prof Mak said there were 297 patients there as of yesterday. Another 150 to 160 patients will be transferred there today.""It's steadily building... in fact, would span across several halls. At this point in time, we are planning to use Halls 1 to 6, but we have opened Hall 3 first,"" he said.""And as Hall 3 progressively gets filled up to its full capacity of 480 cases... then we would progressively open the other halls as well until we reach our full capacity.""",2020-04-14 20:25:00,hardwarezone,unwell identified separated said multi agency task force tackling outbreak adding even not show symptoms close contacts confirmed tested tuesday april 14 said 7 000 well working essential services moved outside accommodations army camps task force gave outline measures taken recent days tackle spike number involving said 1 500 transferred deemed isolation areas tested weekend 5 000 expected tested next days ministry health director medical services associate professor kenneth mak said virtual press conference commitment infected want find want clear not intending leave alone unattended concerns particularly fact infected want know make plans test many possible work ongoing test asymptomatic minimal symptoms prof mak said started work screen close contacts confirmed example may fellow share room proximity contact living arrangements deemed therefore higher risk also tested various different settings example fact transferred deemed isolation areas also tested precaution make sure transfer one place another not also seeding new areas therefore contributing causing clusters replying question number patients housed singapore expo prof mak said 297 patients yesterday another 150 160 patients transferred today steadily building fact would span across several halls point time planning use halls 1 6 opened hall 3 first said hall 3 progressively gets filled full capacity 480 would progressively open halls well reach full capacity
"Linked vs non-linked, age groups

The current categorisation is very Singaporean-centric if you critically examine it. 

Why is there a need to split work permit holders into two categories (dorm and non-dorm)? The ones who don't stay in the dorm are as likely to have spread the virus as those other the ""local cases in the community"" category since their residences are not geographically removed from the rest of us. 

There category of ""local cases in the community"" is quite strange also if you consider that someone living in Bedok will probably not get the virus from someone living in Jurong/Yishun and vice versa. Given the current measures in place to minimise the spread of the virus.

Overall the categorisation is fully not geographical or spatial. It's just based on nationality yet trying to conflate spatial proximity with differences in nationality.",2020-04-18 18:23:25,reddit,linked vs non linked age groups current categorisation singaporean centric critically examine need split work permit holders two categories non ones stay likely spread local community category since residences not geographically removed rest us category local community quite strange also consider someone living bedok probably not get someone living jurong yishun vice versa given current measures place minimise spread overall categorisation fully not geographical spatial based nationality yet trying conflate spatial proximity differences nationality

"Hi there, coz of my poly project many years back, I have been to those shophouses in Little India, Farrer Park that was converted into living dorms for foreign workers and we interviewed them too. If u are wondering how we gained access to these shophouses, it's coz one of my proj mate's dad is a contractor and he allowed us access to the shophouses dorms.

So this is what I have observed and it's based on my perspective, first floor is their kitchen and toilet/laundry area and second floor is their bunk beds where they sleep.

First floor when I step in, it's the kitchen, there were dead cockroaches and ants crawling around. There were one foreign worker in charge of meal at the time, preparing meals for everyone (they all were given a role in the dorm) the quality of the food was subpar, for example vegetable was full of holes and yellowish and eggs were already past the expiration date. (They had no choice as they were given these food to cook their meals as some do not wish to spend their money on groceries)

"You also need to consider that checks were done by government agencies to clear these to be ""fit to live"" in.

Minister of State & Manpower stated 
> Mr Zaqy said conditions at the dormitory were found to be satisfactory when the last inspection was done on March 4.

So if ""shitty conditions"" can pass MOM inspection standards.

Question to be asked:

* Are amenities adequate for the workers to use?
* Is the inspection criteria stringent to ensure liveability? (Electrical, plumbing etc) Or the inspection was done half fuck?
* Problem of deplorable living conditions have already been around from initial -> current ""satisfactory"" conditions. Are the laws/ standards created to hit the bare minimum of the workers ""rights""? Social workers working with them have already mentioned these issues over many years.

[Source](-conditions-at-punggol-dormitory-could-have-been-better-maintained-as-it-was-made)

Even if the workers fuck shit up in the dorms, isn't inspection meant to uncover these teething problems and reflect it to ministry & dormitory providers?

I see all these moves by the governing agency to move them out as a way to 

* Solve current ""satisfactory but deplorable"" conditions on paper
* Solve the now exploding increase of infection rate
* Sweep their crap way of handling treating of FW from the past till current under the rug (inspection criteria) 
* Acknowledge but don't apologize for past failings wrt. handling of the foreign workers situation

Ultimately, we as a society need to pay the price for the situation mentioned above. Prices of HDB have remained pretty cheap while cost of workers have increased over time. We as a society have also chosen to push them away from general population areas in fear of losing property value etc.

The actual reporting is good. The guidelines for purpose built dorms were made in response to the riots. But the standards are clearly not strict enough or not enforced. Forget about facilities. The number of residents per sq ft of sleeping area, the ratio of stoves, toilets, showers and sinks to residents, is it enough?

According to Speak for Climate, The current building code says that “A minimum of 4.5sqm Gross Floor Area of living space per worker shall be provided”. This minimum standard is 6 times lower than the average living space per Singaporean of 27 sqm.

The current environmental health guidelines for dormitories are 1 water closet, 1 urinal, 1 wash-hand basin, and 1 shower room for every 15 workers. This standard is close to 3 times worse than the International Labour Organisation (ILO)’s recommendation of a minimum of 1 toilet, 1 wash basin and 1 shower for every 6 persons.

Edit: of course I don't think we should match 27 sqm. But 6 times less is a lot smaller. HDB and URA has maximum occupancy for a residence if occupants do not form a family unit. A 2 room flat has a maximum occupancy of 4 unrelated people and is from 36-45 sq m and has 1 toilet, shower, and 2 sinks, one in the kitchen. 3 room flat and above can fit 6 unrelated people, and for 3 room (60-65 sq m) there are 2 toilets, 2 showers, and 3 sinks. 

The minimum ratio is therefore 9 sq m per person in HDB. Even a family of 10 in a 3 room HDB would be 6 sq m per person, and 1 person better than ILO recommendations.  These are ratios that we can apply.",2020-05-02 13:23:18,reddit,actual reporting good guidelines purpose built made response riots standards clearly not strict enough not enforced forget facilities number residents per sq ft sleeping area ratio stoves toilets showers sinks residents enough according speak climate current building code says minimum 4 5sqm gross floor area living space per shall provided minimum standard 6 times lower average living space per singaporean 27 sqm current environmental health guidelines 1 water closet 1 urinal 1 wash hand basin 1 shower room every 15 standard close 3 times worse international labour organisation ilo recommendation minimum 1 toilet 1 wash basin 1 shower every 6 persons edit course think should match 27 sqm 6 times less lot smaller hdb ura maximum occupancy residence occupants not form family unit 2 room flat maximum occupancy 4 unrelated people 36 45 sq 1 toilet shower 2 sinks one kitchen 3 room flat fit 6 unrelated people 3 room 60 65 sq 2 toilets 2 showers 3 sinks minimum ratio therefore 9 sq per person hdb even family 10 3 room hdb would 6 sq per person 1 person better ilo recommendations ratios apply

Second, stop strawmanning me. My claim was merely that there are 200,000 workers in Singapore in dorms - you kindly agreed to share a quote that said there was 323,000. At no point did I suggest they were all living in squalor. All I am suggesting is that given the increased proximity of dorm living compared to the average Singaporean (whether ""excellent condition"" or ""squalor"") means that the covid infection rate amongst them is higher. This is evidenced by the increasing number of dorms being termed ""isolation areas""- so far, there are 18. Unless you are making the claim that all ""isolation"" areas are squalid  and the rest are fine and as likely to facilitate covid infection as any other party of Everyday living (which, by the way, is at some odds with your point that they are not all living in squalor), I think we can agree dorms are worth the government attention at the moment.",2020-04-23 12:15:41,reddit,problem intrinsically tied problem means deserving national attention citizens livelihoods tied problem reducing sufficiently resume semblance business functioning hence citizens livelihoods tied problem not enough justification govt giving direct link reducing problem would consider good expenditure tax money help us second stop strawmanning claim merely 200 000 singapore kindly agreed share quote said 323 000 no point suggest living squalor suggesting given increased proximity living compared average singaporean whether excellent condition squalor means infection rate amongst higher evidenced increasing number termed isolation areas far 18 unless making claim isolation areas squalid rest fine likely facilitate infection party everyday living way odds point not living squalor think agree worth government attention moment
"We need to know the % of tests that are positive. If the % positive is still going up, that means that even though more targeted testing is being done, it cannot keep up with the spread. If the % positive is going down, it means that we are making progress in containing the spread in the dorms.

> many around us do actually have the virus, just that we are not showing symptoms and are not getting tested. 

This is quite unlikely in Singapore. In other countries where people with mild symptoms aren't getting tested, yes, the % who've had it will be much higher than the confirmed cases. In those countries, everyone knows someone (or personally experienced it) who had very suspicious symptoms but couldn't get tested. Community transmission is widespread.

"> # COVID-19 tally in S'pore crosses 39,000 mark with 422 new cases; one S'porean among 5 community infections

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 422 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Thursday (11 June) noon, bringing the total to 39,387.

> “Based on our investigations so far, there are five cases in the community, of whom one is a Singaporean and four are work pass holders,” said the MOH, adding that the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories.

> The ministry said more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of over 2,700 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Jurong Penjuru Dormitory, Tuas View Dormitory and Cassia @ Penjuru.

> The five are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas.

> Some 400,000 such workers live in dorms here in Singapore, of which about 10 per cent have been cleared of the infection, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on 1 June during a press conference.

> Over 20,000 infected foreign workers have recovered, added Teo.

> The story will be updated later at night.

> MOH STATEMENT IN FULL

> With 655 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Wednesday, 26,532 cases – 68 per cent of the total tally – have fully recovered from the infection.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while three are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Over 12,000 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 25 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, nine others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and two whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> As of 8 June, the ministry has conducted 488,695 swab tests, of which 284,963 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 85,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 50,000 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

> On Tuesday, the ministry added one more public place to a list of locations – first published on 25 May – visited by infectious cases in the community for over 30 minutes. Hougang Green Shopping Mall at 21 Hougang Street 51 was visited on 3 June from 12pm to 1pm.

> The list – which excludes residences, workplaces, healthcare facilities, and public transport – will be updated on a rolling 14-day basis or one incubation period.

"A new taskforce has been created to specifically manage the COVID-19 outbreak among foreign workers here.Announced at a COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce (MTF) virtual press conference on Thursday (9 April), the foreign worker taskforce comprises Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean as advisor, and members of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and Singapore Police Force (SPF). It has been operationalised since Monday.MTF co-chair Lawrence Wong explained that cases among foreign workers are increasing at an alarming rate, compared to the increase in the general population, which is more stable. The government therefore has to actively intervene in this very major and urgent issue.The approach to tackling it is two-pronged, said Wong.First, the government will work together with dormitory operators to ensure effective management across all dorms. Secondly, there will be heightened public health measures in place, including active screening and testing of workers, and the provision of medical posts on-site at the dorms.Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said, An established, replicated, sustained approach has to be adopted. We have a responsibility to these foreign workers who have come all the way here at considerate expense to make a living in Singapore.Living conditions in dormitoriesSince Monday, steps have been taken to standardise the delivery of daily needs within the four dorms gazetted as social isolation areas. These include the timely delivery of quality meals, cleaning and removal of garbage up to three times a day and disinfection of the premises up to three times daily.These have been co-ordinated by nine-member FAST teams  made up of SAF or SPF personnel and MOM officers  since Monday.By Tuesday, we had three FAST teams working with dorm operators. By Wednesday, we had put together 43 FAST teams, matching them with dorm operators, said Teo. Some 400 personnel are involved in total.Standards at the dormitories have improved greatly, said Teo, and the government will replicate these measures and standards in all dormitories, regardless whether they are gazetted as isolation areas or not.This will affect some 200,000 workers in 43 dorms. More than 5,000 healthy workers who are providing essential services have already been moved out of the dorms. Places where the government is housing them temporarily include SAF military camps, Changi Exhibition Centre, floating hotels and vacant HDB blocks.The Manpower Minister also pointed out that authorities had already began taking precautions in the dormitories from end-January, with all returning work place holders required to serve Leave Of Absence (LOA) and subsequently Stay Home Notices (SHN). This policy started with China workers and was later extended to all returning workers.90,000 inspection calls were also made on those serving LOA or SHN. 90 individuals work passes were also revoked in order to signal the importance of measures, said Teo.Teo said that ultimately, We need to thin out the dorms (and) reduce the number of people in order to have effective safe distancing measures.This is really important, we have to get it right.-19-t...122006700.html",2020-09-04 20:34:00,hardwarezone,new taskforce created specifically manage outbreak among announced multi ministry taskforce mtf virtual press conference thursday 9 april taskforce comprises senior minister teo chee hean advisor members singapore armed forces saf singapore police force spf operationalised since monday mtf co chair lawrence wong explained among increasing alarming rate compared increase general population stable government therefore actively intervene major urgent issue approach tackling two pronged said wong first government work together operators ensure effective management across secondly heightened public health measures place including active screening testing provision medical posts site manpower minister josephine teo said established replicated sustained approach adopted responsibility come way considerate expense make living singapore living conditions dormitoriessince monday steps taken standardise delivery daily needs within four gazetted social isolation areas include timely delivery quality meals cleaning removal garbage three times day disinfection premises three times daily co ordinated nine member fast teams made saf spf personnel mom officers since monday tuesday three fast teams working operators wednesday put together 43 fast teams matching operators said teo 400 personnel involved total standards improved greatly said teo government replicate measures standards regardless whether gazetted isolation areas not affect 200 000 43 5 000 healthy providing essential services already moved places government housing temporarily include saf military camps changi exhibition centre floating hotels vacant hdb blocks manpower minister also pointed authorities already began taking precautions end january returning work place holders required serve leave absence loa subsequently stay home notices shn policy started china later extended returning 90 000 inspection calls also made serving loa shn 90 individuals work passes also revoked order signal importance measures said teo teo said ultimately need thin reduce number people order effective safe distancing measures really important get right 122006700 html

The conditions facing the FW and Singaporeans are very different, FW are trapped inside their dorms and can't leave meaning they would not be in contact with most Singaporeans (the general community) whereas the Singaporean/PR cases will, its 2 different situations with varying consequences so they have to be seperated. 800++ confirmed cases roaming around everywhere from Jurong to Woodlands is very different from 800++ cases in S11, one is much harder to contain than the other. As shitty as it might feel to you, in the interest of accuracy you will have to seperate them since its such different situations.

"Why the PAP has failed14 Feb - there was a foreign worker tested positive for COVID-19 and he was rushed into ICU a day later. 17 Feb - 2 more foreign workers were tested positive for the virus. 18 Feb - it was revealed that they formed a new cluster from a work site.News came out and employers rushed to send their foreign workers, who are unwell, to the hospital for a swab test.19 Feb - MOM published a news article from Mr Kelvin Teoh (divisional director of MOM for foreign workers) that employers must not send the foreign workers to the hospital or they may have their WORK PASS privileges suspended. Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet. The poor foreign workers in numbers of 300,000 became victims of the PAP government, due to their lack of hindsight and that huge stench of arrogance to listen to the public when many threads about the issue was raised in and around mid Feb.

Major Discrepancy found in MOH's situation report for the 3rd instance. This is between 10-5 and 9-5 situation reports.  This time there is a sharp drop of the number of cases of WP(STOD) cases from 627 to 466 people. WP(STOD)10-5 figure should be 627+11 = 638however it was reported as 466.638-466 = 172 cases shortfall.DORM10-5- figure should be 19971+860 = 20831however it was reported as 20961.20961-20831 = 130 cases increase.172-130 = 42 cases balance. Where did this 42 cases go? Look at the subtotal for community cases btw 10th and 9th reports.the figure for 10-5 should be 1129+17 = 1146however it was reported as 11881188-1146 = 42So that shows to me that subtracted cases from the period between 10-5 to 27-4 of the situation report and put it in the before 27-Apr figures at the top of the table. This is the graph after the corrections are appliedThis is the graph before the corrections are appliedDo note that the 7 day average trend line of the chart with the amended figures shows a more pronounced lower trend line then when it's not corrected. Why is MOH amending the data in such a way to show a lower and more positive trend line? This shows to me how unreliable MOH's data are.

"Agree takes several hands to clap. How it is viewed is a big issue and why people not attracted to it. Will be long way ahead to change this.

Issue is gov brought this on themselves. If you are a worker unhappy with your workconditions you cant protest, you cant strike. The power-balance is skewed. This is formulated in the tripartism approach. Gov is leading that, Employers and employees are very weak in this power structure. If more power was in employers hands with empowered employees that may be a better approach as they could compete more and evolve naturally instead of what gov says.

In other countries this was one avenue in which productivity was improved. Workers demanded better pay and working conditions. Employers said ok i can give you that but then you need to be able to do this project with less people. Ok says the employee but i need a machine to accomplish that. Ok says the employer and so forth.
This dynamic doesnt exist in sg therefore so much of the burden ends up on gov.
Look at the security guards and cleaner sector. Gov actively intervened there to accomplish a better outcome. Leaving it to employers and employees nothing happened due to power imbalance.

Im not so antigov in general but when it comes to the cheap labor, looking down on blue collar work etc i think they are mistaken and outdated approach.",2020-05-03 21:44:05,reddit,agree takes several hands clap viewed big issue people not attracted long way ahead change issue gov brought unhappy workconditions cant protest cant strike power balance skewed formulated tripartism approach gov leading employers employees weak power structure power employers hands empowered employees may better approach could compete evolve naturally instead gov says countries one avenue productivity improved demanded better pay working conditions employers said ok give need able project less people ok says employee need machine accomplish ok says employer forth dynamic doesnt exist sg therefore much burden ends gov look security guards cleaner sector gov actively intervened accomplish better outcome leaving employers employees nothing happened due power imbalance im not antigov general comes cheap labor looking blue collar work etc think mistaken outdated approach

"National Development Minister Lawrence Wong conceded that the safeguards against COVID-19 in foreign worker dormitories were not sufficient, according to a CNBC report on Wednesday (6 May), in the frankest admission yet by a Singapore leader that the government dropped the ball on the issue.In an interview with CNBCs Squawk Box Asia, the co-chair of the multi-ministry taskforce on the coronavirus was asked by anchor Sri Jegarajah why the government had failed to identify these dorms, which house some 400,000 men across Singapore, as a potential area of infection risk.Wong responded by pointing out that the foreign worker clusters have occurred not just in the dormitories, but also in common work sites and gathering areas.Jegarajah then pressed Wong, But do you accept that conditions in those foreign worker dormitories were frankly appalling, frankly unhygienic, and this was an accident waiting to happen from a public health point of view? And if so, are those conditions going to change?Wong replied that the living environment in the dorms has been steadily improving over the years, stressing that the real issue was that they were designed for communal living.Nevertheless, he said, I think the lesson we've learnt from this experience is that with this pandemic, the unprecedented pandemic, the safeguards were not sufficient, and the design of the dormitories have to change.

"First, if you fundamentally disagree that resources (manpower, food, time, etc) have a limit, then why even bother commenting? I’m saying resources have a limit, in view of how much slower it is to coordinate cases and respond to other social problems. Whether you want to treat this as an argument of belief or fact, that’s up to you.

Second,as I’ve mentioned several times, there’s already resources allocated towards the welfare of migrant workers mistreated by errant employers. Since all of you in the NGOs and VWOs keep insisting not enough has been done, then how much resources are you calling for? 

From ST: “As of tuesday, prevalence of positive coronavirus cases in the community was 0.022 per cent, but it was 0.056 per cent among the 664,000 workers not living in dorms, and 2.2 per cent among the 323,000 foreign workers staying in dorms, which means 7,127 workers in dorms have the coronavirus.”

Are you saying ALL the workers in dorms are living in squalor? There’s examples in other threads that excellent dorms exist. So where’s your number about 200,000 from?

Third, there’s no possibility for any nation to be “covid free” until the world reaches a point where effective vaccines can be mass-manufactured.",2020-04-23 11:56:55,reddit,first fundamentally disagree resources manpower food time etc limit even bother commenting saying resources limit view much slower coordinate respond social problems whether want treat argument belief fact second mentioned several times already resources allocated towards welfare mistreated errant employers since ngos vwos keep insisting not enough done much resources calling st tuesday prevalence positive community 0 022 per cent 0 056 per cent among 664 000 not living 2 2 per cent among 323 000 staying means 7 127 saying living squalor examples threads excellent exist number 200 000 third no possibility nation free world reaches point effective vaccines mass manufactured

"That’s fascinating!

ETA Singapore once again  is in the position to contribute to worldwide understanding of the virus’ spread. The dorms are somewhat akin to DP, in that it’s a fairly closed system. 

A recent paper broke down categories of infectiousness by transmission route:
“Evidence exists for each of these routes of transmission: symptomatic (12), pre-symptomatic (13); asymptomatic (14); and environmental (12). For prevention, the crucial information is the relative frequency of different routes of transmission so as to allocate finite resources between different intervention strategies.”
The data that can be gleaned from the current crisis, given the impressive if not miraculous diligence in the Singaporeans’ response, will likely guide worldwide reopening of society building on this.

Their livelihoods here will hang in the balance even after COVID-19 has been eradicated here, say experts. (Photo: TODAY / Raj Nadarajan)By Ng Jun SenBy Justin Ong11 May 2020 06:28AM(Updated: 11 May 2020 06:30AM)SINGAPORE: Mr Syedur Rahman Liton, 34, pines for his wife back home in Dhaka, Bangladesh, as he tries to put on a brave front about possibly contracting COVID-19.For the past month or so, the lifting supervisor has been isolating himself along with 100 other company workers at a factory-converted dormitory in Senoko Loop, part of a precautionary move to socially distance migrant workers living in similar accommodation from the community at large to prevent the further spread of the novel coronavirus.It is a sacrifice that these foreign workers are making for the rest of Singapore society, experts say. As a result, the country owes migrant workers a debt of gratitude, and possibly, a concrete commitment to change when the pandemic is over. The number of COVID-19 cases has risen sharply from the first four infections detected at a foreign worker dormitory (S11 Dormitory at Seletar North Link) on Mar 30 which were part of 879 cases in total at that point in time, to 22,460 as of Saturday (May 9).Mr Liton has reason to be worried - two of his friends, Asit and Zakir, who live in the larger purpose-built dormitories, have been diagnosed with the disease and hospitalised.“We all want to go home in good health … My wife miss(es) me more and more,” he said.When asked about his prospects of remaining in Singapore in the foreseeable future amid the pandemic, Mr Liton said: “I don’t think (I worry) about the future, because I understand the situation.” But for the 400,000 migrant workers living in Singapore, their future could remain shrouded in uncertainty for some time. Their livelihoods here will hang in the balance even after COVID-19 has been eradicated in the Republic, experts said.Amid the crushing impact of the circuit breaker measures and the drastic blow to the construction industry, will Mr Liton’s employer survive the economic drought that has already started? Will he still have a job in post-pandemic Singapore?The Big Read - foreign workers in Singapore 2Medical workers attend to a migrant worker outside a factory-converted dormitory in Sungei Kadut, April 28, 2020. (Photo: TODAY / Raj Nadarajan)While Mr Liton ponders over the future, his host country - Singapore - will also have to reassess its whole relationship with migrant workers like him, especially its “addiction” to cheap migrant labour, and examine whether the lessons learnt from the explosion of COVID-19 cases in the workers’ dormitories could be used to implement meaningful changes. In the near- to medium-term, at least, what is likely to happen will be a reduction of migrant workers here as economic conditions worsen, said labour economist Walter Theseira.“At the same time, having fewer migrant workers means more room to make changes,” said the associate professor at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.With the renewed national attention on migrant workers, the Government has pledged to raise living standards in dormitories when the battle against COVID-19 is over.Already, there are some suggestions on what these changes can be, from having more living space per worker, more dormitories to house them, and tightening state regulations. Over the years, Singapore’s history with migrant worker accommodation has seen a general apprehension towards housing migrant workers in the residential community.In 2008, more than 1,400 Serangoon Gardens residents signed a petition against a dormitory situated in their neighbourhood, which they handed to then National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan.But beyond the dormitories, there are also wider questions to consider, said the experts. Should society start questioning its reliance on low-cost foreign workers? Will the economy be able to cope with increased costs of raised standards? Can people accept migrant workers living in their midst?For some insights into these issues, we reached out to various stakeholders in the industry of migrant labour, such as dormitory operators, construction firms, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), as well as labour academics and policy researchers. Ultimately, nearly all those interviewed said a significant relook at how Singapore accommodates its migrant workforce, both in the literal and figurative sense, is overdue. Mr Christopher Gee, senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), said: “We can’t go back to the status quo ... We have ridden on our luck for so long and now it has come home to roost.”THE STATUS QUOThere are about 200,000 migrant workers housed in 43 purpose-built dormitories around Singapore.These are licensed dormitories housing more than 1,000 workers each and are required to comply with the requirements under the Foreign Employee Dormitory Act (FEDA), such as providing facilities that include sick bays and isolation rooms.Dormitory operators are also required to draw contingency plans in case of a pandemic, such as providing arrangements for quarantine.Despite this, around 20 of the purpose-built dormitories - nearly half - flout the FEDA licensing requirement on average each year, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo revealed in Parliament on Monday (May 4). Operators face fines of up to S$50,000 and up to a year in jail for Feda offences.Another 95,000 workers are housed in the 1,200 factory-converted dormitories; 20,000 in construction temporary quarters; and 85,000 work permit and S Pass holders in the construction sector housed in Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats, private residential premises and others.These are not covered under the FEDA due to their smaller size, though they have to comply with other regulations such as the building and fire safety codes.Each purpose-built dormitory house anywhere between 1,500 and 25,000 workers. By law, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) prescribes a minimum of 4.5 sq m per dorm resident for living space, which includes the sleeping quarters, kitchen, dining and toilet areas. Operators have largely kept to these minimum standards, as well as other environmental health guidelines by the National Environment Agency that states that there should be one toilet facility for every 15 residents. Each room can house between 12 and 20 workers, and the beds are often double-decked.OPERATORS: DORMS NOT BUILT FOR A PANDEMICWhile the purpose-built dormitories have met the needs of the workers during “normal times”, dorm operators said these large facilities were not built nor regulated to cater for a pandemic of such a scale.A spokesperson from Mini Environment Service (MES), which oversees operations at Jurong Penjuru Dorm 1, Jurong Penjuru Dorm 2, Blue Stars Dorm and The Leo, added that a dormitory “by nature is dense”. “The older specifications and designs of a dormitory were based on a functional approach and pandemic management was not a consideration in the design and use,” the spokesperson added.Managing Director of S11 Dormitories Johnathan Cheah said that the dormitories under his charge - S11 Dormitory @ Punggol and Changi Lodge II - are organised to accommodate residents who fall ill with infectious diseases such as chicken pox, measles and mumps.   “(The dormitories) were not designed to accommodate the large number (of infected cases) expected during a pandemic,” he said.As of Friday, S11 Dormitory @ Punggol is Singapore’s biggest infection cluster, with 2,535 cases. When asked how the living space each worker has is allotted, the dorm operators said that this is largely up to the specifications of the authorities. Mr Cheah said that S11 Dormitory @ Punggol was “built to the authorities' specifications for dormitories” when constructed in 2015.   Agreeing, the MES spokesperson said: “We don’t get to decide on the living space. This is set by the authorities and the dormitories are built to specifications.” HELP FROM AUTHORITIESAs infections in dorm clusters began to rise early last month, an inter-agency task force was set up on Apr 7 to provide support to foreign workers and dormitory employers. With help from the authorities, operators have been able to lower occupancy rates within the dormitories. Mr Kong Chee Min, the chief executive officer of Centurion Corporation, who is in charge of ASPRI-Westlite Papan, Westlite Juniper, Westlite Mandai, Westlite Toh Guan and Westlite Woodlands, said that the leased tenancy of these dorms averaged 95 per cent or higher, while the actual residency was around 85 per cent.

(Photo: TODAY / Raj Nadarajan)Thanks to the “concerted decamping efforts supported by multiple parties nationally” in the wake of the pandemic, occupancy has been brought down to about 65 to 70 per cent on average. “On average, there are now about five or six persons living in an eight-bed apartment, and eight to nine persons in a 12-bed apartment,” said Mr Kong. Likewise, the operator at S11 Dormitory @ Punggol has been “working very closely” with the authorities to curb the spread of the virus. For example, the residents are required to stay in their assigned rooms and cannot come into contact with the other residents in different levels and blocks. This measure is part of a three-pronged strategy announced by Manpower Minister Teo on Apr 14. FUTURE HOPES FOR DORMSThe operators hope that the next couple of years will bring improvements to the conditions and living standards within the dormitories. “A review of standards for dormitory operations can only be good for the foreign worker community as it will help to raise quality levels across the industry,” said Mr Kong. Agreeing, the MES spokesperson said that the ability to “tear down” the dormitories with older specifications and update them will “benefit all stakeholders”.The issues which the operators would like to address include the long-standing conundrum of safe distancing.  “If we are to prepare for future pandemic situations, the density of the dorm population needs to be addressed and employers need to set aside higher budgets for rentals, for instance,” said Mr Cheah of S11 Dormitories. Beyond deciding where to house the workers, employers also play a “major role” in regulating the way employees use the premises, operators say.Mr Kong said: “We do see employers who rent 12-bed apartment units, then choose to house only 10 or less workers in the apartment.”EMPLOYERS: ""OUR HANDS ARE TIED""While migrant workers are covered by Singapore’s main labour law, the Employment Act, employers of migrant workers also generally assume a greater responsibility for their welfare, including food accommodation and healthcare, than if they had hired a local resident to do the same job.But while employers in the construction sector agree that changes to how migrant workers are housed are needed, several said the influence they have on their workers’ living conditions is limited. It is largely not up to the employers to dictate the density or the living conditions within the dormitories, but for the operators to decide and the authorities to regulate, they claimed.  Mr Johnny Lim, executive director of Teambuild Engineering & Construction, noted that purpose-built dormitories are often densely populated due to the shortage of land and “concerns that these dormitories are in too close proximity to residential areas”.Mr Chew Char Choon, senior project manager of a real estate construction firm, said: “As a contractor or dorm operator, we just take instructions from (the authorities) ... It is up to the Government, how they would like to control.” READ: COVID-19: Crowding, emotional health of migrant workers at dormitories concern employersWhile maximum room capacity and space for each worker may be set by the operators with prevailing regulations in mind, some employers may choose to house their workers in more spacious environs - but at a cost. Mr Nelson Tee, managing director of CHH Construction System, has been housing his 39 workers in three dormitory rooms that can hold a total of 48 workers.  He pays S$369 per worker monthly for their accommodation when he could have been paying S$300 had he housed them to full capacity, and has been doing so before the pandemic. “I book them for three rooms so I can spread them out,” he said.MORE SPACE WILL COME AT A COSTShould new guidelines cause housing to be more costly, not all contractors may be able to stomach this, the employers said. This is especially if they have long-term projects underway, some of which can last four to five years. Mr Chew said that should dormitories charge higher rates per worker, it would “not be fair to ongoing contracts, which are tendered based on old pricing”. “When the new guidelines come in… it will affect (employers’) cashflow.” At the end of the day, some employers think it boils down to who would be willing to shoulder and split the extra costs. Mr Akbar Kader, managing director of Nan Guan Construction, said that he would like to see a “symbiotic arrangement” between the employer, dormitory operators, and the authorities, such that the extra costs are fairly distributed among them.  He added that a maximum rental charge would also make future operators more mindful during the tendering process - when they bid for the price of land on which to build their dormitories.   Exorbitant bids will be fewer if operators “know that they would have to provide specified facilities and meet operational requirements, and charge no more than what has been stipulated as the (maximum) price for rental of a bed space”, he said. If all the above is carried out, “the increment in cost (to the consumers) over the time they own the property will be very minute”, said Mr Akbar.  Some employers think that consumers should also see beyond the economic cost of the product and be mindful of the workers’ efforts that go behind it.Mr Kenneth Loo, executive director of Straits Construction Singapore, said that most Singaporeans are not aware of the workers’ hard work, and the tough living conditions they have to put up with.“How much people are willing to pay depends on the economy (rather than the workers’ living conditions),” he said. “For example, when you buy a piece of clothing, do you think of where it comes from? No, right?” The Big Read - foreign workers in Singapore 4An empty room at Westlite Papan dormitory on Apr 21, 2020, after workers in essential services were moved out. (Photo: TODAY / Nuria Ling)A PUSH TOWARDS AUTOMATIONOver the years, some employers have also turned to technology to help reduce their reliance on foreign labour. For example, Mr Lim from Teambuild Engineering & Construction said the firm focuses on prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction (PPVC), whereby entire rooms are first prefinished and fitted out in factories with the use of automation and machinery, before being transported on-site for assembly. These new construction methods “effectively transferred major portions of the work previously carried out on the construction sites into the factories”, he said.However, there is a limit to automation. Unless technological advancement allows machines to “function like tradesmen” and be available, accessible and affordable, “construction will remain a labour-intensive industry”, Mr Lim said. While both dorm operators and employers say their hands are tied when it comes to housing, commentaries over the past several weeks have jointly blamed the inadequacies by both parties for the outbreak.Experts say the time will come for a review to identify where the lapses are.Assoc Prof Theseira said: “Employers and operators are quite a diverse group. Some appear to have neglected their responsibilities, others have simply been overwhelmed, and others still have discharged their responsibilities well. We really need some time to identify who did well and who didn't, and hold those who failed to account.”GOVERNMENT: ROLE AS REGULATORAs the authorities hunker down to mitigate the viral spread, the Government is also looking into new housing arrangements for migrant workers who have recovered from COVID-19 through a pipeline of short, medium and long-term plans, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong.Mr Wong co-chairs the multi-ministry task force leading Singapore’s response to the COVID-19 outbreak.While details of these plans are not yet known, several suggestions have been raised, most notably, to increase the minimum standard for living space specified in FEDA.After all, it is too much to expect private operators and employers to do so on their own, said Mr Alex Au, vice-president of migrant worker rights group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2).“Employers and dorm operators have to watch their bottom lines. They are not welfare services. If the legal standards are low - which we feel they are currently - they would be foolish as profit-making enterprises to over-provide and drive up their own costs. “That's what the Government is for - to ensure socially-conscious minimum standards, but to do so in an across-the-board way so that a level-playing field for all businesses is maintained,” he said.Mr Au called for a doubling of the living space per occupant to 9 square metres - equivalent to 10 workers living in a four-room HDB flat.Assoc Prof Theseira, a Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP), said a proper study is needed to determine what construes a reasonable standard for living space. “If we come up with one set of standards for living for Singaporeans in a similar situation, for example, a long-term hostel, dormitory, or army camp residents, it would be quite unjust to apply a lower standard to migrant workers just because they are migrant workers,” he said.The Migrant Workers’ Centre (MWC) also urged for changes to the FEDA to include all migrant worker housing facilities regardless of their size or type, stripping away the 1,000-bed threshold which allows the law to kick in. Said MWC chairman and former Member of Parliament Yeo Guat Kwang: “This is something MWC has been calling for since the enactment of FEDA, on the evidence that the majority of the sub-par housing facilities we see and investigate in the course of work continue to come from factory-converted, or smaller dormitory facilities.”Other suggestions from MWC include a minimum dormitory staff to residents ratio, so as to ensure that operators have sufficient manpower to carry out crucial work such as cleaning, operations support and security. More open green space should also be part of the dormitory requirements, which would allow for recreation and communal activities.Labour economist Kelvin Seah from the National University of Singapore’s (NUS) Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences said that these plans should include strategies to raise the hygiene standard in dormitories.“For instance, the plan may want to prescribe the regularity in which toilets, kitchens, and rooms would be cleaned, and the sanctions which dorm operators or employers may face if they fail to comply,” said the senior lecturer.But these suggestions would likely lead to substantially higher costs of housing migrant workers, added Dr Seah. DBS bank analyst Ling Lee Keng, who frequently reports on the commercial performance of the purpose-built workers accommodation sector, said that a more stringent law could result in a cutback in the supply of beds.“That could benefit the dormitory operators that are able to meet the higher operating requirements - bigger rooms and better facilities would naturally lead to higher cost per bed,” said the analyst, who had previously predicted that raised standards could lead to a consolidation in the industry.A MORE DIRECT ROLE FOR THE GOVERNMENTAside from regulations, could the Government also play a more active role in dormitory management?Speaking at an IPS webinar on Wednesday, Associate Professor Jeremy Lim, who is the co-director of Global Health at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS, noted the existence of two separate “mental models” that the authorities had for migrant workers and for the larger Singapore community.The policy response was guided by these mental models, that although migrant workers are part of the community, there are separate paradigms for the two groups, he said.READ: COVID-19: 'Not true' Singapore has reduced testing among migrant workers, says Gan Kim YongEmployers of migrant workers assume the responsibility for the workers’ welfare, including healthcare, accommodation and food. Assoc Prof Lim said this is evident from the onset of the pandemic when the MOM asked dormitory operators to step up hygiene measures and issued advisories to employers.“As it became clear that employers were overwhelmed in terms of safe distancing and (providing) face masks, everything fell apart and the Government had to step in. To their credit, the Government mentally pivoted away from this mental model … quickly,” he said, noting the speedy establishment of community care and recovery facilities to house affected workers.Several observers had mixed feelings about the Government playing a more direct role in day-to-day dormitory management. Such services are best provided by the private market, said Dr Seah.But the Government could also take a leaf from the book for public transport operators which do not own the buses and trains, or from how the management of state-owned buildings are tendered out to commercial service providers.Assoc Prof Theseira said: “Having dormitories owned by the Government, and then managed on a competitive basis by private companies accountable both to workers and the Government, may be an interesting model to consider.”TWEAKING SINGAPORE'S ECONOMIC MODELA more fundamental question would be whether Singapore should continue to rely heavily on low-cost migrant workers, said experts.In Singapore, past crises have historically led to a rethinking of the Republic’s social compact - the combined series of unprecedented crises such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001, the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the global financial crisis of 2008 required national responses that “threw our planning out of gear” and necessitated the 2013 Population White Paper, said then Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean.With Singapore now facing what has been touted as  “a crisis of a generation”, some, like Assoc Prof Theseira and fellow NMP Anthea Ong, have called for a committee of inquiry into the foreign worker dormitory outbreak to work out the structural changes that Singapore sorely needs.In his reply to the NMPs’ call, Minister Wong told Parliament on Monday that the Government will review its overall response to the pandemic comprehensively in order to learn and improve.Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has also set up an Emerging Stronger Task Force, which is tasked with making recommendations on how to reimagine Singapore’s economic strategies.One silver lining, from a policymaking perspective, is that the current worries about Singapore’s overreliance on migrant workers are aligned with the Government’s goal of raising the productivity of the resident workforce.This dates back to 2012, when then Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said the easy availability of foreign labour will reduce the incentives for companies to raise productivity. Since then, Singapore has taken steps to progressively reduce this reliance, such as tightening the foreign worker dependency ratio ceilings, said Dr Seah.“There is scope to reduce this reliance even further. By encouraging companies to rely less on foreign labour in their production processes, we can in fact nudge them to adopt smarter and less costly methods of production,” he added.Associate Professor Kenneth Paul Tan, from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, said he hopes the review on dormitories, when it comes, will take in diverse voices from civil society in policy discussions.“And I hope, most of all, that we have deeper discussions with a view to minimising our dependency on low-waged migrant workers, investing in productivity-enhancing technology, redesigning essential jobs to overcome unnecessary stigma, and designing more generous social safety nets for the many who will have difficulty integrating into a new and more resilient economic society.”PEOPLE: SOCIETY’S APPETITE FOR CHANGEIPS’ Mr Gee said that this traditional mindset of relying on lower-skilled and low-wage labour has created a “category of residents who have limited rights as a non-permanent resident foreigner and are treated differently”.If Singapore decides that in a post-pandemic world, it needs to elevate their living standards to a decent level that Singaporeans can accept for themselves, then another question will be what level would Singaporeans be comfortable with, said Mr Gee. “The same level as the lowest-paid Singaporean household? Or lesser? We have to negotiate and discuss this,” he said.And then, there is also the matter of cost that society needs to bear.READ: MOM says working to improve conditions for S11 Dormitory, Westlite Toh Guan residentsLast month, amid the outbreak in the dormitories, Mrs Teo said that each time MOM attempts to raise the standard of living in these premises, it would face objections from employers due to the added costs that come with the move.“Nevertheless, I hope the COVID-19 episode demonstrates to the employers and wider public that raising standards at worker dormitories is not only the right thing to do but also in our own interests. We should be willing to accept the higher costs that come with higher standards,” she said. In this fundamental re-think of the role migrant workers play in Singapore’s prosperity, TWC2’s Mr Au urged the authorities to also look beyond living standards in dormitories, such as long-standing issues on the recruitment fees that migrant workers bear and the non-payment of salaries.Assoc Prof Theseira said: “Fundamentally, the current structure is low-cost, and as a result, generally Singaporeans benefit in the narrow sense that we pay lower prices for anything produced by foreign workers.”“Either our costs would go up, meaning more taxation, or standards would fall, meaning more potholes, uncleared fallen trees, et cetera, without so many low-cost workers. “That means that we have collectively contributed to current conditions for foreign workers, because we have found these low costs and high standards of service too compelling to raise too many questions about their treatment and the market structure,” he added.SINGAPORE ATTITUDES TOWARDS MIGRANT WORKERSSo, are Singaporeans willing to pay for the higher costs that will inevitably arise from offering migrant workers a better deal? The jury is still out, based on past experience, according to the experts interviewed. The empirical evidence suggests that the mindset of Singaporeans towards migrant workers has not changed, despite an outpouring of sympathy whenever a major incident occurred.At the IPS webinar, MWC executive director Bernard Menon lamented that despite past events such as the SMRT bus driver strike in 2012 and the Little India riot the following year, the momentum arising from the online discourses on worker welfare would eventually peter out.“We have a lot of people coming up and saying ‘you should improve this, you should improve that’,” said Mr Menon.“But unfortunately, though you can obviously tell that there’s been a gradual increase over time of interest and concern … this has lagged behind the expectations I’ve had during these crises.” Most recently, in December last year, the International Labour Organization and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women jointly published a detailed study into society attitudes towards migrant labour in Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. The study included both work permit holders working in the construction industry and foreign domestic workers as part of their report.It found that overall support for migrant workers had decreased in the past nine years, when a similar study was conducted in 2010. “Knowledge regarding migrant workers across the four countries remains low, and discriminatory attitudes prevail with significant numbers of members of the public in migrant destination countries stating that migrant workers should not enjoy equal working conditions with nationals,” the report stated.The study found that 36 per cent of the 1,005 Singapore respondents believed migrant workers should not receive the same work conditions as local workers, or be entitled to join a union. Around 40 per cent said migrant workers who end up exploited only have themselves to blame, a majority - 60 per cent - disagree that migrant workers should receive the same pay and benefits as nationals, and 53 per cent said migrant workers threaten the country’s culture and heritage.Nevertheless, a majority of the Singaporean respondents (58 per cent) recognised that migrant workers had a net positive effect on Singapore’s national economy.A ROUND OF SOUL-SEARCHINGWith the pandemic forcing Singapore - as a collective - to pay the price for years of apparent neglect, commentators said that after COVID-19 is eliminated, Singapore needs to openly embark on some serious soul-searching.For a start, the society’s mindset and attitude towards migrant workers need to “undergo a sea change”, said Associate Professor Eugene Tan from the Singapore Management University.“SG United must include migrant workers from the get-go ... We cannot, as a society, seek to harness the benefits of their being here and yet not prepare to bear the costs of their being in our midst. We cannot continue to have the gains privatised but the costs socialised in our migrant worker policy,” the law don said.As Singapore figures out its next steps for migrant workers, the workers are also trying to figure out theirs as they mill around in their rooms within the various dormitories dotting Singapore keeping a distance from everyone else.The Big Read - foreign workers in Singapore 5Mr Syedur Rahman Liton and his friend Asit at a poetry event in Singapore in 2017.

"You need to pay closer attention to context. What do you think people are ticked off about?

The PAP and media outlets are out in full force, insisting that they could not have foreseen the explosion in the migrant worker dorms. The actual facts are that, due to a publicly published letter, at least as of 23 March, they must have known about the potential. We know that the way things work in Singapore, issues are floated up privately first, so it is very likely that the PAP was informed earlier on. And even if they were not informed, the elite ruling class that is amongst the most highly paid leaders in the world because they themselves say they need to be the most highly paid in order to attract the best talent, *that* ruling class ought to have known. 

Instead, we get a whole lot of waffling about how this was only foreseeable in hindsight. This is what Josephine Teo [said](-teams-in-place-at-all-43-dormitories-to-tackle-situation): 

> Replying to a reporter's question on whether anything could have been done to avoid having to quarantine thousands of workers, Mrs Teo said ""it is not as if we have not done anything"" to manage the situation in dormitories.

> She recalled how stay-home notices and entry approval for workers returning from China were implemented in January and February, with inspections to make sure they obeyed the rules.

> On the decision to quarantine workers, she said: ""Given the scale and the complexity of the operations, it was never going to be a trivial decision to implement these measures, where the evidence did not previously suggest they were necessary.""

Set aside the callous, defensive, don't-blame-me attitude behind ""it is not as if we have not done anything"". 

You know what the ""standard of evidence"" was, by end February? We strongly, strongly suspected that the covid virus spreads pre- and a-symptomatically. We *knew* that some people with the disease presented with very mild symptoms. We knew that foreign workers were impacted and were being discouraged from reporting sick, because there was a directive requiring doctors to issue 5-day mandatory MC for URTI symptoms, and if your MC entitlement runs out you don't get paid. This is even without considering the kind of pressure that companies put on foreign workers to exploit them further. 

Knowing all of this, what could we have done more? 

The PAP's answer is ""it is not as if we have not done anything"". 

I do not accept this standard of governance. 

I don't even care if the PAP does not apologise. Apologising is never about saying the words ""I'm sorry"". Apologising is about, step 1, acknowledging that you have done wrong. We can't even get past this hump because The PAP Does No Wrong. 

That's why you see emotive memes like ""there is no war in ba sing se"" and ""say sorry"". They all come from a place of genuine discomfort at how the PAP handles things. Look at [this thread](/), you can see where some of these objections are rooted. 

I say all of this as someone who votes PAP and who is very likely to vote PAP in the upcoming election, and who thinks the PAP has generally done a good job in this crisis.",2020-05-08 18:53:48,reddit,need pay closer attention context think people ticked pap media outlets full force insisting could not foreseen explosion actual facts due publicly published letter least 23 march must known potential know way things work singapore issues floated privately first likely pap informed earlier even not informed elite ruling class amongst highly paid leaders world say need highly paid order attract best talent ruling class ought known instead get whole lot waffling foreseeable hindsight josephine teo said teams place 43 tackle situation replying reporter question whether anything could done avoid quarantine thousands mrs teo said not not done anything manage situation recalled stay home notices entry approval returning china implemented january february inspections make sure obeyed rules decision quarantine said given scale complexity operations never going trivial decision implement measures evidence not previously suggest necessary set aside callous defensive blame attitude behind not not done anything know standard evidence end february strongly strongly suspected spreads pre symptomatically knew people disease presented mild symptoms knew impacted discouraged reporting sick directive requiring doctors issue 5 day mandatory mc urti symptoms mc entitlement runs get paid even without considering kind pressure companies put exploit knowing could done pap answer not not done anything not accept standard governance even care pap not apologise apologising never saying words sorry apologising step 1 acknowledging done wrong even get past hump pap no wrong see emotive memes like no war ba sing se say sorry come place genuine discomfort pap handles things look thread see objections rooted say someone votes pap likely vote pap upcoming election thinks pap generally done good job crisis

"> # 573 new coronavirus cases in Singapore to bring total to 18,778

> SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed 573 new Covid-19 cases as of Monday noon (May 4), taking the country's total count to 18,778.

> Among these are five Singaporeans and permanent residents, while migrant workers living in dormitories continue to make up the bulk of the remaining cases.

> More details will be released later on Monday, the ministry said.

> Over the weekend, the Government announced plans to ease some of the tighter restrictions put in place during Singapore's circuit breaker, but said that these measures - which were due to end on Monday - will continue for another week.

> Some businesses, such as barbers, home-based businesses and laundry services, will be allowed to progressively open from May 12, although they still have to abide by precautions put in place earlier. For instance, hairdressers can offer only haircuts.

> This comes as some governments across the world begin or mull over plans to ease curbs in order to restart their economies, amid concerns that such moves could backfire and cause spikes in virus cases.

> Portugal, for instance, ended its state of emergency over the weekend, while Spain is allowing restaurants to reopen for takeaways and adults to exercise on the streets.

> Singapore's Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said on Saturday that the country has to adapt and adjust its solutions ""cautiously and gradually"".

> ""And as we do this, we need everyone to cooperate, so that we can open up the economy and resume normal activities safely without causing further clusters to form,"" he said at a multi-ministry task force briefing.

> There were 657 new coronavirus cases on Sunday.

> MOH said 15,833 of the 323,000 migrant workers living in dormitories - 4.9 per cent - have tested positive for the virus. In contrast, 569 migrant workers not living in dorms, as well as 1,224 Singaporeans and permanent residents, have been diagnosed with the virus.

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> The virus prevalence rates for migrant workers not living in dorms, and that for Singaporeans and permanent residents, are 0.09 per cent and 0.03 per cent respectively.

> MOH said on Sunday that new community cases among Singaporeans and PRs, as well as long-term pass and work pass holders, fell from an average of 21 daily cases two weeks ago to 11 in the past week. This excludes work permit holders who are not living in dormitories.

> The number of unlinked cases from this group has also dropped from a daily average of 13 to five over the same period.

> As of Sunday, 1,404 patients in Singapore have fully recovered from the virus and been discharged.

> Eighteen people have died from Covid-19 complications and four who tested positive have died from other causes.

> Globally, the outbreak, which began in December last year, has infected about 3.5 million people. About a quarter of a million people have died.

> The United States is the worst affected country in the world with more than 1.1 million cases and 66,000 deaths from Covid-19 as of Monday.

"> # Coronavirus: Mustafa Centre believed to be starting point for hundreds of cases

> Mustafa Centre is believed to have been the starting point for hundreds of coronavirus infections at foreign worker dormitories, said the Health Ministry's director of medical services Kenneth Mak yesterday.

> The workers are likely to have been infected after visiting the shopping mall, where some employees had fallen ill. They transmitted the infection to their co-workers, who then infected others at their dormitories.

> Preliminary investigations have linked the Mustafa Centre cluster to clusters at the construction site at Project Glory and five dormitories, Associate Professor Mak said.

> These are S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, Tampines Dormitory, Toh Guan Dormitory, Sungei Tengah Lodge and Cochrane Lodge II.

> The majority of yesterday's 287 new cases were linked to foreign worker dormitories.

> Thousands of healthy workers are being moved to locations such as army camps and floating hotels, and the Government has started to actively screen and test workers for the disease.

> Four dormitories have also been gazetted as isolation areas.

> At a press conference yesterday, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo was asked if anything could have been done to avoid having to quarantine thousands of foreign workers.

> In response, she said the Government had taken steps since the start of the outbreak to engage dormitory operators and break up large gatherings of foreign workers.

> Related Story Coronavirus: Sungei Tengah Lodge is 4th foreign worker dorm gazetted as isolation area

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> ""It is not as if we have not done anything to try and manage the situation at the dorms,"" Mrs Teo added, noting that there have been no clusters in dormitories until only recently, even though a number of foreign workers had tested positive for the virus.

> ""Within dorms, workers interact with each other very regularly, very closely - they're like family, so the risk of transmission was always there,"" she said.

> Preventing clusters at dormitories would have required drastic measures involving the closure of work sites and malls, and were not easy decisions to make when the evidence at that time did not suggest they were necessary, Mrs Teo said.

> ""We couldn't have so easily said: 'Well, let's do it', when there were no similar occurrences of the clusters that we see today,"" she added. ""It's not a button that you press easily, and it is a non-trivial decision to make.""

> National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said: ""If I had known, of course, I would have done things differently - but no one can tell the next step.

> ""The reality is no one will know... if one case can very quickly spread into a cluster.""

> At present, the Government's priority is to contain the spread in dormitories for foreign workers while ensuring that their welfare is looked after, he said.

> At yesterday's press conference, Mr Wong also stressed that the disease is not a ""foreign worker issue"" and that any individual can be a weak link if he does not comply with safe distancing measures.

> ""One lapse can result in a cluster forming, so all of us have to do our part to stabilise the situation and keep it under control,"" he said.

> ""We have a responsibility for these foreign workers who have come all the way here, at considerable expense, to make a living in Singapore. So we will do our part, and we will do our very best to take care of them, and ensure their safety and their well-being.""

And most of those were not even close contacts of those infected but a “sweep” through and across the dorms. If you catch the vibe, it means for the workers in the 43 dorms, should we mass test all of them, we can safely assume at least 10% of them would be infected and this means 50,000 workers at least. We are still sweeping though the domes now, but 3000 is the number of tests we can conduct daily, but how many foreign workers do we have? Around 1 million.

"These 2 things are not mutually exclusive. Singapore can be increasing testing on foreign workers as a whole (what Gan Kim Yong said), and also not testing symptomatic foreign workers in dormitories with high number of infected cases. 

If they have found that specific dormitories have such a high rate of infected that there is a very high chance that anybody who is symptomatic has the disease, it makes sense to not spend the resource to test this patient and just treat them as if they had the disease. So instead of using 1 test on this patient (net testing =1), they now use 0 test on him, and 2 tests on asymptomatic foreign workers in this dorm or other dorms (net testing = 2). So both reports would be right. 

Numbers are important, but the most important number is the number of deaths. We want these people to be healthy and alive.",2020-04-28 15:52:48,reddit,2 things not mutually exclusive singapore increasing testing whole gan kim yong said also not testing symptomatic high number infected found specific high rate infected high chance anybody symptomatic disease makes sense not spend resource test patient treat disease instead using 1 test patient net testing 1 use 0 test 2 tests asymptomatic net testing 2 reports would right numbers important important number number deaths want people healthy alive

"> # Coronavirus: Letter on dorm cases xenophobic, says Shanmugam

> A forum letter published in Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao that linked the Covid-19 outbreak in dormitories to foreign workers' personal hygiene and living habits showed racism and deep insensitivity, Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam said yesterday.

> The letter, published on Tuesday, also showed a lack of understanding of why there has been Covid-19 transmission in Singapore's foreign worker population, he added.

> While the average number of cases in the local community has stayed stable in recent days, the number of cases in dormitories has soared to the hundreds and now forms the majority of new cases.

> This is primarily due to communal living and is not just a question of personal habits, Mr Shanmugam told Zaobao.

> ""Personal habits are extremely important: washing of hands, keeping yourself clean,"" he said.

> ""But when you put people together, when they sleep in the same room, they cook together and they are in close proximity over a long period of time, of course there will be high levels of transmission, just like we know (there are) also transmissions in households.""

> Instead of pointing fingers, Singaporeans should be coming together to take care of the foreign workers here, he added, as he credited them for helping to build Singapore's Housing Board flats and infrastructure and keeping the country clean.

> ""Our duty as Singaporeans, really, is to show them empathy and take care of them,"" he said. ""I don't think this is the time to say it is their own fault.""

> He noted the Singapore community has mobilised to help foreign workers here, while the Government has stepped in to ensure they continue to receive their salaries, medical care and daily meals.

> ""All of these gestures - I'm not sure that many other countries are doing it - are really to assure the foreign workers that they are not just locked down in their dorms and left there to fend for themselves without any idea of what's going to happen to them,"" he said.

> ""That's not the way.""

> In the letter, forum writer Lee Shiwan had asked if foreign workers should not themselves be held responsible for the outbreak in the dormitories, given that they ""like to gather and do not pay attention to personal hygiene"".

> Ms Lee had also said many foreign workers came from backward countries and brought with them ""habits such as eating with their hands and eating under trees"".

> Lianhe Zaobao said in a statement that its letters pages publish a diversity of views, and the opinions of contributors do not represent the newspaper's position.

> A day before publishing the letter, the newspaper ran stories about the conditions of foreign worker dormitories here and the need to include them in the battle against Covid-19, said Zaobao's forum editor Yap Pheng Hui.

> ""The intention of Zaobao in publishing the (letter) was to present a differing opinion so readers would be able to appreciate the diversity of viewpoints in society,"" he said.

> Mr Yap noted that most of the letters the newspaper has received to date were against the position taken by Ms Lee, and have ""provided well-reasoned rebuttals against the position put forth in the original article"". The original letter had thus allowed for robust debates and allowed ""a wider audience to reflect upon and understand the impact of the pandemic"".

> Related Story Rajinikath, Sachin Tendulkar share messages of encouragement for foreign workers in Singapore

> ""Zaobao believes that it is through the diverse mediums of readers' letters, opinion pieces and investigative pieces by journalists that our society draws ever closer to the truth,"" he said.

> Mr Shanmugam, who found the letter xenophobic, stressed it is possible for 57 per cent of Singaporeans to be professionals, managers, executives and technicians, or PMETs, because foreign workers form the base of the economy.

> They, therefore, help build Singapore's prosperity and should be better appreciated, he said.

> He also said Singaporeans are kind, compassionate and generous people. ""We are bigger than the sentiments expressed in that letter.""

"Basically, if FWs present respiratory pneumonia like symptoms, they would be deemed to have been clinically diagnosed to have COVID-19 and prolly treated symptomatically for it. But, as the news report on CNA had put it (on Saturday), this means that possibly hundred of such cases would have been left out because, being clinically diagnosed does not equal confirmed, hence these possibly infected cases would not be included in the daily tally of confirmed cases. It does not mean no more testing is done in the dorms, there're tests still being run, but if FWs have aforementioned symptoms of respiratory pneumonia, they are assumed to have COVID-19 and may be tested later as treatment comes first. I guess it's a way to simplify diagnosis and to assign treatment as priority, but it leaves out a large number of possible confirmed infections.

"\[opinion\] Yesterday, I discussed [my interpretation of ""backlog cases]()"". I think that ""backlog cases"" consist of the suspect cases of people who are staying in dorms which have known infections.

* PUQs pending quarantine location : 1286
* PUQs being transferred to hospital : 310
* PUQs in non-Gazetted Dorms : 17436
* PUQs in Gazetted Dorms : 319
* PUQs in Government Quarantine Facility : 9184
* PUQs in Home Quarantine Order : 592

I am guessing these numbers are indication of the number of ""backlog cases"" (suspect cases).  As QOs are issued everyday due to new cases, the total PUQs will never drop to 0.

Instead of 0, when the number of PUQs drop to less than 10000 (early April levels), then we would have cleared this ""backlog"".",2020-05-10 16:26:33,reddit,opinion yesterday discussed interpretation backlog think backlog consist suspect people staying known infections noticed shn qo tab site still big number active number persons quarantine puq may 9 puqs pending quarantine location 1286 puqs transferred hospital 310 puqs non gazetted 17436 puqs gazetted 319 puqs government quarantine facility 9184 puqs home quarantine order 592 guessing numbers indication number backlog suspect qos issued everyday due new total puqs never drop 0 instead 0 number puqs drop less 10000 early april levels would cleared backlog

"Some foreign workers who have recovered from COVID-19 in Singapore will be temporarily housed on two SuperStar cruise ships, Genting Cruise Lines said on Friday (May 1).SuperStar Gemini and SuperStar Aquarius have ""completed stringent evaluation checks"" by the Government and will provide accommodation for the workers, it said in a press release.The number of COVID-19 cases among migrant workers living in dormitories has surged in recent weeks, and now make up about 85 per cent of Singapore's 16,169 cases.Many workers who are well have been moved out of the tightly packed dormitories to other living quarters, such as military camps and vacant HDB flats.On Apr 27, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said that authorities have an ""extensive"" plan to house recovered foreign migrant workers, involving new sites.Earlier, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) had said that the two cruise ships were being assessed as they have readily available rooms and en-suite toilets to minimise person-to-person contact.The assessment considered factors such as the ship’s ventilation systems, security protocols and infection control measures, said STB. The two ships together can accommodate up to 2,000 foreign workers.""Every effort will be made to uphold the health and welfare of Singapore’s foreign workers while on board the ship, which include observing the highest standards of safe distancing and preventive measures at all timess,"" said Genting Cruise Lines.“We are pleased that our on board facilities, as well as preventive and safety standards meet Singapore’s strict requirements for this initiative,"" said Mr Michael Goh, president of Dream Cruises, adding that there have been no reported cases of COVID-19 among its guests or crew to date.The SuperStar Gemini arrived on Apr 17 from Hong Kong, and is berthed at Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore.

"Deathly opposed to everything the original (pre-translation) article author visibly stands for, but I'd put significant money on the answers to your questions being ""hell no"" and ""hell yes"", respectively.

This is what happens when you substitute a foreign language (and therefore culture) and pretend it's the native one. If your grandparents were ethnic Chinese born in Singapore, they almost certainly wrote in proper Chinese rather than PRC Simplified, and spoke Cantonese, Hokkien, or Teochew rather than Imperial Mandarin. When I read linguistics in uni, I read under a professor who started every single lecture (reportedly in his entire 40-plus-year career) with the declaration that

> A *language* is the *definition* of a specific *culture*, at a specific *place*, at a specific *time*. Change the culture, the place, or the time, and the language *must* change. *When* the language changes, that is *authoritative proof* that at least one of the others has, as well

(Emphasis in the original.) I've often wondered if Professor McKinley had ever spent time in Singapore; the longer I'm here (first came in '79), the more firmly I'm convinced he was calling us out with his usual discretion- and tact-enabled plausible deniability.

"Our mortality rate as you calculate it is inaccurate because the dorm cases only started shooting up around April 9. \~2000 of the cases in your denominator are too recent to have progressed to death.

But this undercounts those who are out of the danger zone but not yet testing negative.

"SINGAPORE -  A man found motionless at a staircase landing at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital on Thursday morning (April 23) later died from his injuries.Police said in a statement that they were alerted to a case of unnatural death at the hospital at around 7.30am.The man, an Indian national, 46, was found lying motionless at the staircase landing. He later died from his injuries.Based on preliminary investigations, the police said they do not suspect foul play. They are investigating the case.The Ministry of Health (MOH) confirmed that the man was a coronavirus patient.In a statement on Thursday evening, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said it is deeply saddened by the man's death. The man's family members and employer, as well as the Indian High Commission in Singapore, have been informed, said the MOM.The ministry said the man was a construction worker and had worked for the same employer since September 2009.""Background checks do not reveal any complaints against the employer,"" the ministry added.The man had lived in a factory-converted dormitory operated by the employer, which was last inspected on April 12.""At the time, it housed nine workers, including the deceased, less than the approved capacity for factory-converted dormitories. The dormitory was found to be in an acceptable condition, including cleanliness and ventilation,"" said the MOM.Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam and Manpower Minister Josephine Teo met the man's roommates at the dormitory.""The workers were sad but calm. They reported that they have been well taken care of by the employer,"" said MOM in its statement.The workers also requested that the man's nephew, who is also employed by the same company, be allowed to pay his last respects.The MOM said it is working with the MOH to facilitate the request.In a recorded video interview, Mrs Teo encouraged any workers who need help or have any feedback to approach the MOM.""We want to assure the workers once again that we are here to help them, and if there's anything at all, they can reach out to our officers. They have the numbers, and they know how to contact us,"" she said.""This is a difficult time for all of them. We appreciate all of their contributions to Singapore and we are committed to looking after them. So whatever it is that they need, as long as they reach out to us, we will provide the support to them.""Mrs Teo also said that ""we have assured (the workers) that they will be taken care of and we will help them to recover, and they should not hesitate to step forward to seek medical attention"".""Weve also assured them that we will work with their employers to ensure that they continue to be paid their salaries and that they can send money home to provide for their families,"" she said.On the death of the Indian worker, Mr Shanmugam said in Tamil in a recorded video interview that the police are investigating what happened, why it happened and whether the man had other medical issues.The ministry is also working with the Hindu Endowments Board to undertake the necessary funeral arrangements for the man, as well as the Migrant Workers' Centre to provide support to his family.-of-khoo-teck",2020-04-23 22:10:00,hardwarezone,singapore man found motionless staircase landing khoo teck puat hospital thursday morning april 23 later died injuries police said statement alerted case unnatural death hospital around 7 30am man indian national 46 found lying motionless staircase landing later died injuries based preliminary investigations police said not suspect foul play investigating case ministry health moh confirmed man patient statement thursday evening ministry manpower mom said deeply saddened man death man family members employer well indian high commission singapore informed said mom ministry said man construction worked employer since september 2009 background checks not reveal complaints against employer ministry added man lived factory converted operated employer last inspected april 12 time housed nine including deceased less approved capacity factory converted found acceptable condition including cleanliness ventilation said mom home affairs minister k shanmugam manpower minister josephine teo met man roommates sad calm reported well taken care employer said mom statement also requested man nephew also employed company allowed pay last respects mom said working moh facilitate request recorded video interview mrs teo encouraged need help feedback approach mom want assure help anything reach officers numbers know contact us said difficult time appreciate contributions singapore committed looking whatever need long reach us provide support mrs teo also said assured taken care help recover should not hesitate step forward seek medical attention also assured work employers ensure continue paid salaries send money home provide families said death indian mr shanmugam said tamil recorded video interview police investigating happened happened whether man medical issues ministry also working hindu endowments board undertake necessary funeral arrangements man well centre provide support family khoo teck

"I'm not sure if your view of it being filthy should be generalised. My experience is based on rooms that have always been occupied and dormitories that have existed for quite some time. In fact, I have even been to westlite dormitory at toh guan where it's currently a cluster. The whole bunk including kitchen, ""living room"" and bed room is slightly smaller than others that I have been to but ventilation is still not a problem. Again, I reiterate my same points: there are rooms which are dirty but there are also rooms that are clean in that dormitory. I strongly believe it is the role of the occupants in the room to maintain the cleanliness of the room.

Regarding the amenities, most dormitories are located in areas that are ulu and closer to industrial estates. This means that they lack leisure facilities which are usually located in neighbourhood estates. As a result, most dormitories cater these facilities for their occupants within the dormitory itself. For westlite at tohguan, you can check it out here "" -toh-guan/"".

Security guards may patrol the facility but I do not believe residents are checked. In order to enter the building itself, you must have a specialised card or something and it only allows entry if you are a resident so that may record their enter and exit timings but how does it affect occupants? Occupants of a room then have another physical key just for their room so there is no enter and exit timings for their room if that is what you are implying. 

The curfew and movement restrictions at night is intended to keep the noise level down in the facility and prevent gatherings in the middle of the night. In the dormitory itself not all workers work 8-5. There are workers who work different shifts and in the same room, meaning there may be workers working am shift while the other half work pm shift. With the curfew and movement restriction, i believe that is their true intention so that there is no unnecessary disturbance to other residents.

In actuality it's not a detention centre. It's a specific type of housing unit meant for temporary and not long term occupants. Yes their living accommodations are paid for by companies hiring them but it's not free. It seems free but it's deducted from the company's budget that is one of the reasons why their salary is lower as compared to a local.",2020-04-08 11:23:17,reddit,not sure view filthy should generalised experience based rooms always occupied existed quite time fact even westlite toh guan currently cluster whole bunk including kitchen living room bed room slightly smaller others ventilation still not problem reiterate points rooms dirty also rooms clean strongly believe role occupants room maintain cleanliness room regarding amenities located areas ulu closer industrial estates means lack leisure facilities usually located neighbourhood estates result cater facilities occupants within westlite tohguan check toh guan security guards may patrol facility not believe residents checked order enter building must specialised card something allows entry resident may record enter exit timings affect occupants occupants room another physical key room no enter exit timings room implying curfew movement restrictions night intended keep noise level facility prevent gatherings middle night not work 8 5 work different shifts room meaning may working shift half work pm shift curfew movement restriction believe true intention no unnecessary disturbance residents actuality not detention centre specific type housing unit meant temporary not long term occupants yes living accommodations paid companies hiring not free seems free deducted company budget one reasons salary lower compared local

"About BBT vs coffee-based chains like Starbucks & CBTL, one thing I've observed is their size difference in terms of actual shop area.

BBT shops tend to be tiny without much space to manoeuvre, and most do not have tables & chairs at all for dining in prior to the CB. If there's a queue, consumers plus delivery folks end up congregating in a group for the more popular outlets.

For those coffee outlets, with the lack of office workers nowadays I think their demand has went down. Even if they had more customers, there is likely space in their shops for them to do their waiting.

When I actually went to Toa Payoh Central once during the pre-tightened CB at 3pm (I'd assume this is not peak period), it was quite crazy looking at the stretch of 3 BBT shops in close proximity. Around 3-8 people in front of each shop, plus delivery folks waiting around. It became a congregation of about 30 people.

The Starbucks opposite the BBT shops on the other hand, was empty save for 1 customer.

Therefore I think this is why the coffee-based ones are allowed to continue operating and the BBT not.",2020-05-30 22:44:34,reddit,bbt vs coffee based chains like starbucks cbtl one thing observed size difference terms actual shop area bbt shops tend tiny without much space manoeuvre not tables chairs dining prior cb queue consumers plus delivery folks end congregating group popular outlets coffee outlets lack office nowadays think demand went even customers likely space shops waiting actually went toa payoh central pre tightened cb 3pm assume not peak period quite crazy looking stretch 3 bbt shops close proximity around 3 8 people front shop plus delivery folks waiting around became congregation 30 people starbucks opposite bbt shops hand empty save 1 customer therefore think coffee based ones allowed continue operating bbt not

However, that doesn't mean we should approve of it, and I understand where you are coming from. It looks to me that as always, the govt is ready to make ""economic sacrifices"" at the cost of smaller businesses, in exchange for a more ""safe"" end of lockdown.

"Why the PAP has failed14 Feb - there was a foreign worker tested positive for COVID-19 and he was rushed into ICU a day later. 17 Feb - 2 more foreign workers were tested positive for the virus. 18 Feb - it was revealed that they formed a new cluster from a work site.News came out and employers rushed to send their foreign workers, who are unwell, to the hospital for a swab test.19 Feb - MOM published a news article from Mr Kelvin Teoh (divisional director of MOM for foreign workers) that employers must not send the foreign workers to the hospital or they may have their WORK PASS privileges suspended. Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet.

"There is clue in the [30th April MOH daily report](-highlights/details/56-more-cases-discharged-528-new-cases-of-covid-19-infection-confirmed). 

> Work Permit holders (residing outside dormitories): 31  
>  
>There is an increase today in the number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside dormitories. **The vast majority of these cases are workers in the construction sector serving their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) requirements.**  

There are construction workers who live outside dorms. Note that non-Malaysian construction workers are not allowed to rent HDBs. But construction workers can be housed in temporary quarters near/in construction sites, and in private housing (typically run-down units above shophouses). Some may also be housed illegally in warehouses and commercial buildings that aren't official factory-converted dorms. I personally think that MOH is being kind of evasive about this because some of the non-dorm WP cases were being housed illegally and they don't want to air even more dirty laundry.

Some pre-COVID examples of illegally housed, overcrowded WP holders:

"Wife of grassroots leader in workers’ dorm business, shows their Sentosa weekend “party home” to mediaIt was earlier reported that as of Wed (8 Apr) this week, active COVID-19 clusters have been found at 9 different foreign worker dormitories in Singapore.A few of the 9 are operated by companies linked to grassroots leaders of People’s Association (PA). The top 2 foreign worker dormitories with the most number of confirmed COVID-19 cases as of yesterday (10 Apr) were S11 Dormitory (306 cases) and Westlite Toh Guan (69 cases). Both have been gazetted by the government as isolation areas under the Infectious Diseases Act.In particular, Westlite Toh Guan is run by public listed company Centurion Corporation Ltd, helmed by two PA grassroots leaders who are “joint chairmen” of the company: David Loh Kim Kang and Han Seng Juan. Han was awarded PBM in 2010 and BBM in 2015, while Loh got his PBM in 2011 and BBM in 2016.They were both given public service medals for “helping” out at Potong Pasir SMC under MP Sitoh Yih Pin. In the general election of 2011, PAP managed to wrestle back Potong Pasir from opposition and it’s now under PAP.Another board member of Centurion Corporation, Rajah & Tann’s lawyer Chandra Mohan, is also a grassroots leader awarded with PBM and BBM in recognition of his contribution towards community services in Northwest Community Development Council (NWCDC).Han’s Sentosa Cove weekend party home has rooms inspired by four seasonsFurther checks online revealed that socialite Susanna Kang is married to Han. In fact, 4 years ago, Mrs Han opened up their weekend “party home” at Sentosa Cove for reporters to take a look (‘Chic abodes: Two stylish women open up their homes‘).Mrs Han is said to be a “fixture in society magazines”, often seen wearing head-turning gowns and ensembles, complete with elaborate hairstyles.At the Hans’ Sentosa Cove weekend home, the ST reporter noted the “creative streak” in its design. “Standing on a 9,000 sq ft plot of land, the expansive house is a weekend home and features rooms inspired by the four seasons,” the reporter wrote. “It is here that the family entertain friends and host dinners for close business partners about once a month, with as many as 100 people gathering at what has come to be known as the Party House.”Apparently, Mrs Han wanted a house that has the “wow factor” for the purpose of entertaining guests. It was built in 2012. A “curtain” weighing more than 2,721kg imported from Germany and made of high-grade stainless steel cloaks the perimeter of the second floor. It can be pulled back to get an unblocked beautiful view of the sea.When guests arrive at the four-storey house, they descend a long flight of stairs into a cavernous basement. Mrs Han said, “I meant for it to be like a runway, where guests can sashay and strut their stuff down the stairs. It’s also the perfect spot to see the rest of the house. As you look up from the stairs, you get a good look at what else there is to explore.”The basement is filled with futuristic-looking furniture from well-known brands and designers such as Italian label Moroso and renowned architect Zaha Hadid. An Hermes screen, made of a wood frame and scraps of crocodile skin taken from the cutting-room floor at the French luxury house’s atelier, adds a luxurious touch. A luscious green wall, filled with creepers growing under ultraviolet light, is encased behind a misty glass screen, creating a tropical spring feel for the basement. Adding to that wild factor are two taxidermied peacocks that preen regally next to the bar.The dining room has a 22-seat custom-made table with bronzed legs and a high-gloss finish – the result of multiple layers of lacquer. It beautifully reflects American industrial designer Karim Rashid’s topograph-shaped chandelier that was made as part of Swarovski’s Crystal Palace collection.The upper floors were designed for smaller break-out groups for relaxation especially after a nice dinner. On second level there are 3 rooms: One is a karaoke and media room, complete with decor of KTV lounges for the “feel of the real thing”, said Mrs Han. Another has a masculine vibe with a dark brown sofa by Italian furniture-maker Poltrona Frau and a well-stocked wine chiller. Here, the men can kick back and relax with cigars, while talking business, politics or any other matters. The third room simulates a chic ski resort cabin. Mrs Han has the air-conditioning ducts trained on this area so that the blast of cold air creates that icy feeling. The floor is covered in a fluffy, white carpet and there is a fireplace that runs on ethanol. It produces flames, but not heat.For parties around the pool, guests head to the summer room in the attic that is designed to look like a ship’s cabin. Sofa beds face the infinity pool outside. For movie nights, a hidden projector comes down and guests can kick back or sleep over if they want to and wake up to a sea view. “I get my respite here. It’s quite peaceful looking at the blue, open sea,” she said.She described her Sentosa home as a “modern kelong” as it is surrounded by water but the family does not live there. Their family home is a good-class bungalow in Bukit Timah.(Pictures of the Hans’ Sentosa Cove weekend home from ST Photo):Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) warns about crammed condition in foreign worker dormitoriesMeanwhile, non-profit organization Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) has been warning about the crammed conditions in foreign worker dormitories being highly conducive to spread the coronavirus (‘Forum: Employers’ practices leave foreign workers vulnerable to infection‘, 23 Mar).Writing to ST Forum on 23 Mar, TWC2 said, “Currently, foreign workers are housed 12 to 20 men per room in double-decker beds. They are transported to work on the back of lorries sitting shoulder to shoulder. Neither of these conditions conforms with social distancing. The risk of a new cluster among this group remains undeniable,”TWC2 warned and advocated that new dormitory should require more space per head and no more than four persons to a room.On TWC2 website, it shows a picture of how crammed the condition is at a dormitory (Westlite Mandai) run by Han’s company.Indeed, about a week later after TWC2 wrote to ST to warn everyone, clusters of COVID-19 started breaking out in different foreign worker dormitories.Perhaps Han should ask his wife to use her “creative streak” to also help design the Centurion’s foreign worker dormitories so that the workers can have less crammed spaces to live in?

"1. As of 23 April 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 1,037 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:      a) Imported cases: 0      There are no imported cases today.      b) Cases in the community: 25 (22 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents1, 3 Work Passes)The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 34 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 25 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has decreased slightly, from an average of 20 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 18 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.      c) Work Permit holders (residing outside dormitories): 30The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside dormitories has continued to increase, from an average of 16 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 30 per day in the past week.       d) Work Permit holders (residing in dormitories): 982The main increase today continues to be for Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, where we are picking up many more cases because of extensive testing. Most of these cases have a mild illness and are being monitored in the community isolation facilities or general ward of our hospitals. None of them is in the intensive care unit.2. Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.3. Of the new cases, 75% are linked to known clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.Links between previous cases found4. In the past week (16 April to 22 April), MOH has uncovered links for 1,024 previously unlinked cases.5. Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer to Annex B for details.Update on condition of confirmed cases6. 36 more cases2 of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 924 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.7. As our care protocols adapt based on our understanding of the disease, we have re-categorised the confirmed cases to more accurately reflect where the confirmed cases are being cared for. There are currently 1,368 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 26 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. 8,874 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 12 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.8. Case 8190, a 46 year-old male Indian national, has passed away on 23 April. He was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection on 19 April, and had been warded at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.

"Probably because foreign workers cannot vote and whatever impacts them doesn’t really resonate with what concerns the electorate (e.g. employment, housing, CPF, MRT etc)

I think the main party mentioning this is SDP, with CSJ regularly highlighting prior to the election about the  whole mask debacle and not locking down earlier. However, the angle he is taking is that these actions shows that the PAP is “inhumane” etc and doesn’t care about the health of citizens and are just greedy. (Up to you to decide whether that is a fair judgement)

Side note, opposition parties did use FW to attack the PAP in previous elections. In GE 2011, LTK brought up the issue of the government constructing a foreign worker dormitory near Serangoon Gardens, and how they did not listen to the concerns of residents and just went ahead to build it. Given that he won, that angle seems to resonate more with the electorate than the welfare of foreign workers.

That said, I can guarantee that there will be reforms with the FW dorms post elections. The government will have no choice but to issue new standards for dormitories and enforce them highly, given how the lax standards greatly affected the economy.",2020-06-30 22:49:19,reddit,probably cannot vote whatever impacts doesn really resonate concerns electorate e g employment housing cpf mrt etc think main party mentioning sdp csj regularly highlighting prior election whole mask debacle not locking earlier however angle taking actions shows pap inhumane etc doesn care health citizens greedy decide whether fair judgement side note opposition parties use attack pap previous elections ge 2011 ltk brought issue government constructing near serangoon gardens not listen concerns residents went ahead build given won angle seems resonate electorate welfare said guarantee reforms post elections government no choice issue new standards enforce highly given lax standards greatly affected economy

"**TLDR: I disagree with most aspects of the arguments from the Critical Spectator poster (henceforth ""CS guy"") but I believe that this reasoning doesn't make him a racist.**

The word ""racist"" has been too frequently used as an end-all counterargument that it has lost its powerful original meaning. A racist is someone who deems his ethnicity to be superior to other ethnicities and acts based on this belief. A racist is an asshole by default, but the reverse is not necessarily true: you can be an inconsiderate, unsympathetic and uncompassionate idiot (like the CS guy) and **not** be a racist.

Reading the CS guy's post, I see that he opposes new dorm construction on economic and social grounds. These arguments are ridiculous. On the economic reason - I don't see any statistically significant reduction in housing prices in areas with dense foreign worker population (Little India, Jalan Besar, Bencoolen). In fact, these are lively areas whose ethnic diversity serves as a magnet to local/international tourists and a driver of economic activities (restaurants, shops, etc). In addition, the CS guy peppered his post with various unfounded, sometimes asinine assumptions: that people anywhere hate living next to ""social housing"", that migrant men want to ""hook up with maid girlfriends"", that the dorms would take up spaces that otherwise would be used to make parks and pools, etc. These are all broad, untenable assumptions that show how little he knows about how these migrants work and behave.

But - and this is a big but - those arguments don't make him a racist. By simply calling him a racist without taking on his arguments directly you won't change his opinion; rather, he will simply see you as a virtue-signalling SJW and the discussion will ground to a halt. If we want to have a conversation with somebody like the CS guy and influence the public discourse, let's avoid loaded terms like ""racist"", ""xenophobic"", etc unless they are really called for.",2020-06-06 19:58:34,reddit,tldr disagree aspects arguments critical spectator poster henceforth cs guy believe reasoning doesn make racist word racist frequently used end counterargument lost powerful original meaning racist someone deems ethnicity superior ethnicities acts based belief racist asshole default reverse not necessarily true inconsiderate unsympathetic uncompassionate idiot like cs guy not racist reading cs guy post see opposes new construction economic social grounds arguments ridiculous economic reason see statistically significant reduction housing prices areas dense population little india jalan besar bencoolen fact lively areas whose ethnic diversity serves magnet local international tourists driver economic activities restaurants shops etc addition cs guy peppered post various unfounded sometimes asinine assumptions people anywhere hate living next social housing men want hook maid girlfriends would take spaces otherwise would used make parks pools etc broad untenable assumptions show little knows migrants work behave big arguments make racist simply calling racist without taking arguments directly won change opinion rather simply see virtue signalling sjw discussion ground halt want conversation somebody like cs guy influence public discourse let avoid loaded terms like racist xenophobic etc unless really called

Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet.

But when you have a much larger dorm, the requirements are quite different, the scale is very different. We need to weave this into the design of the dormitories themselves.

> Instead of just lowering the threshold, the more practical approach we believe is to add on additional requirements for dormitories above 1,000 beds.

They continue to cover a wide range of the concerns that we have today, and they will be looked at and will continue to be strengthened over time.

"Yes definitely! It’s worrying that we are the largest cluster, and the recent heavy rain + many construction sites (due to HDB development) and not forgetting the foliage surrounding the old cemetery area are a big contributing factor. Lots of seniors on this side too, so there needs to be some infrastructure in place to curb the spread. 

Also noticed that the Joo Seng / Woodleigh area hasn’t been on the radar until recent years due to the new HDB estate developments, and given the near nature-reserve status of the Bidadari area as well, another point of contention would also be plans to conservation of nature while having plans for to improve the area in general which has ruffled the feathers of nature enthusiasts. More accessible facilities would be great, too, esp. since the CC is a good 20 mins walk away from me and it’s harder for us on this side to enjoy and access :(

"We don't necessary have to follow through. ***""Not all help are beneficial, though it ultimately benefit whoever is still around to benefit from it.""*** We never know if this indirectly results in an industry going under, or the start of a next property bubble in an economy downturn. Alternatively, this also push forward more automated constructions methods which ends up causing job losses for FW.

There's many types of propaganda games, and this likely is just one that goes this way **""Don't be so hard on us (the government), you have to share the blame too, we did it for your benefit after all""**. Have to take the heat off and remind people that they are not incompetent. Singaporeans were the one who signed petitions and did not want FW around HDB areas after all, thus dorms had to be build where we can't see them, while we turn a blind eye and happily praise the government for a wise decision.

The funny part is that, eventually after reducing the amount of available FW thru automation, we will begin to brag about how we take care of FW, providing them with upskilling opportunities and better work safety. And Singaporeans will cheers on like fools while ignoring that perhaps 60% of the labor has been fired and sent back home hmm... but well, will Singaporeans care?

***Edit:*** I will highlight that I'm not against better treatment for FW. I'm just saying that we might not exactly be helping them, by trying to ""help"" them.

"It probably won't go up by that much anyway, so much  of the cost is in the land, materials, and all the fat cats who make a couple percent here and there. There's also the economic advantage of all the money staying in Singapore, 3k/month per Singaporean is probably about the same cost.

I think the problem is at this point we don't have the culture nor skills. Also NS taking up so much time is a problem, in Canada construction work seemed to be the NS for some people. Young people would do it for a few years for the money.

"What has this got to do with what's in the article? The article is talking about habits when it comes to personal hygiene. Per your example, if that same pool of blood appeared outside your door in the common corridor, I'm sure most people will take steps to clean. It's precisely cos it's a public place that people don't take initiative to clean it. There's a distribution of responsibility, almost like the bystander effect. But what the article is talking about is personal hygiene in your own living space. I don't fully agree with the sentiments raised in the article but I definitely agree that the MW have to take some responsibility in how things turned out. For comparison, look to our foreign students. A lot of them live in dorms too. Yet we don't see their living spaces become so dirty and unkempt. If they know to (or perhaps are forced to by the school admin) keep their dorms clean, I'm sure the MW can do the very basic too.

"That's around the date when the number of positive cases that were Indian nationals starting shooting up, and more and more were formally linked to dorms/construction sites.

So after that I decided to save time by categorizing all adult male Indian nationals from then on to be dorm/construction-related. In March and earlier, there was still a decent chance that any Indian national could be an expat in some other industry. In April, sure, there could be a handful of Indian nationals that I mis-categorized, but there are vastly outnumbered by the dorm/construction workers.

"Foreign workers’ cramp living conditions very ideal for spread of COVID-19; So why no preparation for an outbreak?Activists such as Jolovan Wham have long criticised Singapore for the way it treats its foreign workers. It would probably be fair to say that they live in tight cramp quarters with low pay and no rights to citizenship even as they build the infrastructure in which we rely on.Even Professor Tommy Koh, Singapore’s Ambassador-at-Large commented that foreign workers are treated in a Third World manner.“…The government has allowed their employers to transport them in flat bed trucks with no seats. They stay in overcrowded dormitories and are packed likes sardines with 12 persons to a room. The dormitories are not clean or sanitary. The dormitories were like a time bomb waiting to explode. They have now exploded with many infected workers. Singapore should treat this as a wake up call to treat our indispensable foreign workers like a First World country should and not in the disgraceful way in which they are treated now..Given their housing arrangements, it comes as no surprise that the dreaded COVID-19 has reared its ugly head in these foreign worker dormitories.As of yesterday, 6 of the reported COVID-19 clusters are foreign workers dormitories and three that are construction sites.Bloomberg reports that:“Singapore reported its highest daily increase of coronavirus cases on Sunday, as infections rose among foreign workers housed in massive dormitories…….In particular, two previously reported clusters, involving dorms for foreign workers, saw a jump in the number of cases. These two dorms have now been declared “isolation areas” and any individuals residing there will have to stay in their rooms for 14 days to avoid the spread of the virus, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo. Almost 20,000 people live in the two dorms.”Countries the world over have asked its citizens to go into lock down in their own home to reduce the spread of the virus.But how are foreign workers who live so closely together in their dormitories ever to go into lock down or isolation properly? Even if they were to isolate themselves from the public, they still have to share their room with 10-20 other room mates.With people living so closely together, its conditions are pretty much ideal for the spread of the virus!Should Singapore not have done something earlier about this? It is after all not rocket science that the dormitories would be sitting ducks for the corona virus spread?Besides, cases having foreign workers being infected with COVID-19 are not new. There have been reports of the virus spreading in foreign workers’ accommodation as early as 10 February this year.Almost two whole months ago!Why didn’t the government act then? Why has the government not thought of measures to spread the foriegn workers out or find alternative housing in an event of a outbreak within a dormitory?Now, the workers in the two largest cluster of COVID-19 infection — S11 Dormitory @ Punggol (63 cases) and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory (28 cases) — are being isolated within the dormitories itself.This reeks of a potential repeat of the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship where the Japanese government is being accused of failing to isolate the crew of the Diamond Princess from the beginning of the quarantine, he said infected workers may have passed on “secondary or tertiary” infections to their fellow crew members and passengers, thereby exacerbating the deadly outbreak. At least 705 people contracted the virus during the quarantine, four of whom have died.Now word has it that the government is scrambling to refurnish housings to house these foreign workers for quarantine. But the government has had ample time to react but has seemingly done little or nothing? Why?Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo has said that the “key objective is to ensure the health and well-being of everyone, not just of our own people but also foreign workers helping our economy… We want to give foreign workers the assurance that the measures we take are in their interest as well as their well-being.”While the statement sends a strong feeling of intent, questions still remain as to whether this is a case of too little too late? If we genuinely cared about the welfare of our foreign workers, why wait till now to take action?We already know they live in close quarters. We already know that the virus tends to spread through close contact. Surely, it is a question of common sense to have done something about this earlier?Now that the virus has already begun to spread in the living quarters of the workers, it may well be too late to effectively stem the tide.Singapore prides itself as an efficient country. In view of this reputation of efficiency, it might be harder to believe that the government did not have an inkling that foreign workers would be susceptible to the outbreak and make preparation for it.",2020-06-04 11:47:00,hardwarezone,cramp living conditions ideal spread no preparation outbreak activists jolovan wham long criticised singapore way treats would probably fair say live tight cramp quarters low pay no rights citizenship even build infrastructure rely even professor tommy koh singapore ambassador large commented treated third world manner government allowed employers transport flat bed trucks no seats stay overcrowded packed likes sardines 12 persons room not clean sanitary like time bomb waiting explode exploded many infected singapore should treat wake call treat indispensable like first world country should not disgraceful way treated given housing arrangements comes no surprise dreaded reared ugly head yesterday 6 reported clusters three construction sites bloomberg reports singapore reported highest daily increase sunday infections rose among housed massive particular two previously reported clusters involving saw jump number two declared isolation areas individuals residing stay rooms 14 days avoid spread said manpower minister josephine teo almost 20 000 people live two countries world asked citizens go lock home reduce spread live closely together ever go lock isolation properly even isolate public still share room 10 20 room mates people living closely together conditions pretty much ideal spread should singapore not done something earlier not rocket science would sitting ducks corona spread besides infected not new reports spreading accommodation early 10 february year almost two whole months ago didn government act government not thought measures spread foriegn find alternative housing event outbreak within two largest cluster infection s11 punggol 63 westlite toh guan 28 isolated within reeks potential repeat diamond princess cruise ship japanese government accused failing isolate crew diamond princess beginning quarantine said infected may passed secondary tertiary infections fellow crew members passengers thereby exacerbating deadly outbreak least 705 people contracted quarantine four died word government scrambling refurnish housings house quarantine government ample time react seemingly done little nothing minister manpower josephine teo said key objective ensure health well everyone not people also helping economy want give assurance measures take interest well well statement sends strong feeling intent questions still remain whether case little late genuinely cared welfare wait till take action already know live close quarters already know tends spread close contact surely question common sense done something earlier already begun spread living quarters may well late effectively stem tide singapore prides efficient country view reputation efficiency might harder believe government not inkling would susceptible outbreak make preparation

I have the same sentiments as you that we can improve their living conditions but I am against the fact that you are exaggerating their living conditions to seem like they live in horrible conditions which will misguide the public or those who are unaware. 

With regard to your second point, my opinion is that the current implementations are a necessary evil. The police are mainly there to enforce and make sure everyone stays put in the facility. With the sudden cluster outbreak and with covid at times having no symptoms, it's wise to contain the area and further prevent the spread. At least now we are able to identify suspects of covid, keeping them in place and dealing with them efficiently. It is a necessary evil because its the easiest way to contain the spread of the virus and prevent unlinked cases from increasing. 

With regard to not practicing social distancing, the workers are already in a facility where covid is apparent. The role of social distancing is to prevent further spread of the virus. In a way, the current measure is working because we are preventing the spread of covid to the outside world by containing the area. This move is similar to issuing a shn just that it's in a larger scale, affecting more people and enforced. With regards to multiple people being in the same room, the rooms are not as small as you think. The easiest way to describe would be that the size and layout of the room is similar to the bunks in tekong although they are smaller by a bit. Despite this there is also only a limited space in the dormitory, it's not feasible to move people around to maintain a super safe social distance. There's just no choice because in order to put social distancing in rooms into practice, the facility would have to move people out of rooms. Then the next issue would be where to move people without rooms? In my opinion the best solution now would be to have the facility management and the authorities to go through with workers why the place is under lock down and explain to them why the current measure is necessary. They should also gather all workers to address any concerns workers will have. This may quell any anger or resentment that occupants will have towards people in authority.",2020-04-08 11:54:10,reddit,sentiments improve living conditions against fact exaggerating living conditions seem like live horrible conditions misguide public unaware regard second point opinion current implementations necessary evil police mainly enforce make sure everyone stays put facility sudden cluster outbreak times no symptoms wise contain area prevent spread least able identify suspects keeping place dealing efficiently necessary evil easiest way contain spread prevent unlinked increasing regard not practicing social distancing already facility apparent role social distancing prevent spread way current measure working preventing spread outside world containing area move similar issuing shn larger scale affecting people enforced regards multiple people room rooms not small think easiest way describe would size layout room similar bunks tekong although smaller bit despite also limited space not feasible move people around maintain super safe social distance no choice order put social distancing rooms practice facility would move people rooms next issue would move people without rooms opinion best solution would facility management authorities go place lock explain current measure necessary should also gather address concerns may quell anger resentment occupants towards people authority

"Ex-Deputy Prime Ministers Tharman and Teo Chee Hean brought in to handle manpower matters -deputy-prime...r-matters/After Senior Ministers Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Teo Chee Hean were roped in to handle manpower matters like the jobs council and the foreign worker dormitories situation, some Singaporeans are speculating whether Manpower Minister Josephine Teo was given too big a portfolio for her to cope with.Mr Tharman and Mr Teo served as Singapore’s Deputy Prime Ministers from 2011 to 2019. The pair stepped down from their posts and became Senior Ministers on 1 May 2019, following a Cabinet reshuffle that was designed to give fourth-generation (4G) ministers more exposure and responsibilities so that they can better support the next Prime Minister who will come from their cohort.The Cabinet reshuffle saw the ruling People’s Action Party’s (PAP) 4G cohort accept several promotions that resulted in them leading two-thirds of the Government’s ministries. Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat kept his ministry but also succeeded Mr Tharman and Mr Teo as Singapore’s sole Deputy Prime Minister, giving rise to speculation that he is the ruling party’s Prime Minister designate.Besides Mr Tharman and Mr Teo, fellow veteran politician Lim Swee Say stepped down from his post as Manpower Minister and was succeeded by Josephine Teo, who became Singapore’s second female minister to helm a ministry after Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu.While Mr Tharman and Mr Teo seemed to take a backseat to allow the younger ministers to take charge, they have now taken on important responsibilities that pertain to manpower.Current DPM Heng Swee Keat tapped on Mr Tharman to chair the new National Jobs Council. Asserting that his predecessor has “both detailed knowledge and deep expertise in this issue” in his latest supplementary budget speech last month, Mr Heng revealed that the National Jobs Council will focus on creating jobs and helping workers build deep skills to stay employable in the challenging economy.Mr Teo was brought in to handle the foreign worker dormitories issue after COVID-19 outbreaks in the dorms ended up infecting over 33,567 workers and counting. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that Mr Teo is playing an advisory role in the Government’s inter agency task force to handle the situation in the dorms.The veteran politicians’ involvement in what are perceived as manpower matters has raised questions about the capabilities of Manpower Minister Josephine Teo.Mrs Teo was just recently under public scrutiny for the way she handled the COVID-19 outbreaks at the foreign worker dormitories. Some Singaporeans blamed the minister for allowing the COVID-19 situation to spiral out of control among migrant workers even though she was warned in advance that this might happen due to the workers’ overcrowded living conditions.When she was asked why she did not act early in implementing safe distancing measures in the dorms before the coronavirus infection spread uncontrolled, Mrs Teo did not apologise and instead blamed a lack of hindsight.Expressing a wish to “rewind the clock” to implement safe distancing measures in the dorms earlier, she told the local press: “If possible, I really wish to know at which stage the infection has already spread to community and migrant workers group? If time can be rewound, this is what I wish I could know.”2 LANCHIOWS 1 CB TO HANDLE SIMPLE TASK",2020-07-06 17:50:00,sgtalk,ex deputy prime ministers tharman teo chee hean brought handle manpower matters deputy prime r matters senior ministers tharman shanmugaratnam teo chee hean roped handle manpower matters like jobs council situation singaporeans speculating whether manpower minister josephine teo given big portfolio cope mr tharman mr teo served singapore deputy prime ministers 2011 2019 pair stepped posts became senior ministers 1 may 2019 following cabinet reshuffle designed give fourth generation 4g ministers exposure responsibilities better support next prime minister come cohort cabinet reshuffle saw ruling people action party pap 4g cohort accept several promotions resulted leading two thirds government ministries finance minister heng swee keat kept ministry also succeeded mr tharman mr teo singapore sole deputy prime minister giving rise speculation ruling party prime minister designate besides mr tharman mr teo fellow veteran politician lim swee say stepped post manpower minister succeeded josephine teo became singapore second female minister helm ministry minister culture community youth grace fu mr tharman mr teo seemed take backseat allow younger ministers take charge taken important responsibilities pertain manpower current dpm heng swee keat tapped mr tharman chair new national jobs council asserting predecessor detailed knowledge deep expertise issue latest supplementary budget speech last month mr heng revealed national jobs council focus creating jobs helping build deep skills stay employable challenging economy mr teo brought handle issue outbreaks ended infecting 33 567 counting prime minister lee hsien loong said mr teo playing advisory role government inter agency task force handle situation veteran politicians involvement perceived manpower matters raised questions capabilities manpower minister josephine teo mrs teo recently public scrutiny way handled outbreaks singaporeans blamed minister allowing situation spiral control among even though warned advance might happen due overcrowded living conditions asked not act early implementing safe distancing measures infection spread uncontrolled mrs teo not apologise instead blamed lack hindsight expressing wish rewind clock implement safe distancing measures earlier told local press possible really wish know stage infection already spread community group time rewound wish could know 2 lanchiows 1 cb handle simple task

"-teoSINGAPORE - About 20 purpose-built dormitories for foreign workers breach dormitory licence conditions each year, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo.This amounts to nearly half of the 43 such dormitories regulated under the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act (Feda), which together house some 200,000 workers.An average of 1,200 employers a year have also been punished for providing unacceptable accommodation for their workers, said Mrs Teo, responding to questions from MPs, including Workers' Party MP Png Eng Huat (Hougang), who asked about the virus outbreak among foreign workers.If 50% of licensees breach the licensing conditions in any licensing regime, this should have thrown up a BIG RED FLAG. And MOM didn't do anything until now?The minister said that when lapses are found, these must be rectified immediately. Dorm operators can be fined up to $50,000, jailed for up to a year, or both for such offences.I hope the government will take serious action against the dorm operators.",2020-05-05 15:33:00,sgtalk,teosingapore 20 purpose built breach licence conditions year said manpower minister josephine teo amounts nearly half 43 regulated employee act feda together house 200 000 average 1 200 employers year also punished providing unacceptable accommodation said mrs teo responding questions mps including party mp png eng huat hougang asked outbreak among 50 licensees breach licensing conditions licensing regime should thrown big red flag mom didn anything minister said lapses found must rectified immediately operators fined 50 000 jailed year offences hope government take serious action against operators

2. It's also important to consider that most operators operates other form of accommodations (Eg. Student) and in different geographical location (Eg. Malaysia, UK, etc) How much of the profits is related to their operations in dorms?

"There are more than 40,000 Malaysians still in Singapore and the Malaysian state of Johor hopes that Singapore will make exemptions for them to be tested for Covid-19 before they are allowed to return to the state.More Malaysian workers are making their way back from Singapore after the Republic began implementing stricter measures to address the pandemic under a period known as the ""circuit breaker"". The measures which began on April 7 and will go on until May 4 have seen most workplaces and schools closed in order to reduce the risk of infections.Currently, Malaysians who test negative in Singapore will be able to go home and be quarantined there, while those without any certification or prior testing will be required to undergo compulsory 14-day quarantine at one of the government centres statewide.Johor Mentri Besar Hasni Mohammad said the state was working with the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the matter with their counterpart in Singapore given that the city-state presently does not conduct Covid-19 tests unless a person has showed symptoms.Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia Vanu Gopala Menon previously said there was currently no requirement by the Singapore government to provide random Covid-19 tests for foreign workers while Singapore's Ministry of Health has said that Covid-19 testing is only performed when clinically indicated, for patients and their close contacts.""That means a Malaysian can't get the test done in Singapore unless they are symptomatic, "" Datuk Hasni said in an interview in the Johor district of Iskandar Puteri.""We hope Singapore will allow for some exemptions so that Malaysians who want to return can get this test done at its clinics or hospitals, "" he said.Hasni said he was confident that the matter would be discussed through the Malaysia-Singapore Special Working Committee on Covid-19 for a solution to be reached.He said since Malaysia implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) on March 18 to curb the coronavirus, it has resolved certain issues, including easing the movement of cargo, essential and non-essential items between both countries as well as accommodation for Malaysian workers in Singapore.""The government will not stop Malaysians returning from Singapore and I can assure them that our frontliners have taken all the necessary steps and procedures at our border, "" he said.Hasni urged returning Malaysians to give their full cooperation to the frontliners conducting the necessary screening and testing at the checkpoints.On the number of Malaysians returning from Singapore after the island republic started its own measures to curb the spread of the virus, Hasni said the biggest influx was registered on April 3 with some 3,400 people.

"I agree with you in the sense that statistically speaking, discrimination based on ethnicity makes ""logical"" sense. With the black community in the US as an example, they have statistically higher crime rates and poorer academic scores. However, this is due to significant amounts of discrimination, systematic and otherwise, that their communities have faced for a long time. What you would want to do, as a society, is give a chance to those who overcome the stereotype - in other words, the black guy who, despite his poor upbringing, seems like a genuinely good person. Why use cultural stereotypes to judge someone instead of judging him or her based on their actions, their words, and their character?

I also agree that there's this unfortunate tendency to label someone as racist and leave it at that. I think this results in unnecessary polarisation and doesn't explore the bases of their beliefs and prejudices - hence not actually reducing racism, but driving it underground. This is probably a more significant problem in Singapore than it is in other countries because we actually have laws, vaguely written, which punish people who commit hate speech.",2020-06-07 08:27:15,reddit,agree sense statistically speaking discrimination based ethnicity makes logical sense black community us example statistically higher crime rates poorer academic scores however due significant amounts discrimination systematic otherwise communities faced long time would want society give chance overcome stereotype words black guy despite poor upbringing seems like genuinely good person use cultural stereotypes judge someone instead judging based actions words character also agree unfortunate tendency label someone racist leave think results unnecessary polarisation doesn explore bases beliefs prejudices hence not actually reducing racism driving underground probably significant problem singapore countries actually laws vaguely written punish people commit hate speech

"I made this graph for those who have been trying to grapple with estimating the risk to the general public vs foreign worker dorms and construction sites.

Please note that lately, when MOH announces cases at night, the count includes cases confirmed that day as well as ""overflow"" from the day before. Therefore, the numbers in this chart don't tally with the announced numbers, and the data for 10-Apr are incomplete as more cases will be added on today.

The testing/reporting system may be under strain as of the cases announced last night, only 50+ were from yesterday and the rest were from the day before.

**Cases that aren't related to foreign worker dorms and constructions sites seem to be on a downward trend since 7/4/20**; hope it stays that way. It was only 51 cases and I included some China/Myanmar/Thai cases that could turn out to be dorm/construction-related but aren't formally linked yet.

I did this using the data at []() and ordering by local transmission and nationality. Classifying whether a case is likely linked to a foreign worker dorm or construction site is inexact. Basically all Bangladeshi adult males are assumed to be dorm-related; I also classified all Indian (nationality) males confirmed after Mar-31 to be dorm-related. China/Myanmar/Thai nationals were only classified as dorm-related if they were officially linked.

"> # Coronavirus: Conditions in dorms not main reason for clusters, says Tan Chuan-Jin

> The massive outbreak of coronavirus cases among migrant workers in dormitories cannot be attributed to bad living conditions alone, even if there are abysmal examples, said Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin yesterday.

> Rather, the highly contagious nature of the coronavirus and the fact that dorms involve groups of people living in close quarters are more likely to have contributed to the spread, said Mr Tan, who was Manpower Minister from 2014 to 2015.

> Speaking on the sidelines of an event for migrant worker dorms yesterday, Mr Tan said it was important not to conflate the two issues of bad living conditions and the Covid-19 pandemic, which he called a healthcare crisis of ""monumental proportions"".

> ""For example, in our universities, if the hostels remained open and the students were there, you would expect a massive outbreak to occur as well. If people are living in close quarters, given the contagious nature of this virus, outbreaks will occur,"" he said.

> Tackling questions regarding the outbreak in the dormitories, that as of yesterday has hit more than 18,000 cases, Mr Tan said it was not about ""white-washing"" cases of ""abysmal"" dorm conditions, but one should not generalise that all living conditions are as such.

> There were 741 new Covid-19 cases reported yesterday, bringing Singapore's total to 20,939.

> The living conditions of lower-paid foreign workers have been in the spotlight recently when dorms emerged as huge clusters where the coronavirus has spread. The outbreak highlighted the cramped and poorly maintained living spaces of some of these workers and their low-quality catered meals.

> On Monday, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo assured Parliament that the Government will see how housing standards for migrant workers can be further raised.

> Mr Tan said: ""It doesn't excuse (bad conditions), it is not acceptable and we need to take stringent action against those who violate the law - but it doesn't represent the whole space and that's the context that is important.

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> ""It is important to speak to the migrant workers as a whole for their lived experience to have a sense of the conditions. And given the scale and nature of this outbreak, we should not conflate the causes with these less-than-accurate generalisations.""

> When asked about the raising of dorm standards here, Mr Tan said there are things that can be improved on and the Government will be taking stock of the lessons learnt and the adjustments that need to be made.

> ""It is something that we will work on, but meanwhile, let's grapple with the (present) issues, look after our people and look after all the people who are here in Singapore who are affected in different ways,"" he said.

> During an online forum organised by the Institute of Policy Studies on Wednesday, analysts said a whole-of-society effort is needed to improve the wages and living conditions of foreign workers here.

> Not only must the Government take the lead in making structural changes, but Singaporeans, too, must change their us-versus-them mindset and take up collective responsibility, said the panellists.

"Didn't need proof, lol. It was inevitable. 

Society is a hot mess of discombobulating, incoherent and inconsistent ideas. And the bottom line is everyone has a voice, everyone is able to influence the outcome. It's simultaneously empowering and discouraging. 

Back in 2011, the influx of foreign labour was the, if not one of the largest, election issue. It cost the PAP a talented Foreign Minister (oh - and a GRC. Whatever). Since 2011 you can track a very clear and blunt shift in policy, focused on keeping FWs away from the public eye. The Little India Riots didn't help, and the public furor only cemented the policy turn as being the right thing to do (if only to avoid public outrage). 

Now, one can persist in laying that at the feet of the PAP, saying that's the PAP abdicating moral responsibility, etc. But another can also make the argument that the PAP was simply following their democratic mandate and listening to the people. *I find it very hard to accept any denial that the voters back in 2011 had a hand in creating the standard of living that FWs experience now*.  

Consequently, while I applauded the outpouring of goodwill to the FWs in the Covid saga, the inevitable pushback was inevitable. Because society is a hot mess. 

My response above was to the comment that we can simply ignore these people, that their views are inconsequential because they're ""wrong"". No. We can't. That's not how democracy works. They will have their voice. There will be an opposition party who will, under the temptation of quick and easy votes, champion their cause. And if none of the existing opposition parties are stupid enough to take up that flag, the likelihood of them creating their own opposition party to raise that voice only increases. 

It is inevitable. The only way we have forward is to continue to show that they are a misguided minority in our society, and their views do not hold water in dictating how the country decides to treat FWs.",2020-06-02 15:17:48,reddit,didn need proof lol inevitable society hot mess discombobulating incoherent inconsistent ideas bottom line everyone voice everyone able influence outcome simultaneously empowering discouraging back 2011 influx labour not one largest election issue cost pap talented minister oh grc whatever since 2011 track clear blunt shift policy focused keeping fws away public eye little india riots didn help public furor cemented policy turn right thing avoid public outrage one persist laying feet pap saying pap abdicating moral responsibility etc another also make argument pap simply following democratic mandate listening people find hard accept denial voters back 2011 hand creating standard living fws experience consequently applauded outpouring goodwill fws saga inevitable pushback inevitable society hot mess response comment simply ignore people views inconsequential wrong no not democracy works voice opposition party temptation quick easy votes champion cause none existing opposition parties stupid enough take flag likelihood creating opposition party raise voice increases inevitable way forward continue show misguided minority society views not hold water dictating country decides treat fws

"> # Singapore sees record daily spike of 120 COVID-19 cases, 'significant number' linked to workers' dormitories

> SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 120 new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday (Apr 5), the biggest daily increase since the outbreak began here in January, bringing the national total to 1,309.

> Four of the new cases are imported and the remaining cases are locally transmitted.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> A ""significant number"" of the new cases are linked to existing clusters involving two workers' dormitories, S11 Dormitory @ Punggol and Westlite Toh Guan, said the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force in a press conference.

> S11 Dormitory @ Punggol has 22 new cases and Westlite Toh Guan has 10 new cases.

> 2 DORMS GAZETTED AS ISOLATION AREAS

> Given these figures, the Ministry of Health has gazetted the two dormitories as isolation areas.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> A total of 19,800 workers across the two dormitories have been placed under quarantine and will have to stay in their rooms for the next 14 days.

> Meals will be provided for the workers, as well as healthcare supplies including masks, thermometers and hand sanitiser, said the task force.

> Further safe distancing measures will also be implemented at all other worker dormitories, including staggering of meal times and minimising the inter-mingling of workers.

> However it should be made clear that foreign workers do not inherently have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong.

> ""It's not an issue of targeting a particular group, they are not of higher risk,"" said Mr Wong.

> ""The issue we have here is foreign worker dorms have now emerged as a cluster of infection, a new vector for transmission, despite the precautions we have taken.""

> Meanwhile the authorities are readying the Singapore Expo as a community care facility, according to Health Minister Gan Kim Yong.

> ""The Singapore Expo is being prepared as the next community care facility,"" he told reporters.

> These facilities are meant for housing patients who have more or less recovered but who could still be infectious, he added.

> Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had on Friday announced heightened safe distancing measures to act as a “circuit breaker” to curb the spread of COVID-19.

> Under the enhanced measures which will kick in next week, schools and workplaces – except those running essential services – will be closed for nearly a month until May 4. Food establishments will stay open only for takeaways or delivery.

> Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said on Sunday a third round of support measures will be rolled out to help businesses and households tide through these unprecedented “circuit breaker” measures.

> The “Solidarity Budget” will be announced when Parliament sits on Monday and comes less than two weeks after Mr Heng unveiled a record-breaking S$48 billion supplementary Budget.

"Thanks for your comments, they're very good points.

On OM, I see what you mean by the value in using it as a key indicator, but I would argue that CCL would also fall under the category of companies with low operating expenses. Comparing it to a similar asset class - the 3 largest Industrial REITs in Singapore, we see that CCL's OM is roughly in line with theirs, and indeed a little on the low side. Financing cost is also not included in OM.

**Operating Margin of Industrial REITs in Singapore (2017 - 2019)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Ascendas REIT**|73.30%|73.01%|73.56%|73.29%|
|**Mapletree Log REIT**|85.74%|84.48%|83.66%|84.62%|
|**Mapletree Ind REIT**|76.51%|76.43%|75.41%|76.12%|

This high OM seems to be mostly attributable to low depreciation costs. On depreciation, looking deeper CCL as a whole registered $3,113,000 (or 0.24% per annum) in depreciation expenses in 2019, of which only $607,000 (or 0.048% per annum) were attributable to their main assets, their buildings, on long-term property assets of $1,275,879,000 which seems a little low.

Agreed about looking at the data over a longer period of time.

"First of all, no one knows what the labor cost component of building HDB flats is. MND has never revealed the cost of building flats in Singapore. 

Secondly, if you increase the pay for doing dirty work, employers will shift to more automation and technology. For example, the construction industry has been using more prefab technology in recent years. Hence, you may not see a proportionate increase in the labor component of building costs even if you double FW salaries. 

Thirdly, MOM collects a shitload of levy for foreign workers. Why can't this money be returned to the FWs in the form of higher pay? With higher pay, you can attract better skilled workers and improve productivity. Right now, foreign workers in the construction industry use Singapore as a stepping stone to better paying jobs in the middle east. They come here for two years, get some skill upgrading and experience, and then go to Dubai.",2020-04-18 10:26:59,reddit,first no one knows labor cost component building hdb flats mnd never revealed cost building flats singapore secondly increase pay dirty work employers shift automation technology example construction industry using prefab technology recent years hence may not see proportionate increase labor component building costs even double salaries thirdly mom collects shitload levy money returned fws form higher pay higher pay attract better skilled improve productivity right construction industry use singapore stepping stone better paying jobs middle east come two years get skill upgrading experience go dubai

"-gue...igmcLuuodWKDsMQuote:This post is for those of you who somehow still don't understand how it is that China achieved getting the virus outbreak under control. There are no lies about it. There are no new cases and when a few crop up, the controls here are quickly put back in place. Our children are STILL not back to school even though there are no new cases. And this is even if President Trump wonders whether ""those numbers seem light"". I don't whether to laugh, cry or throw dishes at the wall.Here is exactly what we did and how we did it. (Living here for 21 years and having been here through the entire winter months up to now, I am extremely familiar with what has happened here on the ground along with thousands of other foreigners here as well, including our community through many of the chambers of commerce.) If you were also here in China during this time, then you fully understand this situation as well, please feel free to add anything I may have missed in the comments.1. The reason China does NOT have any new cases and got the virus completely under control in a few weeks is because even BEFORE any province had less than a hundred cases, the ENTIRE country was COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN. And EVERY person at all times outside wears a MASK. It is mandatory, not optional. What don't you understand about this crystal clear explanation?2. For example, here where we live in Liaoning province, we only had 89 cases and the ENTIRE province was shut down.3. ALL public transportation, EVERY retail shop, EVERY office building, EVERY school. EVERYTHING was ENTIRELY shutdown.4. The ONLY thing you could do was go to a nearby grocery store with temperature and QR scan controls to buy groceries. That's it. Every 3-4 days I went out to one of the two large markets that were open. On entering, they took your temperature and you scan the QR code to track where and when you were so they can back trace who you were in contact with later if you later developed symptoms.5. After shopping, then go back home and enjoy your self isolated. With your children at home because the schools were shut. It has been a struggle to keep Vincent busy in a routine, moving him from playtime to online courses to reading to playing downstairs. But we're doing great.6. THIS is what WE did for weeks. More importantly, THIS is what EVERY province across the ENTIRE country WITHOUT exception DID. This was provinces with very few cases.7. We didn't WAIT. The govt said do it, we did it. Its called civic duty and sacrifice to your community in the society in which you live.8. By end of February, most provinces had no new cases. All controls remain in place, now relaxed. If and when any small clusters of new cases pop up, those controls will instantly be turned ON again. So there will never be another large outbreak ever again anywhere in China.9. Updated here: As of now, all cities have rolled out the ""Green Health QR Code APP across China's cities. Every Chinese citizen has it on their mobile devices. Here in Shenyang, for example, you need to QR scan show your green health code when you enter the subway, or a mall. Simple. If for some reason, it is yellow you can 't go and if it is red, you belong at home in quarantine. The software works for foreigners in most cities. Here in Shenyang, it is not updated yet. So foreigners need to show their passport and register in a manual book in that case. (UPDATE the version that works for foreigners in Shenyang is now available) Perfect? Nope, definitely not. Annoying at times? Sure. But its a system in action being rolled out and tweaked at lightning speed across the country. Privacy? Hah, don't make me laugh. You better get over that one anywhere on planet earth.So now I want to ask you. DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE SILLY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY THERE ARE NO CASES HERE IN CHINA?Or do you still believe the latest CIA ""Intelligence"" report and other media on how things are still bad in China, which by the way are just trying to make you feel better about how bad things are there instead?And another point regarding all the cremation urns in Wuhan. This is because ALL people who had died from January 1st onward were never released during the outbreak lockdown period because, as I told you all businesses were shut down, which would include ceremony/cemetery services for urns. So it was a backlog of the normal # of people who die which is also thousands plus the virus patients who died.And on the millions of cell phones cancelled, that's because all the workers on very low salaries/income at home for 3 months cancelled their mobile subs to save money while they knew they were stuck at home for at least two months.Are you done speculating? I surely hope so.Thanks, God Bless, Go Home and Stay Home until the end of May and don't touch ANYTHING outside your home, Use sanitizer and wipes. Don't get near ANY PERSON whose history you don't know. Tough. Simple. Do It. I told you before, act like you're going camping for a few weeks.

But perhaps if the CB were introduced a bit earlier, when the virus first made it into the dorms it would be contained within the dorms only as workers can’t leave for day off.

>SAF bunks are quite similar; 50-100 men sharing the same toilet facilities, 10-20 men sleeping in bunks with beds separated 1-2 metres apart. However, NSFs and NSmen are probably better educated with regards to hygiene practices and precautions to be taken against the virus, and are also likely to be less clustered in general.

Hence the danger and potential for a cluster to form in camps. Also, i'm sure stand by bunks are being conducted more rigourously now but still...i wouldn't exactly trust the standards of a typical NSF haha.

">The problem is that theres uncertainties but govt is doing nothing to  help manage them while they're the ones causing it. Like when will this  cb end? When they said one month,  i think a lot of people were willing  to tahan and accept it, even those retailers. One month isnt that bad.  Then it became 2 while most of the cases werent in community but migrant  dorms. Then its 3. When community cases were 4 on average per day. If  we can't even open up at that number,  how can we be certain we will  ever hit phase 2 when phase 1 will definitely cause community cases to  go up?

To be fair, the whole situation is so fluid that no one can know what will happen. To say the government is not trying to help the retailers is also BS. The JSS scheme, rental waivers those are things that the government is trying to help businesses.

That said, there will be some business that will go bust because they were already tethering on the edge. As much as we would like to save all business, there is no way the government can do it.

"1) Literally difference in belief once again. Like I said, I don't believe in capitalism. Negative externalities will never be covered by the market, are you insane? How much compromised rivers and seas polluted by waste and natural water resources occupied by private enterprise do you need before you realize government intervention is needed to mitigate that shit?

2) Sure you can be critical, the hell are you on about. I didn't try to censure you or attack your freedom of speech. I can simply attempt to shoot down your criticism if it's a stupid criticism. I think your proposal that tech would magically solve the problem is unrealistic, and I think your proposal that simply putting in regulation is stupid. 

Your entire argument boils down to this: prodding the market will fix it.

You are underestimating the shithole the market is.

3) Again I think you're being dumb. You back yourself into a corner if you criticise coal but provide zero alternatives. What do you do when asked so what? You just tell them to have the market find alternative for you. Meanwhile the market is doing everything in their power to fund the notion that coal is a necessary evil through fudged bias studies, and that coal isn't that bad. 

That is not true. It's because of extremely convincing proposals that alternatives are viable and the cost will be lowered that countries adopted a different policy.

"> # COVID-19: Singapore confirms record 386 more cases, one additional death, and 4 new clusters; total at 2,918

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (13 April) confirmed a record daily rise of 386 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the total to 2,918 here.

> The announcement comes a day after authorities here announced 233 cases, the third single-day highest figure reported thus far, following last Thursday’s confirmation of 287 cases.

> On Sunday, 32 more patients have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, bringing the total of recovered patients to 560.

> Most of the 976 hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while 31 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. A total of 988 cases who are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19 are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Eight have died from complications due to COVID-19 infection, including a 90-year-old Singaporean man who succumbed to the disease on Saturday.

> At least 17 clusters linked to foreign worker dormitories have been identified thus far, including the largest cluster at S11 Dormitory@Punggol, which is linked to 365 cases.

> Eight such dorms have been gazetted as isolation areas, including the newly confirmed cluster at Acacia Lodge and Cochrane Lodge II.

> As of Sunday noon, the MOH has identified 28,140 close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 12,088 are currently quarantined, and 16,052 have completed their quarantine.

> As of 7 April noon, 72,680 swab tests have been carried out, of which 47,486 of them involved unique individuals. 

> The COVID-19 Temporary Measures Act, passed in Parliament on Tuesday, gives authorities the power to ban events and gatherings, or impose conditions on how they are conducted, during the “circuit breaker” period lasting till 4 May.

> Those caught flouting these regulations will be fined $300 and subsequently face prosecution for repeated offences.

> Under the Act, the penalty for first-time offenders is up to a $10,000 fine, a jail term of up to six months, or both. For second-time or subsequent offenders, the penalty is a fine of up to $20,000 along with a possible jail term of up to a year.

> People who flout their five-day medical leave or stay-home notices and do not wear masks if they have to leave their place of accommodation to seek emergency medical treatment are also subjected to similar penalties.

> Part of the “circuit breaker” measures – announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last Friday – include the closure of schools and most workplaces. Only essential services like food establishments, markets and supermarkets, transport, and key banking services will remain open during the month-long closure.

> In a Good Friday address, Lee reiterated his call for Singaporeans to stay home, as COVID-19 cases continue to rise in foreign worker dormitories as well as in the general population.

> Over the weekend, the authorities issued a slew of measures, including the closure of beaches, facilities in parks and gardens and playfields.

> Wearing masks was also made compulsory for commuters on public transport, as well as while those visiting supermarkets, convenience stores, pharmacies, and shopping malls.

> Stadiums have also been closed, while parents are not allowed to drop off their children with grandparents on a daily basis.

> Separately, all Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning from overseas apart from Hubei province must serve the 14-day stay-home notice, while those returning from Hubei must serve a 14-day quarantine.

> All short-term visitors are barred from entering or transiting via Singapore.

> On Monday, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced an additional $5.1 billion Solidarity Budget to help businesses, workers and households.

> The government’s response to COVID-19 will total $59.9 billion, or about 12 per cent of Singapore’s gross domestic product.

> To date, there are over 1.8 million COVID-19 cases globally. More than 115,000 have died from the virus, with the US holding the record for the highest global death toll at over 22,000.

> At over half a million cases, the country also holds the record of having the largest number of patients globally, followed by Spain at over 169,000 cases, Italy at over 156,000, followed by France at over 132,000.

> China, where the virus originated, has over 82,000 cases and earlier last Tuesday reported no new coronavirus deaths for the first time since it started publishing figures in January.

"Invisible hand of the market. 

The only things that I think government should directly intervene in are inelastic goods.

For Singapore, I refer to housing/medicine/food/water as inelastic. 

For the rest, the government should still regulate them but allow the market to run its course. If the regulations result in higher manpower costs, these costs will be transferred eventually onto the end consumer who consumes this product. 

For instance, if FW regulation leads to increase in manpower cost which leads to renovation becoming more expensive, then the end customers who want to use these FW for renovation will just have to pay more. 

I am not the one consuming a product based on the labour of these FWs. So why should my taxes go towards it?",2020-04-17 09:15:35,reddit,invisible hand market things think government should directly intervene inelastic goods singapore refer housing medicine food water inelastic rest government should still regulate allow market run course regulations result higher manpower costs costs transferred eventually onto end consumer consumes product instance regulation leads increase manpower cost leads renovation becoming expensive end customers want use renovation pay not one consuming product based labour fws should taxes go towards

"The cleanliness and sanitation at four of the foreign worker dormitories that have been gazetted as isolation areas has vastly improved, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Friday (Apr 10). In a media release, MOM said enhanced measures and cleaning routines had been put in place at the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, Westlite Toh Guan Dormitory, Toh Guan Dormitory and Sungei Tengah Lodge.At these isolation areas, workers are quarantined in their rooms for a two-week period as part of efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. They also receive onsite medical support and enhanced health screening.COVID-19 infections have spiked in foreign worker dormitories recently, with cases linked to 10 such dormitories across the island. Out of Singapore's 2,108 COVID-19 cases, more than 500 cases are linked to dormitories.Photos and videos circulating on social media earlier this week appeared to show crowded and unsanitary conditions at the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol -  currently the largest coronavirus cluster in Singapore, with 306 cases. MOM said it had instituted enhanced waste management and sanitation regimes at the four isolation areas. The frequency of refuse collection and removal from the premises for disposal have been increased from once a day to three to five times daily, depending on the premises, said the ministry. It noted that disinfection and cleaning of common areas and washroom facilities are also being carried out an average of thrice a day at the four isolation areas. These measures will also be introduced at the Tampines Dormitory - where are there currently 49 COVID-19 cases - which was also gazetted as the fifth such isolation area on Friday. MOM also noted that dormitory operators had been working with external vendors as well as in-house cleaners to improve the cleanliness and sanitation in the dorms. The measures taken include increasing the rounds of cleaning at the dormitories up to five times a day and getting additional to clean frequently used areas such as toilets and corridors. External vendors have also been engaged to clear rubbish at the isolation areas, as well as increasing the frequency of disinfecting from twice to four times daily.  MOM officers have been working round the clock at the dormitories gazetted as isolation areas to ensure the foreign workers well-being is taken care of and the living conditions are of the highest standards, said the ministry. It added it would act on feedback provided by dormitory residents to determine possible areas of improvements. In a video posted on his Facebook page on Friday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Singapore was paying close attention to the welfare of foreign workers, amid the COVID-19 outbreak. ""They came to Singapore to work hard for a living, and provide for their families back home ... We will do our best to take care of their health, livelihood and welfare here, and to let them go home, safe and sound,"" he said.-12631658I guess the bangala shld be happy that this virus helps to improve their standard of living conditions.",2020-11-04 10:34:00,hardwarezone,cleanliness sanitation four gazetted isolation areas vastly improved ministry manpower mom said friday apr 10 media release mom said enhanced measures cleaning routines put place s11 punggol westlite toh guan toh guan sungei tengah lodge isolation areas quarantined rooms two week period part efforts contain spread also receive onsite medical support enhanced health screening infections spiked recently linked 10 across island singapore 2 108 500 linked photos videos circulating social media earlier week appeared show crowded unsanitary conditions s11 punggol currently largest cluster singapore 306 mom said instituted enhanced waste management sanitation regimes four isolation areas frequency refuse collection removal premises disposal increased day three five times daily depending premises said ministry noted disinfection cleaning common areas washroom facilities also carried average thrice day four isolation areas measures also introduced tampines currently 49 also gazetted fifth isolation area friday mom also noted operators working external vendors well house cleaners improve cleanliness sanitation measures taken include increasing rounds cleaning five times day getting additional clean frequently used areas toilets corridors external vendors also engaged clear rubbish isolation areas well increasing frequency disinfecting twice four times daily mom officers working round clock gazetted isolation areas ensure well taken care living conditions highest standards said ministry added would act feedback provided residents determine possible areas improvements video posted facebook page friday prime minister lee hsien loong said singapore paying close attention welfare amid outbreak came singapore work hard living provide families back home best take care health livelihood welfare let go home safe sound said 12631658i guess bangala shld happy helps improve standard living conditions

Your worth should be evident, not during the good times but times like this adverse condition. It's fine if you and your government had erred but at least be accountable and apologetic, instead of going on your defence to give excuses. This is not the first time.

For at least once be bold enough to be accountable, apologetic and be outright about your next course of action. It's so easy for you and your government to point fingers at the opposition but get offended when fingers are pointed at you and be revengeful.

We interact very closely with the workers themselves, on a very regular basis at the dormitories, and even outside the dormitories whenever I'll ask teams, you know, follow up on their requests and feedback.I think what they’re focused on is how we can help them to handle this present situation, not fall sick, and if they fall sick, help take care of them, how to look after their wages being paid, how to ensure that they can send money home.These are the things that they have asked of us.

In the meantime, all the medical expenses (treatment and assessments) are borne by employers until the workman compensation is settled and the worker can be repatriated. Oh, also salary, upkeep, and accommodation.

"There are a lot of places [where work permit holders can live](-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/housing/various-types-of-housing). Some we don't normally think of, such as ""construction temporary quarters"" and ""temporary occupation license"". Only Malaysians and work permit holders in the services and manufacturing sectors are allowed to live in HDBs. Construction workers are not. The services and manufacturing work permit holders can only come from Malaysia, China, HK, Macau, South Korea, and Taiwan.

The vast majority of Singapore's cases are the intersection of three groups: construction workers, dorm-residents, and (unfortunately) Bangladeshi and Indian foreign workers. Most cases fall in all 3 groups; it's like a Venn diagram of 3 circles that mostly overlap. But there are, for example, PRC and Myanmarese construction workers who are dorm-residents who got it. 

Common sense suggests that most of these non-dorm WP holders are either construction workers (got it from colleagues) or Bangladeshi/Indian foreign workers (got it from friends), rather than completely new clusters of HDB-renters, as most people are imagining.

The MOH report on the 30th, when there were quite a lot of non-dorm WP cases, notes ""**The vast majority of these cases are workers in the construction sector serving their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) requirements**.""

 One such non-dorm WP cluster is [234 Balestier Road](-19-update-april-15-4-clusters/) (shophouses).

"Why the PAP has failed14 Feb - there was a foreign worker tested positive for COVID-19 and he was rushed into ICU a day later. 17 Feb - 2 more foreign workers were tested positive for the virus. 18 Feb - it was revealed that they formed a new cluster from a work site.News came out and employers rushed to send their foreign workers, who are unwell, to the hospital for a swab test.19 Feb - MOM published a news article from Mr Kelvin Teoh (divisional director of MOM for foreign workers) that employers must not send the foreign workers to the hospital or they may have their WORK PASS privileges suspended. Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet. The poor foreign workers in numbers of 300,000 became victims of the PAP government, due to their lack of hindsight and that huge stench of arrogance to listen to the public when many threads about the issue was raised in and around mid Feb. To this day, neither did Mr Kelvin Teoh nor Josephine Teo nor PAP Taskforce apologise to Singaporean and the foreign workers.(Saw this comment on fb)Lawrence Wong pointed out that previously, there have been cases in foreign worker dormitories.

"What most people fail to realise is that construction is actually an extremely low margin business. Average profit margins for large construction firms are 1.5-2% globally. Dorm operators enjoy considerably higher margins but they are often squeezed heavily by the main construction firms due to the aforementioned thin margins. 

In such a thin margin business, price increases are almost always passed on to the consumer. The competition in this industry is also nowhere near as intense as some of other large regulated industries (e.g. banks); and this further diminishes the bargaining power of consumers vis a vis companies.

Finally, as much as people demand better conditions for workers, most of us fail to put our money where our mouth is. Think of the sweatshop scandals from big firms like Apple, H&M, Nike etc. For all the feel-good ""demands"" for better worker conditions - people continue to purchase these companies' goods despite their perpetuation of these practices. Consumers need to vote with their dollars in terms of being willing to pay more for more ""ethically produced"" goods and services, not just their mouths - only then will things change.",2020-05-18 18:32:56,reddit,people fail realise construction actually extremely low margin business average profit margins large construction firms 1 5 2 globally operators enjoy considerably higher margins often squeezed heavily main construction firms due aforementioned thin margins thin margin business price increases almost always passed consumer competition industry also nowhere near intense large regulated industries e g banks diminishes bargaining power consumers vis vis companies finally much people demand better conditions us fail put money mouth think sweatshop scandals big firms like apple h nike etc feel good demands better conditions people continue purchase companies goods despite perpetuation practices consumers need vote dollars terms willing pay ethically produced goods services not mouths things change

"> # COVID-19: Singapore confirms 611 new cases, total at 33,860

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 611 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Friday (29 May) noon, bringing the total to 33,860.

> Of them, the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories, said the ministry, while three others are Singaporeans or permanent residents.

> It added that more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> This story will be updated later.

> MOH’S STATEMENT IN FULL

> From Monday, the MOH will publish a list of locations visited by cases in the community for over 30 minutes. This list – which excludes residences, workplaces, healthcare facilities, and public transport – will be updated on a rolling 14-days basis or one incubation period, the ministry said.

> As a precautionary measure, the MOH advised those who had been at these locations during the specified timings to monitor their health closely for 14 days from their date of visit.

> They have also been urged by the ministry to visit the doctor if they develop symptoms such as cough, sore throat, as well as fever and loss of taste or smell, and inform the doctor of their exposure history.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of over 2,600 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tuas View Dormitory and Jurong Penjuru Dormitory.

> The four are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some 400,000 foreign workers live in dorms here in Singapore.

> Some 20,000 infected foreign workers are expected to be discharged by the end of this month, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong at a press conference on 12 May.

> With 1,018 more cases of COVID-19 infection discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, a total of 18,294 cases – more than half of the total infections here – here have fully recovered from the infection, said the MOH on Thursday.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while seven are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Apart from 23 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, nine others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and two whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> It had also noted that 86 male foreign workers aged 25 to 59 died due to heart disease in Singapore in 2018.

> As of 25 May, the ministry has conducted 334,691 swab tests, of which 218,996 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 58,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 38,400 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

"I'm not sure how I'm insinuating it's a problem of race or nationality. It is a fact that the vast majority of people living in dorms where outbreaks are happening happen to be foreign workers, hence my use of the term ""foreign worker dorms"". If this leads you to believe I am attributing racial or national connotations to this, I will simply refer to it as the ""dorm problem"" to avoid confusion. 

My core claim remains unrefuted- that the dorm problem, by virtue of being the covid problem, affects Singaporeans, and hence is deserving of our tax money. If the situation calls for more money and attention, it should get it if it helps the dorm problem. I don't think I need to provide a full breakdown of where funds should go to make that point understandable. If my failure to do so makes you think this point is invalid, then I concede that it is invalid.

If you are of the belief that dorms which satisfy social distancing protocol are akin to those living in HDB in terms of covid risk, I don't know what to tell you. Look at pictures of foreign dorms - even the government-approved ones - they are nowhere near HDB level of distancing. I am not saying all dorm Operators are flouting the rules: I am saying following the rules still make them the most prone.

A misunderstanding on the last point then - I meant to say ""the level of government attention it is receiving currently.""

"Less revenue is your excuse to have people standing close in MRT? What’s the point of social distancing outside when running if you are going to have people cramped up in a train? That defeats the purpose. 

I am very concerned about the spread of virus. You seem to think because a place has been disinfected it can’t be infected again. I have news for you, any infected person touches the surface again when your disinfectant evaporates, can contaminate it! 

Buses and trains are ripe for it. Clusters get disinfected. Not every place an infected person has been. You can’t even trace every person you came into contact with, let alone every surface. Even in one city! You either think reality is a video game or we live in 2045. 

People are supposed to go out with masks. Most are, some are not. And wearing masks doesn’t mean you don’t touch surfaces or items in a supermarket. You don’t need to breathe in the virus. Touch is enough. Bring yourself up to speed.

By focusing on narratives to state foreign cases (all infected locally) are the problem because local cases are declining, the government is setting a bad expectation. One you have bought and refuse to budge from. You are entitled to believe what you want and see things your way. As I am. 

If you are unwilling to see obvious undertones in labeling workers staying in dorms as foreign cases separates from “local cases” whatever that means, you are part of the problem for me. So please suit yourself. You clearly lack understanding what news reporting does to people’s opinions, despite the fact that you are ample proof that the narrative is working, and you will argue endlessly to defend it.

"I’d like to know whether paying more would actually lead to the WORKERS being paid more, put in better living conditions and fed better food. And who is going to take up the task of ensuring that this is the case? Putting the extra money into an employers hands does not mean that the money will go down the ladder. We’ve already seen how for the last few years 2/3 of employers have been caught flouting the regulations, so who’s to say they won’t be taking the money? 

FWs would rarely speak up about this because they’re often banned from contacting NGOs for help, and may not even know about their rights or dare to fight back for fear of being sent home. Even if they win a case, the employer could simply shut down the company and empty the funds so that the worker gets paid no compensation. 

This is on top of all the pay transparency issues within the industry (no time logs, no breakdowns of their pay, being give significantly less than what they were initially offered, not even being paid sometimes and when owed too much money the employer just pack and leave).

"> # COVID-19: All foreign worker dormitories to be 'effectively' in lockdown - Josephine Teo

> SINGAPORE — All 43 purpose-built foreign workers dormitories here will soon be “effectively” on lockdown, affecting some 200,000 workers.

> During a virtual press conference led by the COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce on Tuesday (14 April), Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said that the authorities aim to apply the same safe distancing measures implemented in isolation areas to the remaining dorms.

> Thus far, eight dorms have been gazetted as isolation areas, with the latest being Cochrane Lodge II.

> “While these (other) dorms are not presented as isolation areas, we aim to apply the same safe distancing measures so that they are effectively also on lockdown,” said Teo.

> Some 7,000 healthy workers who are providing essential services have already been moved out of the dormitories.

> They would be placed at various activated sites such as SAF military camps, the Changi Exhibition Centre, floating hotels, or floatels, that are typically used for offshore accommodation, as well as vacant Housing Board blocks in Tanjong Pagar and Jurong.

> About 1,300 healthy workers will be progressively relocated in batches to three floating hotels berthed at Tanjong Pagar Terminal over the next few weeks. The first batch of 31 healthy workers have been moved to a floatel.

> At least 19 clusters linked to foreign worker dormitories have been identified as of Monday night, including the largest cluster of 586 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol.

> Those linked to S11 account for nearly half of the total 1,193 cases linked to clusters at foreign worker dorms and construction sites.

> On Tuesday, the Ministry of Health’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak said there were another 334 new cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore, taking the total to 3,252.

"Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo on Tuesday (Apr 14) thanked foreign workers for their hard work in Singapore and their cooperation as the country fights to curb the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak.In a video, Mrs Teo extended her Tamil New Year greetings to foreign workers in Singapore, wishing them good health.""Today is the start of the new year for you, but it is difficult to celebrate without family and friends,"" said Mrs Teo in the video.""The COVID-19 outbreak has affected all of us, but I know it is especially hard for you. I want to thank you for all your hard work in Singapore and for your cooperation during this period.""On behalf of all Singaporeans, I wish you good health in the new year. Stay safe for your families, stay safe for your friends,"" she said.Ministry of Communications and Information of Mr Iswaran, who also appeared in the video, also paid tribute to foreign workers for their contribution to Singapores development and growth.Amid COVID-19, Mr Iswaran said he understood the foreign workers concerns about their wages and that is why the government is working with their employers to ensure that they will continue to be paid in this period.We are also making arrangements to ensure that you get the necessary healthcare and also the services for food and for your accommodation, and also for the larger needs in terms of IT and Wi-Fi connectivity so that you can stay connected to your families, he added.Singapore has put in place strict safe distancing measures during what it calls a circuit breaker period to stem the spread of COVID-19. The measures - which include shutting down non-essential workplaces and schools - will be in place for one month until May 4.A large number of Singapore's recent COVID-19 cases have been from foreign worker dormitories.Several dormitories have been declared as isolation areas, meaning residents have to be quarantined in their rooms.Concerns have been raised about the welfare of foreign workers in dormitories, and the ability of dorm operators to implement COVID-19 safe distancing measures, with photos and videos circulating online of crowded and unsanitary conditions.The Ministry of Manpower has since stepped in to help manage the situation - saying it has ensured better distribution and quality of meals, as well as improved waste management and hygiene conditions.Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said on Sunday that the Government has short-term and long-term plans in place to improve conditions at foreign worker dormitories.In the immediate term, the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force has set up a special group to look at the measures needed for foreign worker dormitories, said Mr Heng.This includes raising standards of cleanliness and hygiene and reducing the concentration of foreign workers in the dormitories, said Mr Heng, adding that authorities are looking into housing foreign workers in other facilities.Mr Iswaran said on Tuesday that the implementation of circuit breaker measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 had imposed much inconvenience and challenges for all, but that it was important for everyone to work together.It is important that all of us whether we are citizens, permanent residents, or workers from overseas like you, that we all come together and do our part so that we can overcome this challenge, he said.He wished them a Happy New Year, Happy Vishu and Happy Vaisakhi.-12638796",2020-04-14 11:28:00,hardwarezone,minister manpower josephine teo tuesday apr 14 thanked hard work singapore cooperation country fights curb spread outbreak video mrs teo extended tamil new year greetings singapore wishing good health today start new year difficult celebrate without family friends said mrs teo video outbreak affected us know especially hard want thank hard work singapore cooperation period behalf singaporeans wish good health new year stay safe families stay safe friends said ministry communications information mr iswaran also appeared video also paid tribute contribution singapore development growth amid mr iswaran said understood concerns wages government working employers ensure continue paid period also making arrangements ensure get necessary healthcare also services food accommodation also larger needs terms wi fi connectivity stay connected families added singapore put place strict safe distancing measures calls circuit breaker period stem spread measures include shutting non essential workplaces schools place one month may 4 large number singapore recent several declared isolation areas meaning residents quarantined rooms concerns raised welfare ability operators implement safe distancing measures photos videos circulating online crowded unsanitary conditions ministry manpower since stepped help manage situation saying ensured better distribution quality meals well improved waste management hygiene conditions deputy prime minister heng swee keat said sunday government short term long term plans place improve conditions immediate term multi ministry task force set special group look measures needed said mr heng includes raising standards cleanliness hygiene reducing concentration said mr heng adding authorities looking housing facilities mr iswaran said tuesday implementation circuit breaker measures contain spread imposed much inconvenience challenges important everyone work together important us whether citizens permanent residents overseas like come together part overcome challenge said wished happy new year happy vishu happy vaisakhi 12638796

"Oh alright, I kinda get what you mean.

His point here is to use your basic instincts to figure out the validity (ie someone making sense) of each arguments presented, not really about the legality. 

For example, the point he mentioned was 'if the dorms were better (of the conditions) the situation be better'. In this case, to evaluate if the argument is valid, draw on your own experiences, instincts to see if the situation is dependent on living conditions.

If you have lived in a clean environment but still got sick easily (or lived in a dirty environment but never got sick much) then your basis is that the covid situation in dorms is not necessarily dependent on living conditions.

If you have lived in a clean environment and never got sick much and then lived in a dirty environment and got sick frequently, pr vice versa, then your basis is that the covid situation in dorms is very likely linked to living conditions.

These examples and analysis show that basic instincts may not encroach into the issues of legality. 

Basic instincts don't always have to mean a right or wrong, but more on what makes more sense to the person thinking. It can be right from Person A's POV, but wrong from Person B's POV. 

Many things as derived from first principles is relative, and legality also.",2020-05-25 12:14:29,reddit,oh alright kinda get mean point use basic instincts figure validity ie someone making sense arguments presented not really legality example point mentioned better conditions situation better case evaluate argument valid draw experiences instincts see situation dependent living conditions lived clean environment still got sick easily lived dirty environment never got sick much basis situation not necessarily dependent living conditions lived clean environment never got sick much lived dirty environment got sick frequently pr vice versa basis situation likely linked living conditions examples analysis show basic instincts may not encroach issues legality basic instincts always mean right wrong makes sense person thinking right person pov wrong person b pov many things derived first principles relative legality also

"I live nearby. I mentioned it in one of my previous post a few days ago. 

Honestly, I’m glad they’re doing this because we know that special times call for special needs. We also know that these blocks were going to be torn down and were kind of sad cos they’re an icon of the neighbourhood but efforts to save them went unheard. So it’s kind of nice that these blocks can have a final lease of life before they’re gone. 

As a nearby resident, my worry was that if they bring the virus over from the dorms, it’s too close to home. At the very least there needs to be a proper barrier from the residential communities (I know, this sounds like putting them in jail but hear me out). These blocks are right next to elderly rental flats, home of the most vulnerable group of people in this COVID crisis. It’s also right next to Redhill market, where many elderly come from other neighborhoods even to do their daily grocery shopping. It’s also literally 3 minutes away from the MRT station. My worry is that if they don’t follow the rules of lockdown, spreading the virus around the neighbourhood would have dire consequences given the average aged population here. 

Which is why I’m glad to see that the authorities have set up a barricade around the blocks so that the entry and exit points are limited and more importantly, controlled. It’s not ideal but it’s a compromise I think we all have to accept in special times like these. From what I understand, They are still able to come out of the residences to make essential purchases so they are not say utter lack of freedom like a convict. They have to follow lockdown rules like the rest of us so we are as much a convict in our own homes as they are.

So ya, to address some of your concerns (specifically the downvotes guy who talked about property prices and deleted his comment while I was typing reply to him so I’m reposting this as a parent comment instead), most residents here are understanding enough to know whats going on and we applaud this measure taken. We know it’s only short term, and we care less about property prices and more about the virus spreading as new elements are introduced in the neighbourhood and we don’t know for sure how things will play out. 

Ps: they’ve been working on this for weeks now, so please do give the govt some credit here. They did not as some have claimed, do nothing for the dorm workers, but instead have been working quietly in the background until things are up and and running before they announce it. I can assure you first hand based on the massive effort and how long they took to refit the place, that **they’ve been working on this waaaaayyy before the recent clusters at the dorms broke out (less the initial cluster at S11 at Seletar).** In fact, they’ve only moved in two days ago to the first few flats which are ready, they’re still working on the other blocks in the precinct at this very moment. That’s how massive this whole project is.",2020-04-08 17:21:26,reddit,live nearby mentioned one previous post days ago honestly glad know special times call special needs also know blocks going torn kind sad cos icon neighbourhood efforts save went unheard kind nice blocks final lease life gone nearby resident worry bring close home least needs proper barrier residential communities know sounds like putting jail hear blocks right next elderly rental flats home vulnerable group people crisis also right next redhill market many elderly come neighborhoods even daily grocery shopping also literally 3 minutes away mrt station worry follow rules lockdown spreading around neighbourhood would dire consequences given average aged population glad see authorities set barricade around blocks entry exit points limited importantly controlled not ideal compromise think accept special times like understand still able come residences make essential purchases not say utter lack freedom like convict follow lockdown rules like rest us much convict homes ya address concerns specifically downvotes guy talked property prices deleted comment typing reply reposting parent comment instead residents understanding enough know whats going applaud measure taken know short term care less property prices spreading new elements introduced neighbourhood know sure things play ps working weeks please give govt credit not claimed nothing instead working quietly background things running announce assure first hand based massive effort long took refit place working waaaaayyy recent clusters broke less initial cluster s11 seletar fact moved two days ago first flats ready still working blocks precinct moment massive whole project

"-highligh...er-dormitories5TH APR 2020    The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) had issued advisories on enhanced precautionary measures in dormitories to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission. However transmissions within foreign worker dormitories have continued to rise and we are seeing more confirmed cases and workers who are ill. The S11 Dormitory @ Punggol (2 Seletar North Link) and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory (18 Toh Guan Road East) are of particular concern.2.    The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has decided that further measures are necessary to contain the risk of further transmission among the foreign workers within these two dormitories. This would keep the workers safe, as well as protect the wider community from widespread transmission from these clusters. Both S11 Dormitory @ Punggol and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory have been declared as isolation areas. Onsite medical support has been deployed, along with provision of food and essential supplies.Measures to contain further outbreak3.    The S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, with 13,000 resident workers, and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory, with 6,800 resident workers, have been gazetted as isolation areas. Given the rising number of confirmed cases, this is necessary to avoid the risk of further transmissions from any potentially infected workers to others in the dormitories, as well as into the community. Workers who are symptomatic have already been isolated.4.    Within these two dormitories, precautionary steps have also been taken to protect workers who are well. All the affected workers will not go to work. Access to recreational facilities will be regulated to reduce the inter-mixing of workers. Movement between blocks is prohibited. Workers have also been advised to cease social interactions with others who do not reside in the same room or floor.5.    MOM is working closely with all dormitory operators, to implement similar measures within their premises with immediate effect. Efforts are also underway in the larger dormitories to reduce the density of their resident workers, by transferring some among them to alternative accommodation during this period.Support provided to workers6.    The workers will continue to be paid their salaries for the duration of the quarantine. Their period of absence from work is treated as paid hospitalisation leave as part of the workers leave eligibility under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA). Their employers are eligible to claim for the $100 daily quarantine allowance.7.    Arrangements will be made to cater three meals a day for all affected workers for the duration of the quarantine. They will also be issued with reusable masks, surgical masks, thermometers, hand sanitisers and other essentials so they can keep themselves safe and comfortable.8.    Onsite medical support has been deployed to support the workers residing at both dormitories. The dormitories have also implemented enhanced health screening measures, such as requiring workers to check and report their temperature twice daily, as well as the regular monitoring for fever and respiratory symptoms. Those who are unwell will be isolated and will be assessed by medical personnel for further attention. Support provided to companies with affected workers9.    Companies that are providing essential services with workers affected by this quarantine order will be supported and arrangements will be made to ensure these essential services can continue to be provided.Advisory to dormitory operators10.   Dormitory operators and workers living in dormitories are reminded of the importance of maintaining high standards of hygiene and cleanliness to safeguard their own health and those of others who are living in the same space. Safe distancing measures must be strictly adhered to. These include measures such as no inter-mixing of workers between dormitory blocks and floors, and for workers to stay within their rooms and to minimise interactions.11.   Social responsibility is critical in slowing the transmission of the virus. We need every individual to play their part in the fight against the virus. Those who are unwell, even with mild flu-like symptoms, should not be at work. They must see a doctor immediately to prevent spreading illness to others.MINISTRY OF HEALTH & MINISTRY OF MANPOWER5 APRIL 2020wow.. 100 per day? do the employers even pay the workers that much?",2020-05-04 19:53:00,hardwarezone,highligh er dormitories5th apr 2020 ministry manpower mom issued advisories enhanced precautionary measures minimise risk transmission however transmissions within continued rise seeing confirmed ill s11 punggol 2 seletar north link westlite toh guan 18 toh guan road east particular concern 2 multi ministry taskforce decided measures necessary contain risk transmission among within two would keep safe well protect wider community widespread transmission clusters s11 punggol westlite toh guan declared isolation areas onsite medical support deployed along provision food essential supplies measures contain outbreak3 s11 punggol 13 000 resident westlite toh guan 6 800 resident gazetted isolation areas given rising number confirmed necessary avoid risk transmissions potentially infected others well community symptomatic already isolated 4 within two precautionary steps also taken protect well affected not go work access recreational facilities regulated reduce inter mixing movement blocks prohibited also advised cease social interactions others not reside room floor 5 mom working closely operators implement similar measures within premises immediate effect efforts also underway larger reduce density resident transferring among alternative accommodation period support provided workers6 continue paid salaries duration quarantine period absence work treated paid hospitalisation leave part leave eligibility employment manpower act efma employers eligible claim 100 daily quarantine allowance 7 arrangements made cater three meals day affected duration quarantine also issued reusable masks surgical masks thermometers hand sanitisers essentials keep safe comfortable 8 onsite medical support deployed support residing also implemented enhanced health screening measures requiring check report temperature twice daily well regular monitoring fever respiratory symptoms unwell isolated assessed medical personnel attention support provided companies affected workers9 companies providing essential services affected quarantine order supported arrangements made ensure essential services continue provided advisory operators10 operators living reminded importance maintaining high standards hygiene cleanliness safeguard health others living space safe distancing measures must strictly adhered include measures no inter mixing blocks floors stay within rooms minimise interactions 11 social responsibility critical slowing transmission need every individual play part fight against unwell even mild flu like symptoms should not work must see doctor immediately prevent spreading illness others ministry health ministry manpower5 april 2020wow 100 per day employers even pay much

"I think it's good from a purely scientific perspective. I work in physics, so I try to understand things through that lens. This is a few weakly coupled systems; the dorms is weakly coupled to the wider population. The coupling goes via one of two routes: non-dorm FWs, and healthcare/isolation facility workers. Separating non-dorm FWs is a good proxy for the coupling strength, which I'm sure MOH keeps an eye on. 

In addition, non-dorm FWs themselves are weakly coupled, cause in this case most of those infected are construction industry FWs living in non-dorm residences, such as on-site or shophouses. They're locked down too, so they should be considered a third category, weakly coupled to the other two.",2020-05-10 23:38:54,reddit,think good purely scientific perspective work physics try understand things lens weakly coupled systems weakly coupled wider population coupling goes via one two routes non fws healthcare isolation facility separating non fws good proxy coupling strength sure moh keeps eye addition non fws weakly coupled cause case infected construction industry fws living non residences site shophouses locked should considered third category weakly coupled two

"I made this graph for those who have been trying to grapple with estimating the risk to the general public as cases have been exploding. A lot of these cases are probably happening in foreign worker dorms and construction sites, relatively ""isolated"" from the general public, but MOH has not provided a breakdown.

I did this using the data at  []()  and ordering by local transmission and nationality. Classifying whether a case is likely linked to a foreign worker dorm or construction site is inexact. Basically all Bangladeshi adult males are assumed to be dorm-related; I also classified all Indian (nationality) males confirmed after Mar-31 to be dorm-related. China nationals and Myanmar nationals were only classified as dorm-related if they were officially linked. Obviously there could be errors.

The spike at 7th April is horrifying. It is a sum of what was announced on 7th April, plus a lot of cases announced yesterday were actually attributed to the 7th. This way of announcing also means that a lot more cases confirmed yesterday could be added today; this is not a real dip.

"1) Bringing in 10 foreign workers using a hammer is just disingenuous to the work they are doing. Give some actual level of research if you want to make a proposal that upgrading tech will significantly reduce the need for foreign workers.

How many skilled workers are needed to operate the vehicle, what is the lump-sum cost of investment and what is the upkeep cost? How much can you save with this technological upgrade that will eliminate maybe half of foreign worker workforce? How much training is necessary and how long will it take to implement?

""Just upgrade lah"" is something you hear too often from ignorant bosses and ignorant masses. It provides absolutely zero solution, and zero steps towards the solution. Ideas are cheap, execution is everything.

2) I can agree with this. However, you talk about capitalism in your third point. Don't allow the successful to have landed property, lose the successful. This disgusting world you are living in is controlled by the 1%.

Then again, how much landed space do you really think that will clear up?  I don't think that shit will be the solution to this problem here.

3) You don't need to solve the problem, but unless you actually tried to tackle the problem you don't understand why this is a problem that's so damned hard to solve. Logistic is everything. Your ""maybe"" doesn't actually do anything. What is to say that they won't just make things unnecessarily harder on FW?

"I’m more worried that they do not have trust in the system when the authorities go in to handle the situation.

When there’s a confirmed cluster and advice has been given to reduce social distancing, why are some of them still standing at the corridors looking down on crowds congregating on the ground floor? That’s only going to worsen the outbreak. 

My NS and reservist was served in a compound with just such living conditions. 
The bunk beds were packed so close together that I could touch the edge neighboring bunk bed when I reach my arms out from my bed. There was no metal cabinets between as there was just no space for it. 
There was a table in the middle of the room but if people were to sit there, you wouldn’t be able to walk to the other side of the room - you had to walk out of the room and go to the other side via the corridor. 
As NSFs we brought in our own fans as the air circulation in the room was just shit. 
During reservist, the building I was housed in had problematic pipes. You’d better be the first or second batch of people to bathe as the whole bathing area will be flooded up to the ankle if you were slow. 


As much as the foreign workers are housed in less than ideal conditions that many of us wouldn’t want to live in given a choice, they made the choice to come to Singapore to earn money. There are conscripts who have to spend 2 years of their lives in such conditions as well, without a choice.",2020-04-08 09:44:32,reddit,worried not trust system authorities go handle situation confirmed cluster advice given reduce social distancing still standing corridors looking crowds congregating ground floor going worsen outbreak ns reservist served compound living conditions bunk beds packed close together could touch edge neighboring bunk bed reach arms bed no metal cabinets no space table middle room people sit wouldn able walk side room walk room go side via corridor nsfs brought fans air circulation room shit reservist building housed problematic pipes better first second batch people bathe whole bathing area flooded ankle slow much housed less ideal conditions many us wouldn want live given choice made choice come singapore earn money conscripts spend 2 years lives conditions well without choice

"Just a tiny virus karang Kabo.If war time all just hug n cry in parliammentAs the global infection rate and death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic race upwards, people are playing the blame game, and it’s resulting in fraught relations and strained bilateral ties.Thanks to Lawrence Wong’s words, “hindsight” is now a word in popular usage. It’s easy for people to criticize their govts’ handling of the virus outbreak, but they have the wisdom of hindsight. And with hindsight, govts and their virus-fighting task force can now see there were alternatives and they would do things differently. What is easy to notice in hindsight was, alas, not at all obvious at the time. Everybody can be wise after the event.Those who have foresight are a rare breed while those who have the benefit of past experiences of virus outbreaks or have read a lot about them are plentiful. The former are foresighted, original thinkers who foresee warning signs and may come up with proactive steps to combat the coronavirus. The latter, with the advantage of hindsight, are able to dispense good advice, and I’ve seen plenty of such concerned, well-meant folks advising others to wear mask always, minimize social contact, avoid the crowds, dissolve crowded living conditions and so on and so forth. Their ideas were derived from previous epidemic experiences, thus they aren’t original.Mr Lawrence’s statement of “not having the luxury of the benefit of hindsight” is, to all intents and purposes, an admission of the authorities’ lack of foresight. Maybe the elected representatives of the people are somewhat good at governing the country, but when it comes to snuffiing out an unknown, invisible enemy that remains elusive and a real handful, they’re found wanting. It’s a difficult warfare, when you think about it, fighting public enemy number one not on the battle field but by staying at home! Not surprisingly, some countries have actually thrown in the towel.  With Lawrence’s admission of failure, shall we overlook their lack of success, at least for now?",2020-11-04 02:00:00,sgtalk,tiny karang kabo war time hug n cry parliammentas global infection rate death toll pandemic race upwards people playing blame game resulting fraught relations strained bilateral ties thanks lawrence wong words hindsight word popular usage easy people criticize govts handling outbreak wisdom hindsight hindsight govts fighting task force see alternatives would things differently easy notice hindsight alas not obvious time everybody wise event foresight rare breed benefit past experiences outbreaks read lot plentiful former foresighted original thinkers foresee warning signs may come proactive steps combat latter advantage hindsight able dispense good advice seen plenty concerned well meant folks advising others wear mask always minimize social contact avoid crowds dissolve crowded living conditions forth ideas derived previous epidemic experiences thus original mr lawrence statement not luxury benefit hindsight intents purposes admission authorities lack foresight maybe elected representatives people somewhat good governing country comes snuffiing unknown invisible enemy remains elusive real handful found wanting difficult warfare think fighting public enemy number one not battle field staying home not surprisingly countries actually thrown towel lawrence admission failure shall overlook lack success least

"Ironic that almost everything you said can be used right back at your own comment. There's zero analysis in your comments too and nothing specific to this article either. Your initial comment is nothing but an edgy opinion to maybe try and virtue signal about how woke you are wrt the press freedom in SG. 

Nice strawman btw, imagine picking on the semantics about the middle east death camps. Is that an exaggeration? Yes. But so is the point the article made about the hygiene standard about the ALL the dorms in the SG. My point if you actually bothered the rest of my comment instead of just focusing on the semantics is that it's unfair of the article to lump ALL the dorms together as lacking the proper standards. It is one of the contributing factors for sure but there is definitely a sense of inevitability given how densely packed we are as a nation. 

Again you only choose to see in my comments what you wanna see. I give credit where credit is due in the article nowhere did I imply that it's an us against them type of mentality. In fact you're the only one that seems to be projecting that right now given how defensive you're getting. Is some of the criticism warranted?

"""they didn't know the risk"" might be letting them off way too lightly.

in 2015 when the dorms bill was passed, multiple MPs mentioned outbreaks of infectious diseases.

  
**Mr Gan Thiam Poh:** Whether it is a smaller dorm with a few hundred residents or a bigger one with 1,000, similar problems could arise. In the event of an infectious disease outbreak, racial or national tension, for example, the tipping point can be reached at 100 or 200 workers. 

**Yeo Guat Kwang:** the licensing framework will no doubt enhance the ability to deal with large-scale public and personal security, and even health and also pandemic incidents arising within dormitories. 

**Lee Bee Wah:** I would think putting a few hundred people under a roof is a sizeable crowd. It poses challenges to manage even with just 50 people under one roof, from fire safety, cooking area, toilets to space for clothes. Failure to manage the living quarters of a few hundred people can certainly give way to problems in terms of public health and safety, security and public order.

**Ms Foo Mee Har:** I am also pleased with the requirement for sick bay isolation facilities to contain any infectious disease outbreak, which could spread quickly in a densely populated dormitory.

**Tan Chuan Jin:** We are also aware of healthcare concerns. For smaller dorms or smaller accommodation spaces, when outbreaks happen, you can manage it, you have quarantine. But when you have a much larger dorm, the requirements are quite different, the scale is very different. We need to weave this into the design of the dormitories themselves.",2020-04-17 01:06:08,reddit,didn know risk might letting way lightly 2015 bill passed multiple mps mentioned outbreaks infectious diseases mr gan thiam poh whether smaller hundred residents bigger one 1 000 similar problems could arise event infectious disease outbreak racial national tension example tipping point reached 100 200 yeo guat kwang licensing framework no doubt enhance ability deal large scale public personal security even health also pandemic incidents arising within lee bee wah would think putting hundred people roof sizeable crowd poses challenges manage even 50 people one roof fire safety cooking area toilets space clothes failure manage living quarters hundred people certainly give way problems terms public health safety security public order ms foo mee har also pleased requirement sick bay isolation facilities contain infectious disease outbreak could spread quickly densely populated tan chuan jin also aware healthcare concerns smaller smaller accommodation spaces outbreaks happen manage quarantine much larger requirements quite different scale different need weave design

"Did you honestly think MOM/MOH failed to foresee this? They probably did because every individual in Singapore had a higher probability to be infected when we allowed tens of thousands of msians to come into Singapore when MCO was implemented there as well as the returning Singaporeans from abroad. None of the msians served a 14 day SHN while it took some time before returning citizens were quarantined in hotels. Some clusters have already formed there and then and it's untraceable. Could even be linked originally from Msia/western countries.

Especially so for the FW workers who may be dealing with medical waste or waste in general. Used masks from an unknowingly infected carrier etc.. Transmission in this case was inevitable but our strategy in dealing with the virus at that time was reactive to the facts present at hand...

TBH I'm sure they were probably just crossing their fingers that the virus doesn't get to our FW workers dormitories. How could they not foresee? Social distancing was already being preached before the spread in the dormitories and any retard in MOM can tell you that those dormitories are not benchmarks of safe distancing.

It was just that the authorities are just biding their time waiting for it to happen before they 'react' to the 'facts' once again. For years MOM has nv really been a champion of FW rights. It's really evident now because you see all the dirt surfacing about how they are treated by their employers and how dorm operators are allowed to get away scot free for their deplorable management. It really is a case of out of sight out of mind. It has really been rotten for quite awhile and this covid19 truly brought out the stink.

Seriously there needs to be heavy enforcement and penalties for errant employers not just those of FW labourers but those of any immigrant (hello fake degree mills). What we lack sorely is an independent ombudsman that doesn't scream conflict of interest. We really exposed ourselves greatly when we allowed such a sizeable workforce from Msia to enter or risk crippling our economy. We have become far too dependent on cheap labour. It's a sick addiction. We need to think about what life's like without them. I'm not advocating for an exodus but a healthy sizeable reduction where we can still stand on our 2 feet or at least hobble along. Delicate balancing act way above my pay grade. Simply put, businesses have to innovate and invest towards less labour intensive technologies because it's damn certain no Singaporean can compete with the wages of a msian living in msia. Its simple mathematics.

PA grassroots leaders helloooo?? Too many scratching of backs within our govt and associated businesses. We need proper investigative journalism to call out these folks because they have sat on their high horses far too long to the detriment of greater society. In short.. follow the money.

I'm more pissed at MOM allowing the labour situation to be the state it is in now then the covid19 numbers. It was a time bomb that has been ticking for years prior to this. The reform doesn't just need to come in addressing migrant workers' living and working conditions in the near immediate future but as well our will to wean ourselves off cheap foreign labour so that we are not vulnerable to their absence as well as making businesses pay a liveable wage to the local workforce. It should also be legislated that no CEO should earn 1000 times the lowest paid employee to push for a more equitable distribution of wealth within a company. I have a dream...

In a dark way I'm kinda glad that covid19 has happened the way it did if not all these issues will never come to light and remain under the rug. It will definitely cause many countries around the world to look inwards as well and we are no exception. This globalisation machine needs some major recalibration before more Trump-like politics take over the world and I'm speaking as someone who is pro globalisation.

PAP's intention of capitalising on this period to hold elections to have us riding on the ""feel good"" wave when our numbers were not that crappy have backfired big time. It really speaks of their arrogance in insulting our intelligence. They did the same with LKY's death back in 2015 to great success. There are so many domestic issues to be debated and addressed before voters can exercise their rights in an informed manner. But I'm also guessing their arrogance is fuelled by our political ignorance. So people need to be less apolitical unless you're on either side of the camp no matter what. There should be more than one voice in a healthy society were the words muttered by the chinese Dr. Li Wenliang who blew the whistle on this virus.

> The treatment these workers have received is in stark contrast to the fate of such workers in many other countries where they have been given short shrift.

> Singapore has supplied food, shelter, wage payment, medical treatment and other comforts.

> In some instances, the food was not suitable for some of the workers, and pictures of discarded food were shared. This was rectified the following day after feedback from the workers.

> I feel that the government response has been measured and correct regarding the epidemiological aspects, and the humanitarian measures are truly second to none.

> I was aghast on Monday when Nominated MP Anthea Ong asked the Government to apologise for the handling of the migrant workers.

> I believe this pandemic requires full support from all and any attempts at grandstanding or ""actionism"" should be curbed at source.

">**But guess what? The workers will still be eating together and working together. Do people understand how infectious this virus is? Even healthcare workers in full PPE can still catch it. Confirm will still kenna. Who are we kidding?** 

For someone who claims to know statistics well, Ben really has a very poor understanding with how infections and distancing work. From a large population standpoint, infections are **not** a ""one-and-done"" deal. Statistics is hard to understand, but let me break it down for everyone. When you social distance for 23 hours a day, just because for the last hour you have dinner with friends, it doesnt mean that those 23 hours are somehow ""wasted"". If that were the case, we would ban everyone from leaving home even for groceries. 

Instead, the **probability** of you catching the virus has been lowered through distancing. Instead of 100 social interactions a day, distancing lowers that number to 1. Now your probability of getting infected is reduced by 99%. It doesnt stay at 100% just because you had that 1 social interaction. 

Its stupid to think that the **probability** of catching and spreading the virus would still be the same just because people **work and eat together.** 

If dorms had more space, we could have reduced the probability of FWs catching and spreading the disease. On a population-level, this would translate to concrete and significant reductions in the number of people infected. Ben Leong is a joke of a prof if he cant understand simple laws of probability and chance. 

TLDR; Distance reduces the probability of getting infected and spreading infections. Taken a large population sample, this translates to actual concrete reduced numbers.",2020-05-25 13:19:02,reddit,guess still eating together working together people understand infectious even healthcare full ppe still catch confirm still kenna kidding someone claims know statistics well ben really poor understanding infections distancing work large population standpoint infections not one done deal statistics hard understand let break everyone social distance 23 hours day last hour dinner friends doesnt mean 23 hours somehow wasted case would ban everyone leaving home even groceries instead probability catching lowered distancing instead 100 social interactions day distancing lowers number 1 probability getting infected reduced 99 doesnt stay 100 1 social interaction stupid think probability catching spreading would still people work eat together space could reduced probability fws catching spreading disease population level would translate concrete significant reductions number people infected ben leong joke prof cant understand simple laws probability chance tldr distance reduces probability getting infected spreading infections taken large population sample translates actual concrete reduced numbers

"It’s alarming how the government is pushing the narrative that foreign worker cases are significantly increasing but community transmission is decreasing. They can call it “local transmission” if that helps. 

Isn’t the infection of thousands of these workers the result of “community transmission”? How did they get it from one another? Local transmission of course. 

Calling it foreign cases only alludes to the fact that they are foreigners. But they live on the same land as you, and got the cases here locally! 

The Govt logic is simple: if you discount these workers as members of the community, you can report low community transmission. Problem solved. 

It’s truly pathetic that the people who live in ivory towers and take pride in the magnificent infrastructure of Singapore have no regard for those who built them! 

Take your money and shut up. If you behave in a way that undermines the Govt, all the money will be taken back. And without the money, what else is there in life? It’s hard to argue with people who take home hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. They can’t see beyond that money. So unless you have much of it, your life isn’t worth much.

"SINGAPORE  Foreign workers have been in the authorities sight early on in the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore at the start of the year, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on Monday (4 May).Delivering a ministerial statement in Parliament, she explained how the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) helped to prevent imported cases by limiting the return of work pass holders and monitoring returnees compliance with Leaves of Absence and Stay-Home Notices, among other things.Throughout this period, migrant workers were also on our radar, said Teo.Back in January, soon after the multi-ministry task force was set up, MOM reached out to dormitory operators to be more vigilant and to step up hygiene. In fact, one of the earliest media conferences that Minister Lawrence Wong and I held was at the Tuas View Dormitory, after we inspected their quarantine facilities in early February, she said.Wong helms the National Development Ministry and co-chairs the Multi-Ministry Taskforce tackling the spread of the virus.Teo added, We produced materials in the workers native languages to encourage them to take steps to protect themselves. Subsequently, non-essential facilities in the dormitories like gyms and TV rooms were closed. Meal-times and recreational hours were staggered. Intermixing between blocks was stopped.MOM officers also fanned out on weekends, to advise migrant workers to observe safe distancing measures and disperse big groups that were gathering at popular hangouts.Narrow focus on rooming arrangements may not prevent recurrenceIn February, the authorities detected the first COVID-19 cluster involving migrant workers at a construction site at Seletar Aerospace Heights. The five workers stayed at five different locations, only two of which were dormitories, Teo noted.Thereafter, there was no indication of higher prevalence of COVID-19 among migrant workers, compared to the general community, she said.Several MPs had raised queries on the outbreak of COVID-19 in dormitories. Jurong GRC MP Ang Wei Neng asked, among other things, about the lessons to be drawn from the management of dormitories and if safe distancing can be practically practised in the existing purpose-built dormitories.Meanwhile, Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng asked if MOM would consider raising the minimum gross floor area of 4.5 square metres for each resident in a foreign workers' dormitory; and not including the basic living facilities - such as living quarters, kitchen, dining, and toilet areas - in the computation for the minimum gross floor area.Nominated MPs Walter Theseira and Anthea Ong also asked if a Committee of Inquiry would be appointed to probe the COVID-19 outbreak in the dormitories.Responding, Teo said epidemiological findings show that within the dormitories which have clusters, not all blocks or rooms are equally affected. And across the different dormitories, infected workers were linked via common work sites.At the work sites, it was not uncommon for the infected workers to take breaks together, share food and utensils. Likewise, infected workers from different dormitories had gathered during their rest days to socialise and shop, for example at Mustafa. Back in the dormitories, workers spent time with their friends, cooking, eating and relaxing together, said Teo.The virus may have spread through all of these activities, much like how it spread among family members, religious groups and even colleagues, she added.Teo also noted that most infected workers showed mild symptoms of the virus and that many cases were uncovered only due to active case-finding or swab-taking.This may explain why up to the middle of March, the cases of workers at the dormitories testing positive were few and far between. Once evidence emerged that the virus had spread in the dormitories, we decided to deal with it squarely and quickly, and mobilise whole-of-government resources, the minister said.She added, Multiple channels of transmission among migrant workers, as appear to be the case, also means that we need a multi-faceted approach to dealing with the outbreak. A narrow focus on rooming arrangements may not prevent a recurrence. This consideration underpins the comprehensive approach of the Taskforce.-19-m...083406682.htmltrying to douse the fire with oil  They should jsut admit they imposed the social distancing measures to late lah.",2020-04-05 17:50:00,hardwarezone,singapore authorities sight early outbreak singapore start year said manpower minister josephine teo monday 4 may delivering ministerial statement parliament explained ministry manpower mom helped prevent imported limiting return work pass holders monitoring returnees compliance leaves absence stay home notices among things throughout period also radar said teo back january soon multi ministry task force set mom reached operators vigilant step hygiene fact one earliest media conferences minister lawrence wong held tuas view inspected quarantine facilities early february said wong helms national development ministry co chairs multi ministry taskforce tackling spread teo added produced materials native languages encourage take steps protect subsequently non essential facilities like gyms tv rooms closed meal times recreational hours staggered intermixing blocks stopped mom officers also fanned weekends advise observe safe distancing measures disperse big groups gathering popular hangouts narrow focus rooming arrangements may not prevent recurrence february authorities detected first cluster involving construction site seletar aerospace heights five stayed five different locations two teo noted thereafter no indication higher prevalence among compared general community said several mps raised queries outbreak jurong grc mp ang wei neng asked among things lessons drawn management safe distancing practically practised existing purpose built meanwhile nee soon grc mp louis ng asked mom would consider raising minimum gross floor area 4 5 square metres resident not including basic living facilities living quarters kitchen dining toilet areas computation minimum gross floor area nominated mps walter theseira anthea ong also asked committee inquiry would appointed probe outbreak responding teo said epidemiological findings show within clusters not blocks rooms equally affected across different infected linked via common work sites work sites not uncommon infected take breaks together share food utensils likewise infected different gathered rest days socialise shop example mustafa back spent time friends cooking eating relaxing together said teo may spread activities much like spread among family members religious groups even colleagues added teo also noted infected showed mild symptoms many uncovered due active case finding swab taking may explain middle march testing positive far evidence emerged spread decided deal squarely quickly mobilise whole government resources minister said added multiple channels transmission among appear case also means need multi faceted approach dealing outbreak narrow focus rooming arrangements may not prevent recurrence consideration underpins comprehensive approach taskforce 083406682 htmltrying douse fire oil should jsut admit imposed social distancing measures late

"> # Record 287 new Covid-19 cases in S'pore, links found between Mustafa Centre and clusters in foreign worker dormitories

> SINGAPORE - Singapore saw a sharp spike of 287 coronavirus cases on Thursday (April 9), with the majority linked to foreign worker dormitories.

> This is the highest daily number reported to date and brings the total number of cases here to 1,910, as the global number of cases crossed the 1.5 million mark.

> Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean is now advising the multi-ministry taskforce on handling the Covid-19 situation in foreign worker dormitories, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, noting that the police and Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) are involved in operations there.

> To cut the chain of transmission in dormitories, thousands of foreign workers who are healthy - especially those working in essential services - will be moved to army camps, floating hotels, and vacant Housing Board blocks.

> Singapore has also started active case finding and is swab-testing workers in various dormitories, said the Health Ministry's (MOH) director of medical services Kenneth Mak at a press conference on Thursday.

> Preliminary investigations have linked the cluster at Mustafa Centre with clusters at the construction site at Project Glory and five dormitories.

> Associate Professor Mak said the ministry believes that foreign workers had visited Mustafa Centre, where some employees had fallen ill, and gotten infected there.

> They then transmitted the infection to their co-workers, who subsequently infected others at their dormitories.

> ""Many had very mild symptoms and so they continued to work, that's why there was a delay in picking them up,"" said Mr Wong, who chairs the ministerial task force along with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong. It is likely that the virus had been spreading in dormitories for some time, he said.

>

> 

> Mr Wong said Singapore is dealing with two separate infection spreads.

> In foreign worker dormitories, numbers are rising sharply, he noted. But in the wider community, numbers are more stable.

> Related Story Coronavirus: Sungei Tengah Lodge is 4th foreign worker dorm gazetted as isolation area

> ""This is a major and urgent issue that requires active intervention,"" he said. ""That is why we decided to put in more resources and set up a dedicated task force focusing on dorms.""

> On Tuesday, the Manpower Ministry (MOM) had announced the formation of an inter-agency task force to provide support to foreign workers and dormitory operators.

> The task force will ensure the well-being of workers and improve their living conditions by supporting dormitory operators as they implement ""circuit-breaker"" measures.

> MOM is supported by the Ministry of Health, National Environment Agency, the SAF, the Singapore Police Force, Migrant Workers' Centre and other agencies.

> Explaining the Government's decision to set up a task force, Mr Wong said: ""We cannot rely solely on dorm operators any more, given the current situation.""

> Manpower Minister Josephine Teo noted that there has been no cluster in dormitories until recently, even though a number of foreign workers have tested positive for the virus.

> ""Bear in mind that dorms are home to foreign workers,"" she added. ""Within dorms workers interact with each other very regularly, very closely, they're like family, so the risk of transmission was always there.""

> Workers will now not be able to prepare their own meals, to reduce human contact, and cleanliness and hygiene have been stepped up. Existing sick bays will also be scaled up to take care of workers that need to be isolated.

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that despite circuit breaker measures kicking in on Tuesday, social gatherings are still taking place. More than 10,000 written advisories have been issued over the past two days to those who did not observe safe distancing.

> ""This cannot continue,"" he said.

> Mr Wong added that enforcement efforts will be stepped up against those who continue to flout safe-distancing measures.

> ""We hope Singaporeans will comply not just because of enforcement efforts but really out of a necessity for all of us to do our part,"" he said.

"-wo...gy-jo-teo/When asked in Parliament on Monday (May 4) whether the government will consider issuing an apology to migrant workers in Singapore on the Covid-19 outbreak in dormitories, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said that none of the workers she interacted with have demanded an apology.Teo said that based on interactions and feedback she received from migrant workers, they instead ask about the present situation, how not to fall sick, and if they do, how to ensure their wages are paid.Singapore's migrant worker community has come under focus during the Covid-19 outbreak, with 90 per cent of the country's 18,205 cases concentrated amongst work permit holders.eo was responding to a question posed by Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) Anthea Ong:""Will the government consider issuing an apology to the migrant workers, given the dismal conditions that they are currently in, because the conditions of the dormitories and all the other conditions? Especially now that they're in complete lockdown, for the sake and safety of Singaporeans.""Responding to Ong, Teo replied that she had not come across any migrant workers asking for an apology:""Ms. Anthea Ong asked about an apology. We interact very closely with the workers themselves, on a very regular basis at the dormitories, and even outside the dormitories whenever I'll ask teams, you know, follow up on their requests and feedback.I think what they’re focused on is how we can help them to handle this present situation, not fall sick, and if they fall sick, help take care of them, how to look after their wages being paid, how to ensure that they can send money home.These are the things that they have asked of us. I have not come across one single migrant worker himself that has demanded an apology.""This Ah Ong is real goondu. What about the local community got infected?

"> # COVID-19: Singapore confirms 344 new cases, with seven community cases

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 344 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Saturday (6 June) noon, bringing the total to 37,527.

> Of them, the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories, said the ministry, while seven others are classified as cases in the community.

> “Based on our investigations so far, there are seven cases in the community, of whom three are Singaporeans/permanent residents and four are work pass holders,” it added.

> The ministry added that more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of over 2,700 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Jurong Penjuru Dormitory, and Tuas View Dormitory.

> The four are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some 400,000 such workers live in dorms here in Singapore.

> National Development Minister and co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce Lawrence Wong had at a 12 May press conference said that some 20,000 infected foreign workers are expected to be discharged by end-May.

> This story will be updated later.

> With 305 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, a total of 24,209 – over 60 per cent of total cases here – here have fully recovered from the infection, said the MOH on Friday.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while four are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Over 12,000 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 24 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, nine others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and two whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> As of 1 June, the ministry has conducted 408,495 swab tests, of which 264,393 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 71,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 46,400 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

> The MOH has been publishing a list of locations visited by cases in the community for over 30 minutes since last Monday.

> This list – which excludes residences, workplaces, healthcare facilities, and public transport – will be updated on a rolling 14-day basis or one incubation period, the ministry said.

> As a precautionary measure, the MOH advised those who had been at these locations during the specified timings to monitor their health closely for 14 days from their date of visit.

> They have also been urged by the ministry to visit the doctor if they develop symptoms such as cough, sore throat, as well as fever and loss of taste or smell, and inform the doctor of their exposure history.

"> # Forum: Why foot the bill for dorm operators that have profited for years?

> Singaporeans have now learnt that operating mega dormitories for foreign workers is not a bad business at all (Rethink mega dorms beyond Covid-19 outbreak, May 14). For example, for the 2019 financial year, the net profits of Singapore Exchange-listed companies Centurion Corp, Wee Hur Holdings and Lian Beng Group from their dormitory and other businesses were $103.8 million, $34.9 million and $32.9 million, respectively.

> Singaporeans must therefore be puzzled as to why taxpayers will now be footing the bill for the increased operating costs incurred by such operators due to the dormitory lockdowns and stay-home notices (Govt to absorb added costs for dorm operators during circuit breaker, May 12).

> At a time when many deserving demands are competing for tight public finances, those who have profited for years from business models that have now come home to roost must not expect taxpayers to clean up after them.

">I said even if we took action earlier, the Dormitory spread will still happen because guess where those people are going to be locked down if we started it earlier.

Isn't this a convoluted reasoning? You are looking at it specifically from a time frame whereby it augments your statement.

ie There is community spread. The community spread has ALREADY reach the dormitory. Therefore an earlier lockdown, regardless, will still spread among the dormitory resulting in huge case numbers because of the conditions. Basically the only way for your statement to be true, you need a first spark to start the fire.

However, when ppl are talking about earlier lockdown, ppl meant it as a whole, to even prevent community spread(dormitory being an ideal hotspot does not equate to the virus will travel there by themselves) . Unless you are suggesting that an earlier lockdown WILL still result in spread because erm... magic? Because Taiwan definitely manage to prevent community spread by acting earlier.

"Wife of grassroots leader in workers dorm business, shows their Sentosa weekend party home to mediaIt was earlier reported that as of Wed (8 Apr) this week, active COVID-19 clusters have been found at 9 different foreign worker dormitories in Singapore.A few of the 9 are operated by companies linked to grassroots leaders of Peoples Association (PA). The top 2 foreign worker dormitories with the most number of confirmed COVID-19 cases as of yesterday (10 Apr) were S11 Dormitory (306 cases) and Westlite Toh Guan (69 cases). Both have been gazetted by the government as isolation areas under the Infectious Diseases Act.In particular, Westlite Toh Guan is run by public listed company Centurion Corporation Ltd, helmed by two PA grassroots leaders who are joint chairmen of the company: David Loh Kim Kang and Han Seng Juan. Han was awarded PBM in 2010 and BBM in 2015, while Loh got his PBM in 2011 and BBM in 2016.They were both given public service medals for helping out at Potong Pasir SMC under MP Sitoh Yih Pin. In the general election of 2011, PAP managed to wrestle back Potong Pasir from opposition and its now under PAP.Another board member of Centurion Corporation, Rajah & Tanns lawyer Chandra Mohan, is also a grassroots leader awarded with PBM and BBM in recognition of his contribution towards community services in Northwest Community Development Council (NWCDC).Hans Sentosa Cove weekend party home has rooms inspired by four seasonsFurther checks online revealed that socialite Susanna Kang is married to Han. In fact, 4 years ago, Mrs Han opened up their weekend party home at Sentosa Cove for reporters to take a look (Chic abodes: Two stylish women open up their homes).Mrs Han is said to be a fixture in society magazines, often seen wearing head-turning gowns and ensembles, complete with elaborate hairstyles.At the Hans Sentosa Cove weekend home, the ST reporter noted the creative streak in its design. Standing on a 9,000 sq ft plot of land, the expansive house is a weekend home and features rooms inspired by the four seasons, the reporter wrote. It is here that the family entertain friends and host dinners for close business partners about once a month, with as many as 100 people gathering at what has come to be known as the Party House.Apparently, Mrs Han wanted a house that has the wow factor for the purpose of entertaining guests. It was built in 2012. A curtain weighing more than 2,721kg imported from Germany and made of high-grade stainless steel cloaks the perimeter of the second floor. It can be pulled back to get an unblocked beautiful view of the sea.When guests arrive at the four-storey house, they descend a long flight of stairs into a cavernous basement. Mrs Han said, I meant for it to be like a runway, where guests can sashay and strut their stuff down the stairs. Its also the perfect spot to see the rest of the house. As you look up from the stairs, you get a good look at what else there is to explore.The basement is filled with futuristic-looking furniture from well-known brands and designers such as Italian label Moroso and renowned architect Zaha Hadid. An Hermes screen, made of a wood frame and scraps of crocodile skin taken from the cutting-room floor at the French luxury houses atelier, adds a luxurious touch. A luscious green wall, filled with creepers growing under ultraviolet light, is encased behind a misty glass screen, creating a tropical spring feel for the basement. Adding to that wild factor are two taxidermied peacocks that preen regally next to the bar.The dining room has a 22-seat custom-made table with bronzed legs and a high-gloss finish  the result of multiple layers of lacquer. It beautifully reflects American industrial designer Karim Rashids topograph-shaped chandelier that was made as part of Swarovskis Crystal Palace collection.The upper floors were designed for smaller break-out groups for relaxation especially after a nice dinner. On second level there are 3 rooms: One is a karaoke and media room, complete with decor of KTV lounges for the feel of the real thing, said Mrs Han. Another has a masculine vibe with a dark brown sofa by Italian furniture-maker Poltrona Frau and a well-stocked wine chiller. Here, the men can kick back and relax with cigars, while talking business, politics or any other matters. The third room simulates a chic ski resort cabin. Mrs Han has the air-conditioning ducts trained on this area so that the blast of cold air creates that icy feeling. The floor is covered in a fluffy, white carpet and there is a fireplace that runs on ethanol. It produces flames, but not heat.For parties around the pool, guests head to the summer room in the attic that is designed to look like a ships cabin. Sofa beds face the infinity pool outside. For movie nights, a hidden projector comes down and guests can kick back or sleep over if they want to and wake up to a sea view. I get my respite here. Its quite peaceful looking at the blue, open sea, she said.She described her Sentosa home as a modern kelong as it is surrounded by water but the family does not live there. Their family home is a good-class bungalow in Bukit Timah.(Pictures of the Hans Sentosa Cove weekend home from ST Photo):Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) warns about crammed condition in foreign worker dormitoriesMeanwhile, non-profit organization Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) has been warning about the crammed conditions in foreign worker dormitories being highly conducive to spread the coronavirus (Forum: Employers practices leave foreign workers vulnerable to infection, 23 Mar).Writing to ST Forum on 23 Mar, TWC2 said, Currently, foreign workers are housed 12 to 20 men per room in double-decker beds. They are transported to work on the back of lorries sitting shoulder to shoulder. Neither of these conditions conforms with social distancing. The risk of a new cluster among this group remains undeniable,TWC2 warned and advocated that new dormitory should require more space per head and no more than four persons to a room.On TWC2 website, it shows a picture of how crammed the condition is at a dormitory (Westlite Mandai) run by Hans company.Indeed, about a week later after TWC2 wrote to ST to warn everyone, clusters of COVID-19 started breaking out in different foreign worker dormitories.Perhaps Han should ask his wife to use her creative streak to also help design the Centurions foreign worker dormitories so that the workers can have less crammed spaces to live in?

"Singapore is looking ahead to a “recovery phase” for foreign workers currently isolated in dormitories to allow them to resume working safely, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said on Sunday (May 10).These workers, some of whom have recovered from Covid-19, will be able to return to work as various businesses eventually resume operations. This involves getting the workers tested to ensure they have properly recovered, and to continue monitoring their health, she said.The new system will involve the distribution of medical technology — including 20,000 pulse oximeters — to worker dormitories and other places they reside in, Mrs Teo added. A pulse oximeter gives an early warning of deteriorating health by measuring the level of oxygen in the blood.Conducting tele-medical consultations will also be used for foreign workers using tele-kiosks at dormitories or via mobile phones. Since April 25, about 400 consultations between doctors and foreign workers have taken place via phones, the Ministry of Manpower stated in a media release on Sunday.“The whole point of the recovery is aligned with our approach to eventually allow more activities in the economy to resume,” said Mrs Teo, who spoke to reporters after attending the unveiling of a new Covid-19 medical facility at the JTC Space @ Tuas, catering to foreign workers who do not reside in purpose-built dormitories.The vast majority of new Covid-19 cases in Singapore in recent weeks have been among foreign workers housed in dormitories.Mrs Teo said: “We are very mindful that from the worker standpoint, ultimately they are here in Singapore to work. And then from their employers' standpoint, workers are here to support their business. The main objective of this recovery phase is how to enable this to happen in a safe way.”She said to achieve this, changes in where the foreign workers live and where they work have to be made.Mrs Teo added that the ministry is now planning a “whole stream of activities” in order to bring about safe living, as well as safe working for these workers, noting that the virus spreads quickly due to communal living, even if hygiene levels are high.“By safe living and safe working, what we will also enable is for the businesses to continue in a safe way,” she said.Mrs Teo said the overall operation is “a fairly large piece of work” and that a technical media briefing would be held later to provide further details.A very important aspect of this recovery phase will be focused on how to strengthen health monitoring and surveillance in dormitories, she said. The ministry is, therefore, looking to use technology to enable more effective medical monitoring.“We are introducing new measures that will help us to look after the health conditions, and to do the health surveillance of our foreign workers in a more comprehensive way,” she said.“And we hope that by doing so, we will be able to help the individual worker prevent the recurrence if he has already been infected, or for those who have not been infected to prevent them from falling sick in the first place,” said Mrs Teo.The*new Covid-19 medical facility, which will start operations on Monday, includes a medical post and a swab isolation facility with 150 cubicles for foreign workers to reside in. Of those, 120 will be for workers waiting for their results while the other 30 will be for those who have tested positive. Results usually come back within two to three days.The medical post is the fifth of its kind outside of those that are available in the 43 purpose-built dormitories. The swab isolation facility is the third of its kind.A worker will be transported to the medical facility by shuttle bus if he feels the onset of symptoms of acute respiratory infection. He will be assessed by a doctor at the medical post, who will then determine if the worker is required to take the swab test or not.USING TECHNOLOGYMrs Teo said that about 8,000 pulse oximeters had been issued, with another 12,000 to be given out progressively. The priority is to issue the small, easy-to-use devices to workers with Covid-19 displaying mild symptoms in order to see if their health deteriorates.“So, in all, we're looking at maybe about 20,000 pulse oximeters that will be made available to our foreign workers in the purpose-built dorms, factory-converted dorms as well as the construction temporary quarters.”Another technological innovation at the medical facility is a tele-kiosk machine which facilitates video consultations with doctors and is connected to devices that can monitor vital signs such as blood pressure, oxygen saturation and temperature.Workers who are awaiting their results can connect to a doctor through this machine as doctors are available at all times and medication will be delivered to the workers if necessary. Eight tele-kiosks have been installed in other dormitories.A teleconsultation service via personal mobile devices to provide care after hours has also been set up, enabling workers to contact doctors through WhatsApp video call. Medication will be delivered to the workers if necessary.“When the workers eventually return to work their work hours are not likely to be the same for each and every one of them,” Mrs Teo*said.“Some of the workers may return to the dormitory at a time where the medical outposts cannot remain open,*so we have to look at what are some of the more sustainable ways to continue to perform this health monitoring, which is a very important part of taking care of the foreign workers.”She added: “We want them to stay healthy. We want them to be able to continue to support their employer. In order to be able to do so, we must find ways to protect their health. And if there is any cluster that is forming, we need to have some way of detecting it so that we can act fast.”-covid-19",2020-10-05 22:55:00,hardwarezone,singapore looking ahead recovery phase currently isolated allow resume working safely manpower minister josephine teo said sunday may 10 recovered able return work various businesses eventually resume operations involves getting tested ensure properly recovered continue monitoring health said new system involve distribution medical technology including 20 000 pulse oximeters places reside mrs teo added pulse oximeter gives early warning deteriorating health measuring level oxygen blood conducting tele medical consultations also used using tele kiosks via mobile phones since april 25 400 consultations doctors taken place via phones ministry manpower stated media release sunday whole point recovery aligned approach eventually allow activities economy resume said mrs teo spoke reporters attending unveiling new medical facility jtc space tuas catering not reside purpose built vast majority new singapore recent weeks among housed mrs teo said mindful standpoint ultimately singapore work employers standpoint support business main objective recovery phase enable happen safe way said achieve changes live work made mrs teo added ministry planning whole stream activities order bring safe living well safe working noting spreads quickly due communal living even hygiene levels high safe living safe working also enable businesses continue safe way said mrs teo said overall operation fairly large piece work technical media briefing would held later provide details important aspect recovery phase focused strengthen health monitoring surveillance said ministry therefore looking use technology enable effective medical monitoring introducing new measures help us look health conditions health surveillance comprehensive way said hope able help individual prevent recurrence already infected not infected prevent falling sick first place said mrs teo new medical facility start operations monday includes medical post swab isolation facility 150 cubicles reside 120 waiting results 30 tested positive results usually come back within two three days medical post fifth kind outside available 43 purpose built swab isolation facility third kind transported medical facility shuttle bus feels onset symptoms acute respiratory infection assessed doctor medical post determine required take swab test not using technologymrs teo said 8 000 pulse oximeters issued another 12 000 given progressively priority issue small easy use devices displaying mild symptoms order see health deteriorates looking maybe 20 000 pulse oximeters made available purpose built factory converted well construction temporary quarters another technological innovation medical facility tele kiosk machine facilitates video consultations doctors connected devices monitor vital signs blood pressure oxygen saturation temperature awaiting results connect doctor machine doctors available times medication delivered necessary eight tele kiosks installed teleconsultation service via personal mobile devices provide care hours also set enabling contact doctors whatsapp video call medication delivered necessary eventually return work work hours not likely every one mrs teo said may return time medical outposts cannot remain open look sustainable ways continue perform health monitoring important part taking care added want stay healthy want able continue support employer order able must find ways protect health cluster forming need way detecting act fast

About taxpayers' money being spent to treat the foreign workers, I think it's still going to be much lesser than the subsequent social and economic costs if the government did NOT intervene.

The last few weeks have shown that, no amount of appeals to common good is working... people just don't give a shit. Those who've run the dorms have been doing this years, and there's very little chance of them changing their ways, and if at all they do, there's a question of whether they'll do it fast enough.

In a pandemic crisis where time is critical, government intervention is the only way, imho

You and your Ministers are earning an exorbitant amount of salary and failing miserably during this COVID19 pandemic crisis. Your worth should be evident, not during the good times but times like this adverse condition. It's fine if you and your government had erred but at least be accountable and apologetic, instead of going on your defence to give excuses. This is not the first time. Each and every time you have messed it up, it's always going on the defence with excuses. Never apologetic with reasons. It's fine to be wrong. No one is perfect. For at least once be bold enough to be accountable, apologetic and be outright about your next course of action. It's so easy for you and your government to point fingers at the opposition but get offended when fingers are pointed at you and be revengeful.

"So, I guess you approve of the govt passing the buck to the WHO, right?

Many of us here were clamoring for a lockdown, especially flights from China at the time, but this Tedros character was reticent about declaring the situation in Wuhan as a PHEIC, allowing them to escape to the various countries. A govt should NOT be sheep that's herded by a bad shepherd (WHO) when it's gambling with its citizens' lives.

"The Republic has been aggressively testing foreign workers for the coronavirus, even those who are well and have no symptoms, the multi-ministry task force told a press conference on Tuesday (April 21).Authorities have refrained from testing every single person in the larger community because of their sheer number, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, who co-chairs the task force.Singapore has a ""very strategic way"" of conducting tests, he explained.He said: ""We have millions of Singaporeans, and we will not be able to test every one of them. So... we do targeted testing.""For instance, tests are done on essential workers who need to go out to ensure that they are not carrying the infection while going to work.A random testing programme, known as sentinel surveillance, is also used to pick up cases in the community that would otherwise have gone undetected.This programme is aimed at finding people who have the virus, but have very mild symptoms or do not meet criteria that will make them a suspect case.Such testing has revealed that there are still cases of Covid-19 being transmitted in the community, some of whom remain infectious despite mild symptoms, said Mr Gan.""That is why we need to put in extra effort (with) these circuit breaker measures, to make sure that we are able to bring down these community cases, particularly those that are unlinked,"" he said.The Health Ministry's Director of Medical Services, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, said that although the number of tests conducted varied on a daily basis, it could rise to between 2,800 and 3,000 on some days.Between 1,500 and 2,500 of these tests were being carried out on foreign workers.Mr Gan explained that testing helped to give a sense of the prevalence of Covid-19 in the dormitories, allowing the authorities to identify those where the disease is more widespread, and determine the level of response.It also enables those in charge to identify infected patients and get them the necessary medical attention.Noting that over 5,000 foreign workers had already tested positive for the virus, Assoc Prof Mak said: ""We've in fact (tested) more than that, because there's also those (that) tested negative as well. So the number continues to grow.""But Singapore is prepared for the increased pace of testing. Earlier on Tuesday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in an address to the nation, said that in addition to developing and manufacturing its own test kits Singapore was also getting them from overseas.Mr Gan explained during the press conference that this was intended to help keep testing options open here.""We want to be able to also use different models, different test kits, different ways of testing,"" he said.He added that the purchase of test kits from overseas was also intended to help Singapore increase its testing capacity and capabilities, in order to prepare for the eventual lifting of circuit breaker measures.""Our testing is not just for now... as we progress in opening up our circuit breaker measures, we will need to increase our testing capability because we need to make sure that there is no transmission in the community - and in order to make sure that there's no transmission in the community, we need to test a lot more,"" he said.-on-foreign",2020-04-21 22:27:00,hardwarezone,republic aggressively testing even well no symptoms multi ministry task force told press conference tuesday april 21 authorities refrained testing every single person larger community sheer number said health minister gan kim yong co chairs task force singapore strategic way conducting tests explained said millions singaporeans not able test every one targeted testing instance tests done essential need go ensure not carrying infection going work random testing programme known sentinel surveillance also used pick community would otherwise gone undetected programme aimed finding people mild symptoms not meet criteria make suspect case testing revealed still transmitted community remain infectious despite mild symptoms said mr gan need put extra effort circuit breaker measures make sure able bring community particularly unlinked said health ministry director medical services associate professor kenneth mak said although number tests conducted varied daily basis could rise 2 800 3 000 days 1 500 2 500 tests carried mr gan explained testing helped give sense prevalence allowing authorities identify disease widespread determine level response also enables charge identify infected patients get necessary medical attention noting 5 000 already tested positive assoc prof mak said fact tested also tested negative well number continues grow singapore prepared increased pace testing earlier tuesday prime minister lee hsien loong address nation said addition developing manufacturing test kits singapore also getting overseas mr gan explained press conference intended help keep testing options open want able also use different models different test kits different ways testing said added purchase test kits overseas also intended help singapore increase testing capacity capabilities order prepare eventual lifting circuit breaker measures testing not progress opening circuit breaker measures need increase testing capability need make sure no transmission community order make sure no transmission community need test lot said

"I'm not claiming that the SG govt is incompetent (though my poorly-worded comments may suggest otherwise). If anything, I doubt I am in a position to call them incompetent :P

In comparison to other countries, I do feel that SG has handled the situation relatively well, though comparing SG to other countries does open up a whole new can of worms. We shouldn't fault the govt for mismanagement due to wrong timing, lack of information, etc., either. And yes, hindsight bias does cloud our judgement. But I do feel that there are valid criticisms on the lack of infrastructure (medical facilities for quarantine) as well as miscommunications and mismanagement of expectations, and I'm sure you know this as well.

"Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) is a non-profit organisation in Singapore dedicated to improving conditions for low-wage migrant workers.

I think they give a very fair and balanced view on the situation and how it came to be. There are some bad employers out there but a lot of the blame also fails with the failure in government regulation/enforcement.

It is this failure that allows these few bad actors to get away with this mistreatment, hence the 'good' employers end up with a more expensive cost base and eventually get outcompeted on projects/contracts. These good employers either lose out or adapt their worker policies in order to survive and the vicious cycle continues.

"Herd immunity is not a good idea.

UK death rate has gone past 20k and is expected to be the worst hit 'European' country.  The British government's plan for tackling the epidemic has been largely informed by a study from the Imperial College London, which said that a lockdown and social distancing measures would -- hopefully -- limit the number of deaths to between 20,000 and 30,000.  This is a mind boggling figure.

And this piece from a US epidemiologist says it all about why herd immunity is a disaster.

"For a short term solution, yes you are right. However it would become another cycle hidden away from us in the future when the foreign workers and their living conditions becomes forgotten and the companies decide to start exploiting loopholes in the systems.

Collectively I still feel such situations could have been overall avoided if not for the fact that singaporeans have become an entitled nation. The hard truth is that no one would do their work for the meagre salary. Theres also the hard labour that is not enticing under the hot sun or stifled conditions within construction. We should have been learning from examples like Australia, where they pay their labour workers well and a huge bulk of the hard labour jobs consists of their own people. This also creates a sense of pride within our community.

Going back to the main point, if we as a nation has been in such a situation where we dont rely on foreign workforce, the housing situation might not have happened and any form of exploitation would have been greatly reduced which in turns lead up to the fact that when a pandemic occurs, which is does throughout history, such a scenario we see unfolding would not have occurred.

The foreign workers and their contributions have been immense to our nation building.

"The reason why it seems the burden is placed on you by me (and many others like me) is because you are the one making the claim that the current level of government attention toward the dorm problem is disproportionately high. I (and apparently, many others like me)  recognise the importance of tackling the dorm problem, and maintaining the same level of attention, effort, and expenditure of resources.

Quibbling over individual policies (and demanding for new alternatives that even the government hasn't figured out yet) is besides the point. The genesis of the argument is that you think government is placing too much emphasis on the dorm problem. I have told you why that is not the case - because the dorm problem IS the Singapore covid problem. 

Your comments seems to suggest the current measures taken on the dorm problem are considered ""enough"" - have they been?The cases have increased exponentially. The first isolation areas were gazetted on April 5, 18 days ago. Given the suspected incubation period is 14 days, does it seem like they are ""enough"" to contain the spread? I personally do not feel so.

Let me note here that I do not blame the government. I believe that they are, in good faith, doing their job to the best of their ability. I am merely positing that they should continue undertaking all that is necessary to curb the dorm problem. You are the one suggesting they should do less.

An example could be medical proof from the Singapore General Hospital, suggested the 82-year-old retiree.“I’m not saying they have the disease.

"Again, this is capitalism. If  the govt is doing the work in coming up with ideas and solutions to keep construction companies profitable, then is it really capitalism? Might as well keep the profits for ourselves then. The solution on our end is just set the minimum requirements, then let the market decide for themselves how they want to work things out. Its the same with other forms of regulations we have. Take the example of internet banking that is happening right now. Govt sets the minimum requirements and the private sector competes with each other for the license and figures it out for themselves how to get it done. We dont have to go into detail to tell them how to do it. You want government to provide them with programmers and coders and customer support staff? No. You set the floor, and let the companies do the work. That's the point of capitalism.

And if it ends up making things harder for the FW, then we adjust and try again. Policy is always open-ended in that sense.

Edit: Speaking of economics, the pertinent problem here is that  these companies are causing a negative externality in the form of higher spread of disease.

"Weighing Singapore's response to the Covid-19 pandemicDid Singapore overlook Covid-19 cases in foreign worker dormitories; give wrong advice on mask-wearing; and is it too lax in its circuit breaker measures?-19-pandemicThe plaudits had come early for Singapore in its fight against the coronavirus.Around the world, epidemiologists and media reports held the country up as a model to emulate for bringing the outbreak under control with a strategy of aggressive testing, meticulous contact tracing and strict isolation.Yet, from being hailed by some as the ""gold standard"" in tackling the virus, the Republic is now referred to by others as a ""cautionary tale"" of how potent the coronavirus is as well as the risks of easing up on measures to contain it.This has led some to question the approach taken in recent weeks: Did the Government overlook the situation in the dormitories? Should mask-wearing have been mandated from the start? Could an earlier and stricter lockdown have prevented the current situation?Often, this is done with 20/20 hindsight. But with what is known about the virus being debunked week to week and the situation evolving daily, it is normal for people to feel uncertain and wonder if the authorities have got it right.BLINDSIDED BY BUGThe most pressing situation now is the one playing out in the purpose-built mega dormitories and factory-converted dorms housing over 320,000 of the 720,000 foreign work permit holders (excluding foreign domestic workers).An explosive growth in Covid-19 cases in these compounds has led to 19 of them being declared isolation zones as of Monday, while all other purpose-built accommodations housing foreign workers have been placed under partial lockdowns.Yesterday alone, close to 1,100 cases were recorded among foreign workers, and health experts warn that if the spread is not curtailed fast, deaths will almost be certain, and hospitals will be overstretched.Could this disaster have been prevented? Some critics believe so.The workers sleep 12 to 20 to a room, with even larger numbers sharing facilities like bathrooms and kitchens, and migrant worker groups have lobbied for better living conditions for years.On March 23, Transient Workers Count Too, or TWC2, had warned of a cluster possibly breaking out, given that the workers live in such close quarters that it is impossible to practise safe distancing.The non-governmental group had alluded to how this could be averted - it would require the rehousing of hundreds of thousands of workers. But it acknowledged that it is unrealistic for additional dormitories to be built in mere weeks or months.With attention at the time focused elsewhere, especially with the flurry of Singaporeans returning home from abroad having to be kept apart from the rest of the population to prevent the spread of the virus, it is doubtful that the public would have appreciated the need to peremptorily expend huge resources to rehouse workers from dormitories at the time.Yet, in the recent weeks alone, thousands of workers have had to be moved out of dormitories and into alternative housing at military camps, floating hotels and vacant Housing Board blocks, with more areas such as sports facilities and hotels set to be converted for such use.So inevitably the question has arisen of whether it could have been done before the super spreading event at Mustafa Centre seeded the infections in the dormitories.Several factors may have informed the decision to manage outbreaks as they happen, say experts.The first Covid-19 cases involving foreign workers in February had been successfully contained, and never ""exploded into big clusters"", in the words of Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry coronavirus task force.Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said this suggests that responses put in place such as testing, contact tracing and isolating cases were adequate.Also, precautions were already being taken at the compounds, with temperature checks, increased cleaning of shared spaces, and hand sanitisers for workers to use.Prof Teo said the current crisis at the dormitories was the result of what epidemiologists call a super spreading event that is difficult to predict.""This is what we mean by a very unfortunate event that, in hindsight, people will say we should have known,"" he added.Such events have driven epidemics and once they happen, it is crucial to quickly recognise and understand them to arrest the spread.On this count, Nanyang Technological University's Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine visiting professor Annelies Wilder-Smith believes the Government is on the right track in thinning out the dorms. But she warned that it is now a race against time and the infection could ""spread like a fire, and Singapore has to move faster than the speed of the virus"".At the same time, gazetting the worst-hit dorms as isolation areas is necessary to keep the infection from spilling over into the general population.Prof Teo cautioned that this should not be misconstrued as ""discrimination"", adding that such a classical public health response was also employed in Hong Kong during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic, when an entire apartment block had to be closed off.As long as workers are also being cared for and protected in the dorms, this is probably the best way to control the dormitory outbreak, said Professor Wilder-Smith.Both experts said that a lesson to take away from this is that the spread of Covid-19 can quickly go out of control in situations where people live side by side, not just in dormitories, but also in old folks' homes.TO MASK OR NOT?Another issue that is hotly debated now is whether the Government was wrong to urge people not to wear masks in the initial phase of the outbreak.Then, ministers had discouraged people from using masks, citing advice from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other experts on the Sars-CoV-2 virus being spread through droplets and not aerosols.Officials also noted that in the light of a global shortage, it was best to conserve the use of such protective gear to ensure that it is available to medical professionals when they need it to care for patients.As more became known about the disease, the Government has in the past weeks changed its stance, distributing reusable masks to everyone and mandating the wearing of masks in public. While the WHO has maintained that healthy people do not need to wear masks, officials have acknowledged that it may become common practice.Some have called it a flip-flop.Others have attributed the rise in cases in Singapore to people not wearing masks, pointing to how in places like Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, where the practice is commonplace, the numbers of infections have been kept low.But experts point out that these regions have also espoused other key public health responses to the pandemic such as rigorous testing, comprehensive contact tracing and strict isolationHas not wearing masks been detrimental here?Prof Teo said this is not borne out by the data on community transmission.Up until March 24, there had mostly been fewer than 10 cases of such transmissions a day, he said, adding that the numbers would have spiked by February had the limited use of masks been a big factor. With such small numbers of infected people roaming around in the community, the chances of people catching the disease when going about their daily life were also small, and there was thus no need for the widespread adoption of masks early on, he added.He likened the wearing of surgical masks in the early days to people wearing motorcycle helmets everywhere they go.""Does the helmet protect one from head injury? The answer is yes. But why does one not wear it to, say, FairPrice to shop? Because we perceive our risk of getting a head injury from grocery shopping to be very low,"" he said.""Similarly, when there is very little transmission, wearing a face mask is similar to wearing a motorcycle helmet while buying groceries. We need to manage or perceive risk in an objective way.""With a shortage of N95 respirators and surgical masks worldwide, experts believe that every country's priority should be to maintain inventories of such protective equipment for doctors, nurses and first responders.If healthcare workers get infected or die in large numbers, healthcare systems will collapse, causing panic in society.Thus, encouraging the use of masks has to be balanced with the preservation of the limited resource. If three-quarters of the 5.6 million people here use just two surgical masks a day, Singapore will expend more than 58.8 million masks a week.Now, with scientists discovering that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infected people might unwittingly spread the virus, the advice on mask-wearing has changed, and people are encouraged to wear a reusable mask in public so as to protect others.Ironically, it has been an uphill task to get everyone to comply, and it has not been hard to spot people without masks in public.LAISSEZ-FAIRE LOCKDOWN?The third issue is whether an earlier and more complete lockdown would have helped Singapore avoid the current situation, where daily Covid-19 cases have breached the 1,000 mark.From the get-go, Singapore has taken a calibrated approach to managing the outbreak, with measures changing as the situation evolved.While testing, contact tracing and quarantining have been a constant, the Government has preferred a proportionate response in implementing safe distancing measures gradually, instead of having a more draconian total lockdown.For some, this calibrated approach, with rules changing on a daily basis, has seemed wishy-washy and confusing.If Singapore had taken a more cut and dried approach, imposed a police-enforced lockdown with curfews and stopped public transport as some countries have done, could it have eradicated the virus?Debate on this topic has intensified as lockdowns take their toll on economies and public life around the world, and countries contemplate the loosening of restrictions to allow some modicum of normal life to resume.Ironically, some commentators were citing Singapore as the model of what a less stringent lockdown might look like. With the surge in numbers now, Singapore is also pointed to as an example of the risks that premature easing up might entail, making it plain that no easy, one-size-fits-all solution exists for this very unusual outbreak.Prof Wilder-Smith believes that for some countries like Singapore and New Zealand, completely locking down is possible and can potentially bring infections to zero.But she added that this would include ringfencing the country from even its own citizens who are overseas and want to return.Also, such a total lockdown would have to be maintained for some time for infections to be kept out, as the world has missed the boat on containment and infections can easily be reintroduced once Singapore opens its borders.""Four weeks ago, I would say every country should go for containment. But worldwide, we have missed that chance,"" Prof Wilder-Smith said. ""If it's one or two weeks, we will all gladly do it. But we don't know how long this situation will last and a total lockdown can mean long-term suffering with very strict restrictions for months and months to come, which also causes major damage.""As for an earlier lockdown, Prof Teo said data in the early days did not justify it.A lockdown reduces physical interaction and helps to break chains of transmission. But with the number of cases spreading in the community in the double digits daily at most, a lockdown would have been akin to using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, bringing unneeded disruption to life when cases could have been controlled through strategies like contact tracing, testing and isolation.Elsewhere, in Wuhan, where the virus had first emerged, and in Italy, one of the worst-hit European countries so far, lockdowns substantially reduced the number of new cases for a time.But experts now agree that it is mostly a delaying tactic, and believe that cases will rebound when the restrictions are lifted.So far, lockdowns are estimated to cost a staggering total of US$7.8 trillion (S$11.2 trillion) worldwide. In Singapore, the economic toll of the current partial lockdown is predicted to be around $10 billion. As people work from home and children stay away from school, there have also been more reports of domestic abuse and mental health issues.After just 15 days of the circuit breaking period in Singapore, there are also signs of ""lockdown fatigue"", with people venturing out and crowding the only places where they are now allowed to visit such as supermarkets and parks.This is why governments around the world have struggled to find the right balance between imposing strict restrictions to resolve the pandemic and not causing irreversible harm to the economy and society.At the same time, for a calibrated approach to work, rules have to be kept simple. For now, caveats and exemptions for mask-wearing and enlisting the help of grandparents for childcare support, for instance, have caused confusion and led to non-compliance.LONG ROAD AHEADIn an interview with CNN on March 29, when asked about Singapore's success, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had cautioned against complacency, pointing to a long road ahead, as other ministers had also done. Indeed, several had said early on that the outbreak could last into 2021, raising some eyebrows at the time.""I hesitate to talk about success because we are right in the midst of a battle which is intensifying,"" said PM Lee. ""With great effort, I think it (Singapore's measures) has helped to keep the number of cases down, but I am under no illusions that we have won. We are just going in, and there is a long battle ahead.""His words have rung true and Singapore is in the news again, this time as a cautionary tale.Harvard University professor of epidemiology Marc Lipsitch, who had praised Singapore's approach in a research paper, said, when asked, that while Singapore has done admirably well in how long it was able to maintain a degree of control while keeping up significant economic activity, he never believed with certainty that the epidemic would be kept under control here.He told The Straits Times: ""But I see the failure of containment after a significant period of time as reflecting the strong challenges of this virus (even more than Sars, for example) rather than the failure of any specific location.""Prof Wilder-Smith said: ""So Singapore looked good three weeks ago and not so now... We should not be too early in making judgments and should maybe wait until the end to compare.""With scientists predicting that lockdowns might have to last until next year, and new information indicating that recovering from the infection may not confer immunity for long, governments will have to be careful about allowing hubris or complacency to set in while a vaccine is being developed.This is yet another fine balancing act.Prof Teo said: ""Definitely we should not be arrogant and we should not be mocking the efforts of other countries... Equally, it does not mean Singapore is arrogant or smug if we share our experiences with other countries.""In a crisis faced by the whole world, sharing those experiences becomes crucially important as a case study of what has worked and what hasn't.""",2020-04-22 10:23:00,hardwarezone,weighing singapore response pandemicdid singapore overlook give wrong advice mask wearing lax circuit breaker

"SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 287 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday (Apr 9), the largest daily increase so far and more than double yesterday's highest record, the multi-ministry task force dealing with the coronavirus said during a press conference on Thursday (Apr 9).This brings the national tally to 1,910.Of the new cases, 219 are linked to existing clusters, with at least 160 cases linked to the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol.A total of 19 cases are linked to previous cases, with 46 unlinked cases, the task force said. Three of the latest cases announced are imported. 314 cases have been discharged from acute care, and 705 cases have been moved to a community isolation facility, the task force said. Singapore has also seen six fatalities from COVID-19, the task force said. It was reported on Wednesday a 32-year-old Indian national died after taking a swab test, and was confirmed to have COVID-19 after his demise.READ: Day 2 of COVID-19 'circuit breaker' sees more than 3,000 breaches of safe distancing measuresThe task force said that with the help of the police and Ministry of Defence, it established a link between the  cluster at Mustafa Centre shopping mall and the Project Glory construction site as well as a number of foreign worker dormitories: S11 [email protected], Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tampines Dormitory Cochrane Lodge II  and Toh Guan Dormitory. Director of medical services at the Ministry of Health Assoc Prof Kenneth Mak described how some of the dormitory cases were linked to the Mustafa Centre cluster.""We believe that the workers had visited Mustafa and they subsequently transmitted the infection to their co-workers,"" he said.  ""Transmission most likely occurred through close contact,for example at meal times, during breaks, and also between co-workers at work due to physical proximity at work sites,"" he said.Subsequently, they could have spread the infection to colleagues and friends within the dormitories, he added. Singapore has seen a rise of COVID-19 cases at foreign worker domitories recently.Sungei Tengah Lodge became the fourth foreign worker dormitory to become an isolation area from midnight on Thursday, in a move aimed at preventing the spread of the disease.The other three dormitores that have been gazetted as isolation areas are: S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, Westlite Toh Guan dormitory and Toh Guan Dormitory.-12624378",2020-09-04 20:27:00,sgtalk,singapore singapore reported 287 new thursday apr 9 largest daily increase far double yesterday highest record multi ministry task force dealing said press conference thursday apr 9 brings national tally 1 910 new 219 linked existing clusters least 160 linked s11 punggol total linked previous 46 unlinked task force said three latest announced imported 314 discharged acute care 705 moved community isolation facility task force said singapore also seen six fatalities task force said reported wednesday year old indian national died taking swab test confirmed demise read day 2 circuit breaker sees 3 000 breaches safe distancing measuresthe task force said help police ministry defence established link cluster mustafa centre shopping mall project glory construction site well number s11 email protected sungei tengah lodge tampines cochrane lodge ii toh guan director medical services ministry health assoc prof kenneth mak described linked mustafa centre cluster believe visited mustafa subsequently transmitted infection co said transmission likely occurred close contact example meal times breaks also co work due physical proximity work sites said subsequently could spread infection colleagues friends within added singapore seen rise domitories recently sungei tengah lodge became fourth become isolation area midnight thursday move aimed preventing spread disease three dormitores gazetted isolation areas s11 punggol westlite toh guan toh guan 12624378

"1) how do you plan to avert the damage that your nativist policies will inflict on transnational families, ie. ""true blue"" singaporeans married to foreign spouses and ""true blue"" singaporean offspring of at least one foreign spouse? will singaporean spouses of prcs and indian nationals and filipinos + their singaporean kids not be disillusioned with their own country if one of their foreign parents constantly has to cop shit (""tiong"", ""cheena"", ""ceca"", ""pinoy"", ""foreign trash"") from the lowest common denominators because of the xenophobia that your manifesto will enable?

perhaps you should consider that hyper-neoliberal economic policies and the lack of proper worker protections in singapore are the real issues at hand - and that foreigners, despite being an easy target, are not responsible for the ills that we face?

2) how do you plan to renegotiate trade agreements with superpowers like china and india when singapore is a small fry with little manoeuvering room and a practically non-existent domestic market? how do you plan to account for the fact that FTA renegotiations are virtually unheard of? if the usa of all countries cannot renego the TPP, what sort of hubris are you filled with to genuinely believe that china and india will waste their time on a small fry like singapore and put our interests first over theirs?

they would sooner cancel the csfta and ceca and destroy our industries and small businesses in the process than give an inch.

I am attempting to tabulate the all local linked cases (including to imported cases) and those small clusters of 2 and 3s that are usually not reported explicitly in the daily press release.

My thoughts:

New cases would not be stabilized until

* the number of untraced cases from the reporting day drops to a low number, arbitrarily speaking 50 or less
* the number of untraced cases from the past few days (backlog) drops
* most of the cases involving work pass holders appear in 2 clusters, 1 for workplace, 1 for dorm

In a sense, due to circuit breaker, all work pass holder cases + their dorms + their workplaces are ""contained and monitored"" as 1 mega cluster.

"A forum letter published in Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao that links the COVID-19 outbreak in dormitories to the personal hygiene and living habits of foreign workers shows ""underlying racism"", Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said.""I think the letter reveals some underlying racism ... Because it typecasts an entire group - several hundred thousand of them - as lacking in personal hygiene, on the basis of their background, because they all come from backward countries,"" he said in an interview with Lianhe Zaobao on Friday (Apr 17).Mr Shanmugam also said that the letter is xenophobic and deeply insensitive, and reflected a ""lack of understanding of why we have this transmission of COVID-19 amongst our foreign worker population"".Singapore has seen a spike in its number of COVID-19 cases in recent weeks, with the majority of new cases involving foreign workers from dormitories.On Friday, Singapore reported 623 new infections, of which 558 were linked to foreign worker dormitories.Kranji Lodge 1 on Saturday became the 13th foreign worker dormitory to be gazetted an isolation area, meaning residents will have to be quarantined in their rooms.To date, more than 3,200 of Singapore's 5,050 cases are attributed to foreign worker domitories.The forum letter, published on Apr 13, questioned if foreign workers were to be blamed for the rise in cases, pointing to their eating habits and alleged lack of personal hygiene.Mr Shanmugam, however, said that the number of cases at foreign worker dormitories were primarily due to communal living, pointing out that foreign workers live, work and cook together.""Personal habits are extremely important  washing of hands, keeping yourself clean are very important,"" he said.""But when you put people together, when they sleep in the same room, they cook together and they are in close proximity over a long period of time, of course there will be high levels of transmission.""Mr Shanmugam also acknowledged concerns over the living conditions in dormitories, saying that conditions in the newer dormitories were ""quite okay"", while standards in the older ones varied.""As (Manpower) Minister Josephine Teo has said, look, we will fix this up after COVID-19, and we will deal with the older dorms,"" he said.With foreign worker cases expected to continue rising amid aggressive testing, Mr Shanmugam said there is a need to educate people on the reasons.""The circulation is limited, they are in community isolation,"" he said.""The cross-infection from that person to the rest of the community, whether Singaporean or PR, or foreign worker, is extremely minimised through our isolation approaches.""Some people have also expressed concern that foreign domestic workers, because of potential interaction with foreign workers on their days off, could be another group at risk of being infected in large numbers.Current data shows that infection among foreign domestic workers is very low, said Mr Shanmugam.Foreign domestic workers have to comply with circuit breaker measures and must remain in their employers' homes on their rest days.""The evidence so far is that they get the infection from their employers, not from outside,"" he added.Looking at the bigger picture, Mr Shanmugam said Singaporeans have a duty to care for foreign workers and show them empathy, adding that the Government and community have moved to help them.Fifty-seven per cent of Singaporeans have been able to become professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMET) because of foreign workers, he said.""They clean Singapore, they build our HDB flats, they build our buildings, they handle our waste management, they form the base of our economy,"" he added.""And therefore they are helping us build our prosperity.""Mr Shanmugam cautioned Singaporeans against making sweeping statements about foreign workers, even as he acknowledged that racial fault lines run deep.""As Singaporeans, I would say, whether Chinese, Indian or Malay, or Eurasians, others, we are really kind, compassionate, generous people,"" he stated.""We are bigger than the sentiments expressed in that letter.""-12654924huh?

"Math is important, but what are you implying here? That if we can't do the math, let's allow a bunch of poor/brown people to live in inhumane conditions, and maybe suffer and die?

Any business or government that cannot ensure humane conditions for all should fall. It's as simple as that. If it requires a period of a lowered standard of living which is still humane, then so be it.

Don't accidentally imply that some human beings should suffer and die while others live on comfortably. I'm afraid that would accidentally align you with the fascists of the world.

"> # COVID-19: Singapore confirms 876 new cases, total crosses 23,000

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed 876 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Sunday (10 May) noon, bringing the total to 23,336.

> Of the cases, 860 are foreign workers living in dormitories, said the ministry. There is one imported case and four cases in the local community.

> There are also five new clusters: a construction site at 15 Serangoon North Avenue 1, a construction site at Tanah Merah Coast Road, 9 Woodlands Industrial Park E1, 11 Woodlands Industrial Park E1 and 515 Yishun Industrial Park A.

> Also, the ministry said that it had recently found that 33 cases from a laboratory were false positives, “due to an apparatus calibration issue for one of its test kits”. This was discovered as a result of its regular reviews of laboratory tests.

> Subsequent retesting at the National Public Health Laboratory confirmed that these were negative cases. “There were no false negative results discovered from our review,” MOH said. “MOH has taken immediate actions to rectify the situation. The laboratory has stopped all tests and is working to resolve the calibration issue.”

> In addition, the ministry said, “There were two results that had been equivocal, and were subsequently verified to be negative upon re-testing.”

> It added that all equivocal results are sent to the National Public Health Laboratory for re-testing. “As a precautionary measure, we had categorised Cases 18669 and 19360 as positive while pending verification, and isolated them.”

> Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.

> This includes the five additional cases that are now linked to the cluster at Mustafa Centre (145 Syed Alwi Road), which has a total of 129 confirmed cases currently

> One additional case is linked to the cluster at Acacia Home (30 Admiralty Street), which has a total of 17 confirmed cases now.

> More than 50 clusters linked to foreign worker dormitories have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Tuas View Dormitory and Sungei Tengah Lodge.

> The three are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some 400,000 foreign workers live in dorms here in Singapore.

> 

> A total of 425 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 2,721 have fully recovered from the infection.

> There are currently 1,097 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, with 22 of them in critical condition in the intensive care unit. A total of 19,498 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19.

> Apart from 20 who have passed away due to COVID-19 complications, six patients who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including a 44-year-old Bangladeshi man who died of a heart attack on Tuesday.

> As of 4 May, the ministry has conducted 175,604 swab tests, of which 123,525 were done on unique individuals.

> This translates to about 30,800 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and around 21,600 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

"Why the PAP has failed14 Feb - there was a foreign worker tested positive for COVID-19 and he was rushed into ICU a day later. 17 Feb - 2 more foreign workers were tested positive for the virus. 18 Feb - it was revealed that they formed a new cluster from a work site.News came out and employers rushed to send their foreign workers, who are unwell, to the hospital for a swab test.19 Feb - MOM published a news article from Mr Kelvin Teoh (divisional director of MOM for foreign workers) that employers must not send the foreign workers to the hospital or they may have their WORK PASS privileges suspended. Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet. The poor foreign workers in numbers of 300,000 became victims of the PAP government, due to their lack of hindsight and that huge stench of arrogance to listen to the public when many threads about the issue was raised in and around mid Feb. To this day, neither did Mr Kelvin Teoh nor Josephine Teo nor PAP Taskforce apologise to Singaporean and the foreign workers.(Saw this comment on fb)Importantly, from 1st Feb 2020 onwards, the instruction ""Do not wear a mask if you are well"" started to be published in the Straits Times daily...

Also, read into how Dale Fisher responds and his choice of words when he pauses for a second at various points of the interviewBlardy dale again! -sing...l-learn-134024Quote:AuthorDale FisherChair, Infection Control, National University Hospital, National University of SingaporeQuote:Why Singapore isnt in lockdownIts pretty well-known that children are asymptomatic or only have mild disease, so there was no real reason to close schools. If you close schools, whats the trigger to reopen them?In Singapore, we want life to go on as normal. We want businesses, churches, restaurants and schools to stay open. This is what success looks like. Everything goes forward with modifications as needed, and you keep doing this until theres a vaccine or a treatment.On testing, the threshold for getting a test is pretty low. For the first week, we tested only people from Wuhan or Hubei province, then we tested anyone who had been in China within the last 14 days.By the end of January, all of our public hospitals could do tests. Then we moved to enhanced screening  we tested anyone coming to a hospital with a respiratory illness, anyone who had been in contact with a COVID-19 patient.Now, its even become more liberal.

"The trends have been wildly misleading in the first place. When you have say, 3000 to 8000+  test kits avalible for testing per day, you cannot possibly test our 330k foreign workers all at once.

If you encounter a sympomatic person in lets say, S11 dormitory. I think at this point you can just assume that he is infected without a test and that is pretty much what they have decided to do. Much better to utilize this test for someone in another dormitory/essential services to see if they are infected.

"-to-ta...39249.htmlSINGAPORE — Despite having heightened surveillance and tightened precautions in Singapore’s migrant worker dormitories early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures “turned out to be insufficient”, said Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean on Thursday (11 June).In a 25-minute speech televised on regional broadcaster CNA, Teo pointed out to the novel coronavirus being much more infectious than its genetically-related counterpart, which causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).During the 2003 SARS outbreak, Singapore recorded 238 cases of the disease and 33 deaths.In comparison, the city-state has confirmed 39,387 COVID-19 cases, including 25 related fatalities to date. Some 94 per cent of the total are foreign workers living in dorms.“On 25 March, we recorded zero cases in our dormitories. Just 10 days later, on 4 April, when the number increased to 26 cases, we acted decisively to isolate the dormitories,” said Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security.“However, the infectiousness of this virus and the communal living conditions in the dormitories meant that in a fortnight, by 20 April, we were recording more than 1,000 new cases per day in the dormitories.”While Singapore may have gained experience in tackling the SAR outbreak here, “no two crises are the same”, Teo said. The efforts to fight the COVID-19 outbreak in the migrant worker community is “a major challenge”, he added.On the mobilisation of the Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, Teo pointed out that the task is not a mission that they have been specifically prepared and trained for.“But they demonstrated their readiness and flexibility by stepping up to establish the joint task forces within days, to support their MOM (Ministry of Manpower) and MOH (Ministry of Health) colleagues who were already on the frontlines”, he noted.The taskforces had deployed teams to all the dorms to look after more than 300,000 workers and supported the MOH’s overall medical support plan.Teo reiterated that the authorities are currently testing and clearing every worker living in the dorms to ensure they are well and can safely resume work.“The operations are still ongoing, to bring the dorm situation fully under control. But the number of daily cases has already come down to between a third and half of the peak.

I'm surprised to see that some SGers don't know how little the typical Bangla earns - $17-$18 a day. Yeah, that's a lot back in rural Bangladesh BUT they pay SG prices for food etc and there's the huge payment for the middlemen.

HDB and other developers are reaping in HUGE profits by exploiting these workers. They don't need to invest in safer or more efficient equipment and practices - why rent more machinery when you can get a bunch of Banglas to do the work by hand (literally). Developers don't pass the savings to buyers anyway, so there's nothing to be lost by paying workers more and giving them decent welfare.

In other developed countries (ex the Emirates), construction workers are paid professional wages, have decent working conditions.

"> # S'pore must be prepared to pay higher construction costs due to new Covid-19 regulations: Wong

> Everyone in Singapore must be prepared to pay higher costs for construction work in Singapore due to Covid-19 safety measures, says Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong.

> Wong, who jointly heads the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on Covid-19 with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, said this in a press conference on Friday, May 15, referring to anticipated rises in cost associated with new measures that are being imposed on the construction industry as its workers return to work on critical projects.

> Testing scaled up, construction costs higher

> Wong said that the government intends to test all construction workers who are working every two weeks:

> ""(It) will scale up and we want to test all the workers who are working, who will be resuming work, and it will be done on a regular basis. This will be a new regulatory requirement on top of all the other safe distancing measures that we have put in place that we are talking about, that contractors will now have to uphold, so I have no doubt, as with all regulatory requirements, the principle must be that the company must bear the cost.""

> He added:

> ""So I have no doubt that it will mean construction costs in Singapore will be higher because of these regulatory requirements. And all of us have to be prepared to pay this higher cost, because we want construction work to be done safely in Singapore from henceforth.""

> Workers heading back to construction sites

> Also at the press conference, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) announced that an additional 20,000 construction workers, constituting about 5 per cent of the construction workforce in Singapore, will be returning to work from June 2 onwards.

> To ensure that all these workers remain healthy and Covid-19-free as far as possible, both large-scale and individual measures will be implemented.

> These include requiring each worker to download the TraceTogether app and wear a mask while working.

> At the worksites, workers must be divided into different teams, minimise interaction with other workers as much as possible, and the sites must also be equipped with sufficient hand wash stations and hand sanitisers.

> The workers must also have dedicated transport to and from their accommodations, if they are not able to live in quarters on-site, which will also be arranged to take into account safe distancing measures and to group workers involved in the same projects together.

"The coronavirus crisis has shone a light on the plight of foreign workers and their unique challenges, including the need to keep their families back home financially secure. One worker has managed to resolve that issue with a mobile app while helping his fellow workers stay infection-free. Read more at straitstimes.com. -freeMr Ganesan Muruganandam stands out among the 323,000 migrant workers in dormitories for his heroic efforts in saving his colleagues from the misery of the coronavirus infection.While infection rates among migrant workers in dormitories soar, accounting for about 90 per cent of Singapore’s confirmed cases as of Sunday (May 17), the company-owned dorm he shares with his colleagues has maintained a remarkable slate of zero infections, thanks to his early efforts.When China reported its first few cases of Covid-19 last December, the workplace safety and health coordinator seized the initiative to stay updated with the latest news reports, Ministry of Manpower bulletins, and other reliable online sources that were reporting on the coronavirus.As a safety coordinator, I have to brief my workers and supervisors on the necessary precautions that they should take every day. So I had to figure out what was going on,” explains the 32-year-old.After some research, he recommended that the home improvement company he works at adopt safety measures such as daily temperature checks, safe distancing, wearing masks and encouraging good personal hygiene habits to prevent the spread of the virus.The company acted on his advice as early as Jan 28.

"Why the PAP has failed14 Feb - there was a foreign worker tested positive for COVID-19 and he was rushed into ICU a day later. 17 Feb - 2 more foreign workers were tested positive for the virus. 18 Feb - it was revealed that they formed a new cluster from a work site.News came out and employers rushed to send their foreign workers, who are unwell, to the hospital for a swab test.19 Feb - MOM published a news article from Mr Kelvin Teoh (divisional director of MOM for foreign workers) that employers must not send the foreign workers to the hospital or they may have their WORK PASS privileges suspended. Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet. The poor foreign workers in numbers of 300,000 became victims of the PAP government, due to their lack of hindsight and that huge stench of arrogance to listen to the public when many threads about the issue was raised in and around mid Feb.

"> # No Singapore residents among 214 new COVID-19 infections; 3 community cases

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported 214 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Monday (15 June) noon, bringing the total number of cases to 40,818.

> “Based on our investigations so far, there are three cases in the community, all of whom are work pass holders. There are no Singaporean/permanent resident cases,” said the MOH, adding that the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories.

> The ministry said that more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of over 2,700 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Jurong Penjuru Dormitory, and Tuas View Dormitory.

> The four are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some 400,000 such workers live in dorms here in Singapore.

> Some 400,000 such workers live in dorms here in Singapore, of which about 10 per cent have been cleared of the infection, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on 1 June during a press conference.

> Over 20,000 infected foreign workers have recovered, added Teo.

> The story will be updated later at night.

> MOH STATEMENT IN FULL

> With 781 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Sunday, 29,589 cases – some 73 per cent of the total tally – have fully recovered from the infection.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while two are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Over 10,000 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 26 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, 10 others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and another three, including the 44-year-old male Indian national who died on Monday, whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> As of 8 June, the ministry has conducted 488,695 swab tests, of which 284,963 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 85,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 50,000 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

Who's gonna pay for the additional rooms? Their employers? Certainly they will try their ways to find loopholes. And if it becomes unprofitable for the employers, who will want to dabble in the business. So will the government pay for the upgrades in housing then? Of course not, imagine all the uproars that will be caused.

"Way back in January, opposition strategy leader Alex Tan zhixiang correctly predicted that foreign workers will be the weakest link in Singapore.  Alex also correctly pointed out the fake news by the government like People's Association claiming the virus will not spread in crowded places, the shortage of N95 face masks, the imminent border closure and the eventual shortage of essential goods in Singapore.Alex was also the first one who wrote that not wearing a face mask in public is going to be catastrophic, and even called Lee Hsien Loong a fool, and his WHO adviser Dale Fisher a Trojan Horse for issuing the advice.Alex also repeatedly warned that local transmission is out of control, and nobody listened. Is Alex claiming credits? Well, Alex is just giving credits where it is due. Alex did hit all the right buttons after all.For today's chaos, Alex still has solutions. Again, Alex will reveal them only when it is too late.Why? Because  Alex is not a MP or a Minister.

"This is a very good piece by TWC2. The whole economic doctrine need to change in SG with regards to cheap labour.

Beside the pure dignity and human rights argument I think from my observations there is no point with cheap labour. I think it damages SG. There is this idea that oh if we increase the salaries and working conditions our HDB will be more expensive etc. I dont think thats the case. How much do we even know about the man-hours spent on an HDB? How many hours is productive skilled hours? What about inefficiencies?

The addiction to cheap labour drives inefficiencies and unproductivity. Most bosses just throws more workers at the problem instead of thinking how can i solve this better this time and next time. Skills dont buildup because the workers change all the time. Workers dont have the loyalty and pride in their work. These bosses are not thinking at all how do i upskill my workforce, what machines or workprocesses should i improve etc.

In a previous job i was working with shipyards. Contracts for construction of oilrigs was basically a competition between South Korea and Singapore. 
The contract amounts was only marginally cheaper in SG than South Korea. In the end South Korea got far more projects and expanded far more than SG. It was estimate that SG spent 2-3x the manhours for the same project.

On a new construction project in an SG shipyard it’s common to see up to a thousand workers onboard at any given time by numerous different subcontractors doing their own thing. Bruteforce with lots of workers to get things done.

Going to an South Korean yard you dont see even a fifth of the workers onboard and vast majority is employees of the shipyard. Why? One reason is they thought heavily about making ship-parts modular that can be made separately without clash of workers. Main reason they had that system was the south koreans has prided themselves in competence of what they do, invested in technology and so forth. A good skilled worker also gets paid more. A skilled worker moves to improve ones worktask etc etc. Its an continuous improvement process.

Cheap labour may have had its benefit in the early days of rapid expansion of SG. But its now incredibly outdated. Productivity improvements are minimal. Why pay 1500/month(incl levies etc) for unproductive worker when we can have good skilled workers for say 2500-3000+/month. With good work conditions, technology and pay also locals will do this work same as in other countries without cheap labour.",2020-05-03 16:33:40,reddit,good piece twc2 whole economic doctrine need change sg regards cheap labour beside pure dignity human rights argument think observations no point cheap labour think damages sg idea oh increase salaries working conditions hdb expensive etc dont think thats case much even know man hours spent hdb many hours productive skilled hours inefficiencies addiction cheap labour drives inefficiencies unproductivity bosses throws problem instead thinking solve better time next time skills dont buildup change time dont loyalty pride work bosses not thinking upskill workforce machines workprocesses should improve etc previous job working shipyards contracts construction oilrigs basically competition south korea singapore contract amounts marginally cheaper sg south korea end south korea got far projects expanded far sg estimate sg spent 2 3x manhours project new construction project sg shipyard common see thousand onboard given time numerous different subcontractors thing bruteforce lots get things done going south korean yard dont see even fifth onboard vast majority employees shipyard one reason thought heavily making ship parts modular made separately without clash main reason system south koreans prided competence invested technology forth good skilled also gets paid skilled moves improve ones worktask etc etc continuous improvement process cheap labour may benefit early days rapid expansion sg incredibly outdated productivity improvements minimal pay 1500 month incl levies etc unproductive good skilled say 2500 3000 month good work conditions technology pay also locals work countries without cheap labour

Why? Because the workers are at a disadvantage. They get into debt coming to Singapore and they have no ability to walk out of a bad contract or working condition. The moment they lose their visa, they lose their income, go bankrupt, and were evicted. They can't switch employers. Governments see to it that the employees are punished that way.

Therefore, more cases doesn't necessarily guarantee more deaths, but the high risk people that catch it will drive more deaths.

"Why the PAP has failed14 Feb - there was a foreign worker tested positive for COVID-19 and he was rushed into ICU a day later. 17 Feb - 2 more foreign workers were tested positive for the virus. 18 Feb - it was revealed that they formed a new cluster from a work site.News came out and employers rushed to send their foreign workers, who are unwell, to the hospital for a swab test.19 Feb - MOM published a news article from Mr Kelvin Teoh (divisional director of MOM for foreign workers) that employers must not send the foreign workers to the hospital or they may have their WORK PASS privileges suspended. Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet. The poor foreign workers in numbers of 300,000 became victims of the PAP government, due to their lack of hindsight and that huge stench of arrogance to listen to the public when many threads about the issue was raised in and around mid Feb. To this day, neither did Mr Kelvin Teoh nor Josephine Teo nor PAP Taskforce apologise to Singaporean and the foreign workers.(Saw this comment on fb)This should be a sticky buddy.

"This is my take and analysis on the current situation. The measures we have implemented seem to be working, local cases (outside of foreign workers, worker dormitories and living quarters) are going down. We can confirm that home space/living density is one of the key contributory factors for the spread of COVID-19 despite heat/humidity being a key deterrent. The Singapore government should start to do the same segmentation procedures to test, separate, space out and relocate all foreign workers if necessary for all remaining foreign dormitories and living quarters which are not isolated currently. This needs to be done now, proactively and aggressively. Singapore’s problem is unique due to our high dependence and reliance on foreign workers. In order to resolve the issue of the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore, stopping the spread of this virus in the foreign quarter dormitories and living quarters is the paramount key. I hope the authorities have already realise this and are putting in place, proactive and aggressive measures to stop COVID-19 from spreading amongst all cramped quarters in Singapore. We solve this, we will solve 90% of the COVID-19 cases and the spread of in Singapore. If we fail to do so, there is a high chance that the virus will reactivate it again for a third wave even if there is a drop of COVID-19 cases initially and the next few weeks. We have to remember that it is likely that the virus could have been circulating in the foreign dormitories as early as February, reaching the stage it has today.",2020-04-13 12:48:00,hardwarezone,take analysis current situation measures implemented seem working local outside living quarters going confirm home space living density one key contributory factors spread despite heat humidity key deterrent singapore government should start segmentation procedures test separate space relocate necessary remaining living quarters not isolated currently needs done proactively aggressively singapore problem unique due high dependence reliance order resolve issue spread singapore stopping spread quarter living quarters paramount key hope authorities already realise putting place proactive aggressive measures stop spreading amongst cramped quarters singapore solve solve 90 spread singapore fail high chance reactivate third wave even drop initially next weeks remember likely could circulating early february reaching stage today

"I believe an earlier lockdown would have prevented spreading in dorms as well.

Let’s say there are three dorms, Dorms A, B and C.

On February 19, a person from Dorm A met someone from Dorm B at Mustafa. The person from Dorm A passed the coronavirus to the person from Dorm B. The residents of Dorm B thus became infected. An earlier lockdown would have prevented this transmission, but it was unreasonable to lockdown in February

However, on March 26, a person from Dorm B met a person from Dorm C at an non-essential construction site. The person from Dorm B passed the virus to the person from Dorm C. The residents of Dorm C thus became infected. In this case, had we locked down sometime earlier in March, we would have prevented the transmission of the virus from Dorm B to Dorm C.

Its not like all the dorms are next to each other, and its not like all dorms in Singapore are affected by this virus. An earlier lockdown would have prevented cross-spreading between different dormitories.

"When was the last time you mingled with one of those FWs or had an overnight chalet stay in their dorms? Probably never. Most locals never mingle with them. Let's call a spade a spade please: they have never been considered part of the community. I don't see why this fact should trigger anyone. Which is why even though for decades their living conditions have not been great, nothing has been done because no one cares enough about it. You probably didn't give a fuck. This is not some fantasy world where people living in a same country automatically become a single community filled with friendship and love and respect and rainbows.

But you miss the objective in splitting the data set. It's useful to segregate the data because a vast majority of the transmissions were within their dorms which you have never stepped a foot into your whole life. Among people you didn't care existed until recently. [Among already isolated clusters.](-19/advisory-on-salary-payment-to-foreign-workers)

You then say, oh but they are free to go to my shopping malls and parks and what not. So rising transmission cases in FWs must then imply rising cases among the rest of the SG community right? But the data isn't showing that. There is no proportional spike. We had seen a proportional spike when thousands of people came back from overseas back to their families.

You will then say, oh but that's because they are testing FWs more and not testing locals enough. But that assumes that suddenly we are testing locals less, which is false. We have also had some of the highest per capita tests conducted even before the FW cases exploded. The extremely low death rates also suggests that the reported cases are a lot closer to the actual, so there is little evidence of the high undetected levels of community spread that fearmongers are postulating.

">On hygiene in dorms, Mr Cheah, who is also president of the Dormitory Association of Singapore, said **the reality has been distorted by inaccurate information on social media**.  
>  
>**""The dorms in Singapore are governed by better legislation than that in many countries with a migrant worker population,"" he said.**

This says absolutely nothing and is barely a rebuttal to the videos showing the sordid conditions that the workers were living in. Which other first world countries have huge migrant worker populations? How dare this guy, who knows he is speaking on behalf the dorm operators, speak as though the dorm operators deserve a part on the back for simply not being worse than Dubai and Saudi Arabia? He even has the gall to claim that ""reality has been distorted"" without offering an ounce of proof that the conditions shown in the videos were unrepresentative of realities on the ground. We're not expecting dorm operator CEOs to commit seppuku, but at least have the bare decency to admit that mistakes were made. God.

Also just because there is legislation doesn't mean that these have been adhered to or properly enforced. Otherwise, [we wouldn't have half of dorms breaching regulations last year](-half-of-large-dorms-breach-rules-each-year-minister).

>For the 2019 financial year, the net profits of Centurion, Wee Hur and Lian Beng from their dormitory and other businesses averaged over $35 million.  
>  
>But, according to Mr Cheah, the bulk of dorm operators have been struggling in the last few years due to lower-than-projected occupancy, payment delinquency and bad debts.

If the hard statistics that we have are showing $35 million a year in profits for the big dorm operators, then Mr Cheah better bring out some real proof that dorm operators in general are actually struggling with operating costs. Otherwise, it would seem awfully convenient that only the operators that have disclosed their financial performances to the public are doing well, while all the other operators are apparently barely making profits.",2020-05-26 16:28:52,reddit,hygiene mr cheah also president association singapore said reality distorted inaccurate information social media singapore governed better legislation many countries population said says absolutely nothing barely rebuttal videos showing sordid conditions living first world countries huge populations dare guy knows speaking behalf operators speak though operators deserve part back simply not worse dubai saudi arabia even gall claim reality distorted without offering ounce proof conditions shown videos unrepresentative realities ground not expecting operator ceos commit seppuku least bare decency admit mistakes made god also legislation doesn mean adhered properly enforced otherwise wouldn half breaching regulations last year half large breach rules year minister 2019 financial year net profits centurion wee hur lian beng businesses averaged 35 million according mr cheah bulk operators struggling last years due lower projected occupancy payment delinquency bad debts hard statistics showing 35 million year profits big operators mr cheah better bring real proof operators general actually struggling operating costs otherwise would seem awfully convenient operators disclosed financial performances public well operators apparently barely making profits

Life & work has taken me to many places, In the 80's I was in construction mixing with the likes of Thai's & Philipines. Their accomodation would be the actual HDB flats or carpark or posh apartments they were building.Cooking facilities were whatever were around at that time.Domestic maids were from the same countries.Weekends were usually a bit chaotic & fights were a common thing.
Then I did a bit of off shore works (Seraya island ) & by this time the likes of Bangladeshis Indians Myanmars have joined the workforce. Their accomodation is a bit better (purpose built dormitories)but the employer still had to make suprise check up on lodgings as this would make sure they play their part at keeping it up to standard.
Dont forget these guys usually work long hours & tidying up their lodgings is last thing they want to do.They usually save the housekeeping for the weekends but then social avtivities needs to happen on weekends.

So I have witnesssed a steady rise of standard but no doubt more needs to be done. Singapore being a small place n so much fast pace to the one that they are used to doesn't help the situation

-1045089?amp交流站：疫情时期不做无谓指责2020年4月13日Â*3:30 AM文/黎仕婉￼作者质疑：“客工宿舍病例大增，难道客工本身没有责任吗？”（档案照片）我记得小时候，我们一家人住在一间小小的政府组屋。空间虽狭小，却也收拾得井井有条。父母教导我们如何收拾整理，如何打扫卫生。我们几个兄弟姐妹还能把一个小小的窝，布置成温馨美丽的家。生活习惯和个人素养是从小养成的，看看现在那些在帮佣手下长大的孩子，有不少就是饭来张口衣来伸手，会做家务和打扫卫生吗？不会，因为生活没有教会他们。在新加坡工作的外国人，其中一些是派驻新加坡的高层人员，另一些是从事建筑和环境卫生等工作比较辛苦的外籍工人，有不少来自较落后的国家。他们离乡背井到外地谋生，生活习惯会伴随他们，比如用手抓饭吃、在树下和草地上纳凉、聚在一起喝酒聊天等等。在乡下生活的人，可能对蟑螂壁虎这些昆虫习以为常；城市人看到这些都会吓得尖叫。日前看到报道，一名前高官在面簿贴文说，新加坡以第三世界的态度对待客工，提到政府“允许”雇主让客工坐在罗厘车斗里，让客工如沙丁鱼般挤在狭小的宿舍里，宿舍卫生条件非常恶劣等等；看到客工坐在地上用餐他非常生气，看到客工疲倦时直接躺在地上他不开心。言下之意，新加坡并没有好好地对待这些客工。客工有聚一起吃饭聊天的习惯，有时在组屋底层用餐后，铺一张纸皮倒头就休息。只要不打扰其他人，大家也习惯了，相安无事。但我有时看到他们把饭盒和饮料罐子丢在一旁，造成环境污染很不好。确实，我们有做不好的地方，但我们也看到政府一直在改进。宿舍有床有风扇有柜子，还有娱乐设备，基本设施都提供了。重要的是，还有客服中心和义工帮忙解决问题。一名从事建筑业10年的人在上述贴文留言说，客工的居住环境已改变不少。新建的这些宿舍，床架、床褥和柜子都是新的，床位也是按房间面积安排的，符合当局规定的标准。另外，宿舍也聘请管理人员打扫卫生。关键是，住在宿舍里的客工是否尽本分？个人卫生到不到位？用了厨房有没有收拾并丢掉厨余？用完厕所是否有保持干净？如果只是依赖清洁工人打扫，宿舍是不可能干净卫生的。个人卫生习惯如果没有改过来，去到哪里都一样。有一个朋友曾出租房子给客工，两年后拿回房子时吓了一跳。厨房、柜子、沙发等都有蟑螂的足迹。朋友后来只好请灭虫公司将整间房子彻底消毒一遍。即便做到这一步，他还是让那房子空了两年，最后卖掉。指责和批评是极其容易的事。客工宿舍病例大增，难道客工本身没有责任吗？喜欢聚集和不注重个人卫生不也是原因吗？与其指责政府，不如负起个人责任。没有一个政府能将抗疫做到滴水不漏，新加坡政府已经做得很到位了。,2020-04-18 14:04:00,hardwarezone,1045089 amp交流站 疫情时期不做无谓指责2020年4月13日â 3 30 am文 黎仕婉 作者质疑 客工宿舍病例大增 难道客工本身没有责任吗 档案照片 我记得小时候 我们一家人住在一间小小的政府组屋 空间虽狭小 却也收拾得井井有条 父母教导我们如何收拾整理 如何打扫卫生 我们几个兄弟姐妹还能把一个小小的窝 布置成温馨美丽的家 生活习惯和个人素养是从小养成的 看看现在那些在帮佣手下长大的孩子 有不少就是饭来张口衣来伸手 会做家务和打扫卫生吗 不会 因为生活没有教会他们 在新加坡工作的外国人 其中一些是派驻新加坡的高层人员 另一些是从事建筑和环境卫生等工作比较辛苦的外籍工人 有不少来自较落后的国家 他们离乡背井到外地谋生 生活习惯会伴随他们 比如用手抓饭吃 在树下和草地上纳凉 聚在一起喝酒聊天等等 在乡下生活的人 可能对蟑螂壁虎这些昆虫习以为常 城市人看到这些都会吓得尖叫 日前看到报道 一名前高官在面簿贴文说 新加坡以第三世界的态度对待客工 提到政府 允许 雇主让客工坐在罗厘车斗里 让客工如沙丁鱼般挤在狭小的宿舍里 宿舍卫生条件非常恶劣等等 看到客工坐在地上用餐他非常生气 看到客工疲倦时直接躺在地上他不开心 言下之意 新加坡并没有好好地对待这些客工 客工有聚一起吃饭聊天的习惯 有时在组屋底层用餐后 铺一张纸皮倒头就休息 只要不打扰其他人 大家也习惯了 相安无事 但我有时看到他们把饭盒和饮料罐子丢在一旁 造成环境污染很不好 确实 我们有做不好的地方 但我们也看到政府一直在改进 宿舍有床有风扇有柜子 还有娱乐设备 基本设施都提供了 重要的是 还有客服中心和义工帮忙解决问题 一名从事建筑业10年的人在上述贴文留言说 客工的居住环境已改变不少 新建的这些宿舍 床架 床褥和柜子都是新的 床位也是按房间面积安排的 符合当局规定的标准 另外 宿舍也聘请管理人员打扫卫生 关键是 住在宿舍里的客工是否尽本分 个人卫生到不到位 用了厨房有没有收拾并丢掉厨余 用完厕所是否有保持干净 如果只是依赖清洁工人打扫 宿舍是不可能干净卫生的 个人卫生习惯如果没有改过来 去到哪里都一样 有一个朋友曾出租房子给客工 两年后拿回房子时吓了一跳 厨房 柜子 沙发等都有蟑螂的足迹 朋友后来只好请灭虫公司将整间房子彻底消毒一遍 即便做到这一步 他还是让那房子空了两年 最后卖掉 指责和批评是极其容易的事 客工宿舍病例大增 难道客工本身没有责任吗 喜欢聚集和不注重个人卫生不也是原因吗 与其指责政府 不如负起个人责任 没有一个政府能将抗疫做到滴水不漏 新加坡政府已经做得很到位了

"> # 7 community cases amongst 451 new COVID-19 infections in Singapore; total close to 39,000

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 451 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Wednesday (10 June) noon, bringing the total to 38,965.

> “Based on our investigations so far, there are seven cases in the community, of whom three are Singaporeans/permanent residents and four are work pass holders.,” said the MOH, adding that the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories.

> The ministry said more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of over 2,700 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Jurong Penjuru Dormitory, and Tuas View Dormitory.

> The four are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas.

> Some 400,000 such workers live in dorms here in Singapore, of which about 10 per cent have been cleared of the infection, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on 1 June during a press conference.

> Over 20,000 infected foreign workers have recovered, added Teo.

> The story will be updated later at night.

> MOH STATEMENT IN FULL

> On Tuesday, the ministry added one more public place to a list of locations – first published on 25 May – visited by infectious cases in the community for over 30 minutes.

> Hougang Green Shopping Mall at 21 Hougang Street 51 was visited on 3 June from 12pm to 1pm.

> The list – which excludes residences, workplaces, healthcare facilities, and public transport – will be updated on a rolling 14-day basis or one incubation period.

> With 509 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Tuesday, 25,877 cases – 71.5 per cent of the total tally – have fully recovered from the infection.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while three are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Over 12,300 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 25 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, nine others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and two whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> As of 1 June, the ministry has conducted 408,495 swab tests, of which 264,393 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 71,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 46,400 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

"I understand the sentiment. And it sounds good in theory, but this would not be feasible in reality. There's no way to calculate the 'ideal' ratio of wages. The 'greater good' argument is also purely an abstract idea. What is luxury? Is it anything above a landed home? A 3 bedroom HDB? A rented flat from the government? Redistribution of wealth promises equality, but it always comes in the form of equality of poverty. See literally every communist country. Also, if the wages were that close together, then your part-time cleaner who cleans the office would be earning close to what your median office worker who spent 25 years in education would. Which is ridiculous. No one complains about doctors and lawyers earning more than someone who studied sociology. But when it comes to business, suddenly every employee deserve the same as his boss.",2020-05-24 11:58:59,reddit,understand sentiment sounds good theory would not feasible reality no way calculate ideal ratio wages greater good argument also purely abstract idea luxury anything landed home 3 bedroom hdb rented flat government redistribution wealth promises equality always comes form equality poverty see literally every communist country also wages close together part time cleaner cleans office would earning close median office spent 25 years education would ridiculous no one complains doctors lawyers earning someone studied sociology comes business suddenly every employee deserve boss

"-highligh...er-dormitories5TH APR 2020    The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) had issued advisories on enhanced precautionary measures in dormitories to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission. However transmissions within foreign worker dormitories have continued to rise and we are seeing more confirmed cases and workers who are ill. The S11 Dormitory @ Punggol (2 Seletar North Link) and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory (18 Toh Guan Road East) are of particular concern.2.    The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has decided that further measures are necessary to contain the risk of further transmission among the foreign workers within these two dormitories. This would keep the workers safe, as well as protect the wider community from widespread transmission from these clusters. Both S11 Dormitory @ Punggol and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory have been declared as isolation areas. Onsite medical support has been deployed, along with provision of food and essential supplies.Measures to contain further outbreak3.    The S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, with 13,000 resident workers, and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory, with 6,800 resident workers, have been gazetted as isolation areas. Given the rising number of confirmed cases, this is necessary to avoid the risk of further transmissions from any potentially infected workers to others in the dormitories, as well as into the community. Workers who are symptomatic have already been isolated.4.    Within these two dormitories, precautionary steps have also been taken to protect workers who are well. All the affected workers will not go to work. Access to recreational facilities will be regulated to reduce the inter-mixing of workers. Movement between blocks is prohibited. Workers have also been advised to cease social interactions with others who do not reside in the same room or floor.5.    MOM is working closely with all dormitory operators, to implement similar measures within their premises with immediate effect. Efforts are also underway in the larger dormitories to reduce the density of their resident workers, by transferring some among them to alternative accommodation during this period.Support provided to workers6.    The workers will continue to be paid their salaries for the duration of the quarantine. Their period of absence from work is treated as paid hospitalisation leave as part of the workers leave eligibility under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA). Their employers are eligible to claim for the $100 daily quarantine allowance.7.    Arrangements will be made to cater three meals a day for all affected workers for the duration of the quarantine. They will also be issued with reusable masks, surgical masks, thermometers, hand sanitisers and other essentials so they can keep themselves safe and comfortable.8.    Onsite medical support has been deployed to support the workers residing at both dormitories. The dormitories have also implemented enhanced health screening measures, such as requiring workers to check and report their temperature twice daily, as well as the regular monitoring for fever and respiratory symptoms. Those who are unwell will be isolated and will be assessed by medical personnel for further attention. Support provided to companies with affected workers9.    Companies that are providing essential services with workers affected by this quarantine order will be supported and arrangements will be made to ensure these essential services can continue to be provided.Advisory to dormitory operators10.   Dormitory operators and workers living in dormitories are reminded of the importance of maintaining high standards of hygiene and cleanliness to safeguard their own health and those of others who are living in the same space. Safe distancing measures must be strictly adhered to. These include measures such as no inter-mixing of workers between dormitory blocks and floors, and for workers to stay within their rooms and to minimise interactions.11.   Social responsibility is critical in slowing the transmission of the virus. We need every individual to play their part in the fight against the virus. Those who are unwell, even with mild flu-like symptoms, should not be at work. They must see a doctor immediately to prevent spreading illness to others.MINISTRY OF HEALTH & MINISTRY OF MANPOWER5 APRIL 2020",2020-05-04 19:51:00,hardwarezone,highligh er dormitories5th apr 2020 ministry manpower mom issued advisories enhanced precautionary measures minimise risk transmission however transmissions within continued rise seeing confirmed ill s11 punggol 2 seletar north link westlite toh guan 18 toh guan road east particular concern 2 multi ministry taskforce decided measures necessary contain risk transmission among within two would keep safe well protect wider community widespread transmission clusters s11 punggol westlite toh guan declared isolation areas onsite medical support deployed along provision food essential supplies measures contain outbreak3 s11 punggol 13 000 resident westlite toh guan 6 800 resident gazetted isolation areas given rising number confirmed necessary avoid risk transmissions potentially infected others well community symptomatic already isolated 4 within two precautionary steps also taken protect well affected not go work access recreational facilities regulated reduce inter mixing movement blocks prohibited also advised cease social interactions others not reside room floor 5 mom working closely operators implement similar measures within premises immediate effect efforts also underway larger reduce density resident transferring among alternative accommodation period support provided workers6 continue paid salaries duration quarantine period absence work treated paid hospitalisation leave part leave eligibility employment manpower act efma employers eligible claim 100 daily quarantine allowance 7 arrangements made cater three meals day affected duration quarantine also issued reusable masks surgical masks thermometers hand sanitisers essentials keep safe comfortable 8 onsite medical support deployed support residing also implemented enhanced health screening measures requiring check report temperature twice daily well regular monitoring fever respiratory symptoms unwell isolated assessed medical personnel attention support provided companies affected workers9 companies providing essential services affected quarantine order supported arrangements made ensure essential services continue provided advisory operators10 operators living reminded importance maintaining high standards hygiene cleanliness safeguard health others living space safe distancing measures must strictly adhered include measures no inter mixing blocks floors stay within rooms minimise interactions 11 social responsibility critical slowing transmission need every individual play part fight against unwell even mild flu like symptoms should not work must see doctor immediately prevent spreading illness others ministry health ministry manpower5 april 2020

"The foreign worker has rented one bed and maybe one locker. He is responsible for keeping his bed and the area around it clean. 

If the toilet breaks down, you complain to the landlord and the landlord fixes it. But if a foreign worker complains about a broken toilet, and the dorm operator does nothing, do you think the workers know who to report to, how to file small claims tribunal? No, they just have to live with it. If a foreign worker gets moved into a room infested with cockroaches, he can try to keep his own bed area clean, and to convince his roommates to do the same, but if some of the roommates don't cooperate, what can he do? In a normal flat rental, if you trash the place, the landlord will keep your security deposit and fix up the place after you move out, maybe even give the place a new coat of paint to attract a new tenant. If a dirty dorm resident moves out, the dorm operator can just put a new guy into his bed. Because the work permit holders have no choice in where they live. The employers find the cheapest lodgings and assign their workers to go live there.

"The coronavirus crisis has shone a light on the plight of foreign workers and their unique challenges, including the need to keep their families back home financially secure. One worker has managed to resolve that issue with a mobile app while helping his fellow workers stay infection-free. Read more at straitstimes.com. -freeMr Ganesan Muruganandam stands out among the 323,000 migrant workers in dormitories for his heroic efforts in saving his colleagues from the misery of the coronavirus infection.While infection rates among migrant workers in dormitories soar, accounting for about 90 per cent of Singapore’s confirmed cases as of Sunday (May 17), the company-owned dorm he shares with his colleagues has maintained a remarkable slate of zero infections, thanks to his early efforts.When China reported its first few cases of Covid-19 last December, the workplace safety and health coordinator seized the initiative to stay updated with the latest news reports, Ministry of Manpower bulletins, and other reliable online sources that were reporting on the coronavirus.As a safety coordinator, I have to brief my workers and supervisors on the necessary precautions that they should take every day. So I had to figure out what was going on,” explains the 32-year-old.After some research, he recommended that the home improvement company he works at adopt safety measures such as daily temperature checks, safe distancing, wearing masks and encouraging good personal hygiene habits to prevent the spread of the virus.The company acted on his advice as early as Jan 28. A representative from the company has confirmed that there have been zero infections among their workers to date.Ganesan must be appointed to be Overall In charge of All FW dormitory... This example proven prevention of covid virus in FW dormitory is not impossible. And within current dorms structure. All it takes is Good dormitory operation management of good hygiene. Ganesan did it without spending multi million $$$$$$$$$ that will increase our construction cost.Like with LW predicted, cost of building will goes up!...  And this Good example also proven the rest of FW dormitory in which badly affected are extremely lacking in their daily Operation Management with regards to health and hygiene. I strongly recommend MOM or Josephine personally sit down with Ganesan and learn from his experience. ZERO COVID 19 CASE IN FW DORMITORY..WOW.   Josephine really need to investigate the reason why Ganesan can do it. And WHY OTHER DORMITORY CANNOT?.  Ganesan alone saved SG millions of $$$$$.While the rest of FW Dormitories wasted billion of $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ for SG...

"It is to paint a more realistic picture of what is going on in SG. Workers’ dormitories have been gazetted as isolation places so migrant workers are not coming out to the community. We still can. Like initially the cruise ship off of Japan wasn’t even counted into Japan’s infection count. Is it discriminatory? No cause it makes sense as everything is happening in the cruise ship. There is a clear and distinct separation. Would you rather have 100 unlinked cases popping in the community or 100 linked cases in the community? Both adds the same number to the country’s case tally but they show a different picture all together. The last thing the government want to do is to cause chaos. Many older generations do not follow the news properly and might also misinterpret the information. If you don’t distinguish the cases, the 900+ cases will see people rushing to supermarkets right now, stocking up on everything. They might also speculate and spread fake news everywhere.

">Are you telling me a gov filled with scholars could not have known that the dorms were the best breeding ground for the virus DESPITE repeated warnings from other organisations?

1) They didn't know of the risk.

2) They are unaware of the conditions at the dorm that would increase said risk.

3) They knew but didn't care or weren't proactive enough to take preventive measures.

I'm really not sure which is worse, but none of the excuses are justifiable.

>“There was a very specific reason we built these dormitories. They were designed for communal living, where the workers could live together, socialise with their friends, prepare meals they liked, practice their religious beliefs... It’s a supportive environment for the workers,” said Teo.

>In terms of living conditions, she described workers’ shared rooms as being about the size of half a badminton court accommodating five bunk beds, with “another 20 per cent for circulation space”.

>Such dormitories are also managed by professional operators, which are regulated.

>“Among other things, they have the responsibility to ensure modern sanitation and no over-crowding,” said Teo.

"You can’t compare Singapore to Australia as we don’t have as many people here to support the building industry. For Singapore’s economy to grow, we need to put our people in industries where value add is the highest. Think of a knowledge driven economy where the benefits can be scaled up easily. Menial labour(as much as it is necessary) is not one of them. This is not being entitled but outsourcing 101. Sure, paying such workers better is a solution but the money needs to come from somewhere. It’s easy to quote Australia but you have to quote their high taxes as well to be fair.

"I can see your logic, but what's your definition of ""contained""? I was thinking along the lines of the gov letting the majority of the population resume work after 4 May, with the exception of those businesses that require Bangla workers. Masks and social distancing etc will still be maintained and enforced with fines whenever caught.The problem with lockdowns is that govs all over the world (except probably China) have no exit strategy. Malaysia is a good example.....Well, personally for me, I would want zero cases for 2 weeks before lifting the lockdown.But I am not an epidemiologist. So I will defer condition parameter settings for lifting a lockdown to trained professional epidemiologists with no political bias/obligations. Disease outbreaks are not new in human history. Surely WHO or CDC or whatever have protocols on when a disease outbreak can be deemed as contained/eradicated/resolved etc.No such thing as no exit strategy since the final aim for any country is simply to have no more cases. Its just that this kind of things, politicians will not want to discuss openly with the public. Don't dare to jinx, don't want to over commit. Ditto for doctors/epidemiologists.No. No such thing as half lifting, letting majority of people go back to work after May 4th. Do things cannot half-fark, like this half-fark SG lockdown. Only today then say wear masks ish now mandatory. If PAP never say must wear masks, still will have some cockanadons refuse to wear, just cause they don't want to.Even today, mandatory mask wearing, they still allow for exceptions eg no need to wear masks for duration of exercise. After exercise, must mask on. Simi sai. Just ban exercise. People really want to keep fit, jolly well do static station training at home. Cannot run outside, just do high intensity cardio workout at home cannot meh?So just to go back to the original point of when to lift a lockdown, its not hard at all to update pre-existing exit protocols for disease outbreaks for this Wuhan Coronavirus. Other than that, all efforts should be focused on ensuring this virus is eradicated. Of course, if exit conditions are never met for a long time, then have to see how then. But no country barring China is yet at that stage.Even now, China also never say everything ok liao after lifting their lockdown(s). Their obvious fear is that there could be imported cases if China just fully opens its doors and resumes normal operations. Then China will headache again.For SG, being so densely populated, easy for infections to sexplode, but also easier to contain, cos small area mah. Because of that, SG should be able to lift lockdown earlier than other countries even though SG entered lockdown phase much later. But also, since small area means its probably easier for re-infections to occur, PAP cannot afford to ramp down the seriousness in its messaging about Wuhan Coronavirus. Otherwise, people will become complacent again, setting the conditions for possible re-infection wave.",2020-04-14 23:27:00,hardwarezone,see logic definition contained thinking along lines gov letting majority population resume work 4 may exception businesses require bangla masks social distancing etc still maintained enforced fines whenever caught problem lockdowns govs world except probably china no exit strategy malaysia good example well personally would want zero 2 weeks lifting lockdown not epidemiologist defer condition parameter settings lifting lockdown trained professional epidemiologists no political bias obligations disease outbreaks not new human history surely cdc whatever protocols disease outbreak deemed contained eradicated resolved etc no thing no exit strategy since final aim country simply no kind things politicians not want discuss openly public dare jinx want commit ditto doctors epidemiologists no no thing half lifting letting majority people go back work may 4th things cannot half fark like half fark sg lockdown today say wear masks ish mandatory pap never say must wear masks still cockanadons refuse wear cause want even today mandatory mask wearing still allow exceptions eg no need wear masks duration exercise exercise must mask simi sai ban exercise people really want keep fit jolly well static station training home cannot run outside high intensity cardio workout home cannot meh go back original point lift lockdown not hard update pre existing exit protocols disease outbreaks wuhan efforts should focused ensuring eradicated course exit conditions never met long time see no country barring china yet stage even china also never say everything ok lifting lockdown obvious fear could imported china fully opens doors resumes normal operations china headache sg densely populated easy infections sexplode also easier contain cos small area mah sg should able lift lockdown earlier countries even though sg entered lockdown phase much later also since small area means probably easier infections occur pap cannot afford ramp seriousness messaging wuhan otherwise people become complacent setting conditions possible infection wave

"> # COVID-19: Singapore confirms record 728 new cases, majority linked; total at 4,427

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (16 April) reported a record 728 more COVID-19 cases in Singapore – a 62 per cent jump from the previous daily high – taking its total to 4,427.

> The announcement also marks the seventh consecutive day with no imported cases and comes one day after the city-state reported 447 new cases.

> MORE TO COME

> The MOH on Thursday also confirmed that 31 more patients have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, bringing the total of recovered cases to 683.

> On Wednesday, most of the 1,496 hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while 26 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit, down from 28 on Tuesday.

> A total of 1,540 cases who are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19 are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Ten have died from complications due to COVID-19 infection, including a 70-year-old Singaporean man on Tuesday.

> Another two patients, who tested positive for the virus, have died from causes unrelated to COVID-19.

> At least 23 clusters linked to foreign worker dormitories have been identified thus far, including the largest cluster of 797 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol.

> As of Tuesday noon, the MOH said it has identified 30,646 close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 12,797 are currently quarantined, and 17,849 have completed their quarantine.

> In the MOH’s latest daily situation report, 7,700 of 65,300 issued stay-home notices remain active.

> The COVID-19 Temporary Measures Act, passed in Parliament last Tuesday, gives authorities the power to ban events and gatherings, or impose conditions on how they are conducted, during the “circuit breaker” period from 7 April to 4 May.

> Those caught flouting the enhanced safe distancing measures for the first time will be given a composition fine of $300, and a $1,000 fine for the second time.

> Egregious cases will be prosecuted in court. A first-time offender who is prosecuted under the Act can face a maximum fine of $10,000, or a jail term of up to six months, or both. A second-time or subsequent offender can face a maximum fine of $20,000, or a jail term of up to a year, or both.

> On Tuesday, authorities said that mask-wearing while going out would be mandatory and offenders will face similar penalties. Exceptions to the rule include children under the age of 2, individuals who are excused from wearing masks on medical grounds, and those doing strenuous exercise.

> People who flout their five-day medical leave or stay-home notices are also subjected to similar penalties.

> Part of the “circuit breaker” measures – announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 3 April – include the closure of schools and most workplaces. Only essential services like food establishments, markets and supermarkets, transport, and key banking services will remain open during the month-long closure.

> In a Good Friday address last week, Lee reiterated his call for Singaporeans to stay home, as COVID-19 cases continue to rise in foreign worker dormitories as well as in the general population.

> Over the weekend, the authorities issued a slew of measures, including the closure of beaches, facilities in parks and gardens and playfields.

> Stadiums have also been closed, while parents are not allowed to drop off their children with grandparents on a daily basis.

> Separately, all Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning from overseas apart from Hubei province must serve the 14-day stay-home notice, while those returning from Hubei must serve a 14-day quarantine.

> All short-term visitors are barred from entering or transiting via Singapore.

> Last Monday, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced an additional $5.1 billion Solidarity Budget to help businesses, workers and households.

> The government’s response to COVID-19 will total $59.9 billion, or about 12 per cent of Singapore’s gross domestic product.

> To date, there are close to 2.1 million COVID-19 cases globally – it took 83 days to reach the first million cases worldwide and just 14 days for the second million.

> Some 136,000 have died from the virus, with the US holding the record for the highest global death toll at over 28,000.

> At over 640,000 cases, the country also holds the record of having the largest number of patients globally, followed by Spain at over 182,000 cases, Italy at over 165,000, and France at over 147,000.

> China, where the virus originated, has reported over 82,000 cases and more than 3,300 deaths.

> Another infected FDW was Case 21, a 44-year-old Indonesian. Her employer, Case 19, worked at the Yong Thai Hang health products shop, which was one of the earliest clusters. The cluster has since been closed.

> With the number of infections among foreign workers living in dormitories shooting up, there has been speculation that maids may have come into contact with infected foreign workers on their rest days.

> A WhatsApp message claimed that the situation could ""very quickly spiral out of control"" if maids met infected workers and carried the virus back to their employers.

> Addressing these concerns in an interview with Lianhe Zaobao last Friday, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said: ""First of all, now (FDWs) can't go out, and second, when you drill down on the data, the rate of infection among foreign domestic workers is very low.

> ""The evidence we have so far is that they get the infection from their employers, not from outside.""

> STAY HOME

> On April 11, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said all maids must stay home on their rest days, except to buy meals or run essential errands.

> Mr William Lau, general manager of employment agency Maid Avenue, was not surprised by the low rate of infection among maids.

> He said: ""Even before the circuit breaker started, many FDWs were already staying at home and minimising contact with outsiders.

> ""Adding to that, MOM's recent announcement sent a very strong message to FDWs - it is no longer just an instruction from their employers.""

> A spokesman for the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (Home) said of the WhatsApp message: ""Perpetuating such messages targets the migrant worker community unfairly as it is speculative.""

> The Home spokesman said employers should not be unduly worried about their maids being infected since all parties are subjected to the same circuit breaker measures.

> Ms Josephine Chia, 44, a mother of two children aged four and six, said that while employers have valid concerns about infections among FDWs, the WhatsApp message ""irresponsible fearmongering"".

> Ms Chia, who now accompanies her Filipina helper to remit money, said: ""Of course there is a basis for worry, but we should remain calm and logical about it, especially as the low number of infected FDWs provides some reassurance.""

"A circuit breaker is a soft lockdown, excluding essential workers, since most people are staying at home. Given the number of symptomatic cases over the last 2 weeks, I am inclined to think that the circuit breaker measures are working for the wider community (excluding worker dorms, which is a whole other story).

If you look at the [MOH situation report](-19/situation-report), the number of total cases outside of dorms has trended down since the start of the circuit breaker measures on April 7th.

I assume the testing criteria for local cases outside of dorms have not changed, and if anything, GPs and polyclinics are probably somewhat more vigilant about suspected COVID cases showing symptoms given the escalating situation in terms of total case counts.",2020-04-20 16:13:29,reddit,circuit breaker soft lockdown excluding essential since people staying home given number symptomatic last 2 weeks inclined think circuit breaker measures working wider community excluding whole story look moh situation report situation report number total outside trended since start circuit breaker measures april 7th assume testing criteria local outside not changed anything gps polyclinics probably somewhat vigilant suspected showing symptoms given escalating situation terms total case counts

"A forum letter published in Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao that links the COVID-19 outbreak in dormitories to the personal hygiene and living habits of foreign workers shows ""underlying racism"", Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said.""I think the letter reveals some underlying racism ... Because it typecasts an entire group - several hundred thousand of them - as lacking in personal hygiene, on the basis of their background, because they all come from backward countries,"" he said in an interview with Lianhe Zaobao on Friday (Apr 17).Mr Shanmugam also said that the letter is xenophobic and deeply insensitive, and reflected a ""lack of understanding of why we have this transmission of COVID-19 amongst our foreign worker population"".Singapore has seen a spike in its number of COVID-19 cases in recent weeks, with the majority of new cases involving foreign workers from dormitories.On Friday, Singapore reported 623 new infections, of which 558 were linked to foreign worker dormitories.Kranji Lodge 1 on Saturday became the 13th foreign worker dormitory to be gazetted an isolation area, meaning residents will have to be quarantined in their rooms.To date, more than 3,200 of Singapore's 5,050 cases are attributed to foreign worker domitories.The forum letter, published on Apr 13, questioned if foreign workers were to be blamed for the rise in cases, pointing to their eating habits and alleged lack of personal hygiene.Mr Shanmugam, however, said that the number of cases at foreign worker dormitories were primarily due to communal living, pointing out that foreign workers live, work and cook together.""Personal habits are extremely important  washing of hands, keeping yourself clean are very important,"" he said.""But when you put people together, when they sleep in the same room, they cook together and they are in close proximity over a long period of time, of course there will be high levels of transmission.""Mr Shanmugam also acknowledged concerns over the living conditions in dormitories, saying that conditions in the newer dormitories were ""quite okay"", while standards in the older ones varied.""As (Manpower) Minister Josephine Teo has said, look, we will fix this up after COVID-19, and we will deal with the older dorms,"" he said.With foreign worker cases expected to continue rising amid aggressive testing, Mr Shanmugam said there is a need to educate people on the reasons.""The circulation is limited, they are in community isolation,"" he said.""The cross-infection from that person to the rest of the community, whether Singaporean or PR, or foreign worker, is extremely minimised through our isolation approaches.""Some people have also expressed concern that foreign domestic workers, because of potential interaction with foreign workers on their days off, could be another group at risk of being infected in large numbers.Current data shows that infection among foreign domestic workers is very low, said Mr Shanmugam.Foreign domestic workers have to comply with circuit breaker measures and must remain in their employers' homes on their rest days.""The evidence so far is that they get the infection from their employers, not from outside,"" he added.Looking at the bigger picture, Mr Shanmugam said Singaporeans have a duty to care for foreign workers and show them empathy, adding that the Government and community have moved to help them.Fifty-seven per cent of Singaporeans have been able to become professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMET) because of foreign workers, he said.""They clean Singapore, they build our HDB flats, they build our buildings, they handle our waste management, they form the base of our economy,"" he added.""And therefore they are helping us build our prosperity.""Mr Shanmugam cautioned Singaporeans against making sweeping statements about foreign workers, even as he acknowledged that racial fault lines run deep.""As Singaporeans, I would say, whether Chinese, Indian or Malay, or Eurasians, others, we are really kind, compassionate, generous people,"" he stated.""We are bigger than the sentiments expressed in that letter.""-12654924",2020-04-18 12:32:00,hardwarezone,forum letter published chinese daily lianhe zaobao links

"For your first point, when it comes to ""one month > two month"", I don't think anyone can expect the govt to really know the future and provide a proper timeframe. Regardless of whether they choose to use ""circuit breaker"" vs ""lockdown"", I think the govt in this case should not be at fault for not knowing how long the lockdown period should be. 

On the other hand, we should instead fault them if there was mismanagement that led to the lengthening of the lockdown period.

Yes, it would be bad for retailers, etc. Many people's livelihoods are affected. However, this sounds more like making COVID-19 a reason to blame the govt instead. It's not like the govt has directly made these people suffer. Has the govt changed any policies that contributed to these people suffering? If so, then that would be another possible discussion.

As for the point regarding the rules, I'll go look it up.

"I can't disagree that they don't have a passion for cooking. But I don't blame them either.

"There are a few possible reasons for this.The main one, is hospital capacity. As they've already indicated, most people will recover with only mild or no symptoms. Once you test everyone, you will need to isolate and treat them.In other words, it can be seen as a slower way to build herd immunity, and only addressing those who develop serious complications. ""CB""s are required when the spread is anticipated to exceed hospital capacity for serious cases.This would then allow the economy to hobble along, without coming to a grinding halt and falling though the floor.As for the dorms, it can be seen as a controlled environment.

" ""Migrant workers are viewed only as digits on a spreadsheet of menial labour, to be deployed as resources when necessary and kept out of sight when not.""She added that conditions at dorms have varied, with workers reporting hot and stuffy rooms and issues with food quality and quantity, some of whom were Bangladeshis fasting during Ramadan.Mr Mirpuri said the government cares for the welfare of migrant workers, giving free treatment to workers who show symptoms ""just like everyone else"".Meals and internet access are catered for workers being quarantined at the dorms, and during Ramadan, Muslim workers got their meals before dawn so that they could perform their religious practices, he said.Support is also given to employers so workers can continue to get paid and arrangements have been made for workers to remit money to their families.Mr Mirpuri said 3,000 public officers have been deployed to support dormitory operators and employers, and many Singaporeans have volunteered time, effort and money to complement the government's efforts.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has also publicly committed to caring for migrant workers like Singaporeans, he added. ""The scope and scale of our efforts reflects the responsibility we feel for our migrant workers,"" he said.MANY CHOOSE TO CONTINUE WORKING IN SINGAPOREIn her piece, Ms Han said the fact that about 20 dorm operators and an average of 1,200 employers are penalised yearly for flouting licensing laws suggested substandard living conditions are a long-standing problem that has not been effectively addressed.She noted that rights groups had urged the government to address issues of overcrowding and sanitation even before the pandemic hit the dorms, but the concerns were brushed off.""Now that activists have been proved right in the most miserable way, Singapore still struggles with seeing migrant workers as equally valuable members of the community,"" she wrote.In his response, Mr Mirpuri said any approach to migrant worker welfare must take into account practical realities like Singapore's ageing society, small indigenous workforce, and lack of a hinterland to draw additional workers from.Housing migrant workers in land scarce Singapore can never be straightforward, he said.The government decided to meet this challenge with dorms built to specified standards, which have been progressively raised, with laws passed in 2015 requiring large dorms to have recreational and health facilities, and some amenities.While dorms allow workers to socialise and relax together, any communal living space comes with risks in an infectious outbreak, he added.Recognising the risks, the government in January told dorm operators to take several precautions, more stringent than those for the general population. When cases grew sharply despite the measures, a massive effort was mobilised to take care of workers, he said.Ms Han had also said that the current posture toward migrant workers will hamper efforts for systemic change after the pandemic, and places them in an even more vulnerable position in society.Already stigmatised as dirty or threats to public order, they are now also blamed by some for the spike in Covid-19 cases or berated for not being grateful enough, she added.Mr Mirpuri acknowledged that the government's response has not been perfect. ""There certainly are areas we can improve. We are determined to learn from this episode and will do a thorough review after the crisis is over.""He added that some migrant workers have been in Singapore for as long as 20 years.""They have chosen to continue to live and work in Singapore, rather than go elsewhere or return to work in their home countries,"" he said.""Their revealed preference shows the reality of the migrant worker experience in Singapore.

"Cut back on the back-patting: Singapores coronavirus response loses its shine as critics speak outPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loongs government faces escalating criticism over a surge of infections at foreign worker dormitoriesMeanwhile, many citizens seem to be flouting tough circuit breaker measures aimed at containing a resurgence in community transmissionsBhavan JaipragasPublished: 9:26pm, 10 Apr, 2020A telecast of Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong addressing the nation regarding the coronavirus. Photo: ReutersSingapore, for months hailed at home and overseas as the gold standard for responding to the Covid-19 pandemic, on Friday moved to defuse escalating criticism over how it has handled a surge in infections within foreign worker dormitories that activists had earlier flagged as public health risks due to their cramped conditions.Also weighing heavily on Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loongs government were signs that a sizeable number of locals were not obeying tough circuit breaker measures  essentially a partial lockdown  that have been in place since Tuesday to contain a resurgence in community transmissions after initial successes in containing the outbreak.Lee, in a recorded video message on Facebook, said military medical and logistics staff had been deployed to the city states 43 foreign worker dormitories. The facilities house some 200,000 work-permit holders  many from South Asia  who are employed in the construction, marine and other low-wage sectors shunned by Singaporeans.Singapore migrant workers under quarantine as coronavirus hits dormitoriesLee said Teo Chee Hean  the senior minister in charge of security affairs and a long-time trusted confidante of the prime minister  had been instructed to oversee a new task force responsible for ensuring the migrant workers were cared for.The multi-agency task force is helmed by the commander of the armys Guards Unit  an elite rapid deployment formation.We are paying close attention to the welfare of foreign workers, Lee said in the nearly 10-minute message. The task force would ensure that workers had food and water, and Wi-fi to keep in touch with families and friends, Lee said.We have worked with their employers to make sure they will be paid their salaries, and can remit money home. We will provide them with the medical care and treatment they need.Separately, he urged the countrys elderly citizens to abide by the lockdown measures. Officials have warned they may step up enforcement and penalties amid reports that residents  a majority of whom are seniors  continue to mingle and gather in public places.Our chances of dying are much higher, and if we get infected and spread the virus to our friends around our age, or bring the virus back home to our families, then we put them in grave danger, the 68-year-old prime minister said, directly addressing older Singaporeans.Lees address to the nation  exactly a week after he announced the partial lockdown measures that began this week  came as local commentators became more vocal in criticising how migrant workers were being cared for.When he spoke last week, the plaudits were still flowing in.But since then the number of confirmed infections has risen to double that of Hong Kong, with the national tally on Friday standing at 2,108  a nearly threefold increase over two weeks.Many of the new cases are linked to clusters in the foreign worker dormitories.Five dormitories are now on a total lockdown  residents are expected to spend most of their time in their rooms  while the residents of the remaining accommodation are barred from leaving the premises.Those measures are more severe than the circuit breaker measures faced by the bulk of the city states residents, who are allowed to leave their homes to purchase food or exercise in isolation.Exacerbating the pressure on the government were media reports and accounts by activists about the conditions in one of the dormitories put on total lockdown. The Straits Times reported on Monday, based on residents accounts, that urinals in toilets were overflowing and that the kitchen had a cockroach infestation.A construction worker from the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu currently living in that dormitory told ﻿This Week in Asia conditions  including cleanliness in common areas and the quality of food served  had improved significantly in the days after the report.Most of us are now worried about two things: how long will this last because its very boring to be shut in for a long time, and what happens to our jobs when this ends? he said in Tamil, requesting anonymity as he believed his employer  a mid-sized construction firm  would disapprove of him speaking to the media. He said he spent his time singing to himself and posting video messages to his followers on the social media app TikTok.Another worker, 36-year-old Arun Singaram, a resident at the North Coast Lodge in the city states northern Woodlands district, said he had been using hand sanitisers and disinfectants regularly as the rising number of reports of migrant workers being sickened by Covid-19 worried him.While he was confident of maintaining hygiene standards inside his 12-person room, he said he was concerned about venturing into the toilet and kitchen.Officials have stressed that they have all hands on deck dealing with the fast evolving situation at the dormitories, and the Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on Monday issued a statement urging critics not to demoralise her staff.That had little effect in containing criticism from some of the countrys independent political commentators  many of whom had earlier credited the government for its fastidious approach in dealing with the crisis.In a commentary on Friday, the former newspaper editor P.N Balji questioned if the uptick in infection could have been avoided had alarm bells rung when five workers were infected in February.How quickly fortunes can turn. It was only a few weeks ago that Singapore was smelling like roses with the country being praised, both here and abroad, for its efficient handling of the Covid-19 crisis, wrote the one-time editor of the countrys ﻿Today newspaper. Today, the same government is struggling to contain the quick spread of the virus as dormitories for migrant workers open up a new battlefront.A general view of Westlite Dormitory, one of the worker dormitories gazetted as isolation areas to curb the spread of the coronavirus in Singapore. Photo: ReutersOthers wondered if a March 23 warning by local migrant workers rights group TWC2 had gone unheeded. The group, in a forum letter to The Straits Times, had urged the government to make public its contingency plans for mass infections in dormitories in advance.It cited how the risk of new clusters among foreign workers was undeniable because foreign workers are housed 12 to 20 men per room in double-decker beds [and they] are transported to work on the back of lorries sitting shoulder to shoulder.Then and now: Asia-Pacific landmarks emptied by the coronavirus pandemicSudhir Thomas Vadaketh, a local author, suggested in an op-ed piece that the risk had been overlooked because Singaporeans were preoccupied in self-praise over the governments efforts to quarantine residents returning from abroad in posh hotels at the taxpayers expense.With many basking in Singaporean pride and glory, societys gaze may have been diverted, Sudhir wrote on the ﻿New Naratif website. Little, if anything, has been done to address TWC2s concerns over the past two weeks.What can Singapore do to ensure that nobody else falls through the cracks? First, cut back on the back-patting and self-praise, and instead approach our problems with more humility and self-awareness.The welfare of Singapores low-wage migrant workers has long been a subject of controversy, although it only sporadically emerges as a subject of widespread national debate. The last time it happened was in 2013, following a riot triggered by the death of an Indian worker in a road accident.Public anger over the last week has manifested in an outpouring of donations for the workers, with an effort helmed by local social media personality Preeti Nair raising over S$215,000 (US$151,000) within 48 hours. A online petition for the government to do more to secure the rights of the workers has meanwhile obtained some 18,000 signatures.Of Singapores population of 5.7 million people, some 1.4 million people are non-residents.The city state had 284,300 foreign construction workers and 255,800 foreign domestic helpers as of June 2019, according to official data.Zhup:

Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet.

> More details will be released later on Tuesday, the ministry said.

> On Monday, MOH reported 573 new cases. Just over 5 per cent, or 16,383, of the 323,000 migrant workers living in dorms have tested positive for the virus as of Monday.

> The virus prevalence rates for work permit holders not living in dorms remains constant at 0.09 per cent, or 577 people diagnosed out of 664,000 of these work permit holders. That for Singaporeans, permanent residents and other pass holders is 0.03 per cent, or 1,229 of about 4.7 million here.

> On Monday, MOH said the number of new cases, excluding work permit holders staying inside or outside dorms, has decreased from an average of 20 cases a day two weeks ago to nine in the past week.

> The number of unlinked cases in this group has also fallen from a daily average of 12 cases two weeks ago to four in the past week.

> The number of new cases among work permit holders not staying in dorms has also decreased. The daily average was 22 cases two weeks ago, compared with 13 in the past week.

> As of Wednesday, 1,452 patients in Singapore have fully recovered from the virus and been discharged.

> Eighteen have died from Covid-19 complications and five who tested positive have died from other causes.

> Globally, the outbreak, which began in December last year, has infected more than 3.58 million people. Some 250,000 have died.

> The United States is the worst affected country in the world with more than 1.18 million cases and nearly 69,000 deaths from Covid-19 as of Tuesday.

"SINGAPORE — Foreign workers have been in the authorities’ sight early on in the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore at the start of the year, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on Monday (4 May).Delivering a ministerial statement in Parliament, she explained how the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) helped to prevent imported cases by limiting the return of work pass holders and monitoring returnees’ compliance with Leaves of Absence and Stay-Home Notices, among other things.“Throughout this period, migrant workers were also on our radar,” said Teo.“Back in January, soon after the multi-ministry task force was set up, MOM reached out to dormitory operators to be more vigilant and to step up hygiene. In fact, one of the earliest media conferences that Minister Lawrence Wong and I held was at the Tuas View Dormitory, after we inspected their quarantine facilities in early February,” she said.Wong helms the National Development Ministry and co-chairs the Multi-Ministry Taskforce tackling the spread of the virus.Teo added, “We produced materials in the workers’ native languages to encourage them to take steps to protect themselves. Subsequently, non-essential facilities in the dormitories like gyms and TV rooms were closed. Meal-times and recreational hours were staggered. Intermixing between blocks was stopped.“MOM officers also fanned out on weekends, to advise migrant workers to observe safe distancing measures and disperse big groups that were gathering at popular hangouts.”‘Narrow focus on rooming arrangements may not prevent recurrence’In February, the authorities detected the first COVID-19 cluster involving migrant workers at a construction site at Seletar Aerospace Heights. The five workers stayed at five different locations, only two of which were dormitories, Teo noted.“Thereafter, there was no indication of higher prevalence of COVID-19 among migrant workers, compared to the general community,” she said.Several MPs had raised queries on the outbreak of COVID-19 in dormitories. Jurong GRC MP Ang Wei Neng asked, among other things, about the lessons to be drawn from the management of dormitories and if safe distancing can be “practically practised” in the existing purpose-built dormitories.Meanwhile, Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng asked if MOM would consider raising the minimum gross floor area of 4.5 square metres for each resident in a foreign workers' dormitory; and not including the basic living facilities - such as living quarters, kitchen, dining, and toilet areas - in the computation for the minimum gross floor area.Nominated MPs Walter Theseira and Anthea Ong also asked if a Committee of Inquiry would be appointed to probe the COVID-19 outbreak in the dormitories.Responding, Teo said epidemiological findings show that within the dormitories which have clusters, not all blocks or rooms are equally affected. And across the different dormitories, infected workers were linked via common work sites.“At the work sites, it was not uncommon for the infected workers to take breaks together, share food and utensils. Likewise, infected workers from different dormitories had gathered during their rest days to socialise and shop, for example at Mustafa. Back in the dormitories, workers spent time with their friends, cooking, eating and relaxing together,” said Teo.“The virus may have spread through all of these activities, much like how it spread among family members, religious groups and even colleagues,” she added.Teo also noted that most infected workers showed mild symptoms of the virus and that many cases were uncovered only due to active case-finding or swab-taking.“This may explain why up to the middle of March, the cases of workers at the dormitories testing positive were few and far between. Once evidence emerged that the virus had spread in the dormitories, we decided to deal with it squarely and quickly, and mobilise whole-of-government resources,” the minister said.She added, “Multiple channels of transmission among migrant workers, as appear to be the case, also means that we need a multi-faceted approach to dealing with the outbreak. A narrow focus on rooming arrangements may not prevent a recurrence. This consideration underpins the comprehensive approach of the Taskforce.”-19-m...083406682.htmlwhy never built a separation dom in feb and wait till apr?everything last min",2020-04-05 17:12:00,hardwarezone,singapore authorities sight early outbreak singapore start year said manpower minister josephine teo monday 4 may delivering ministerial statement parliament explained ministry manpower mom helped prevent imported limiting return work pass holders monitoring returnees compliance leaves absence stay home notices among things throughout period also radar said teo back january soon multi ministry task force set mom reached operators vigilant step hygiene fact one earliest media conferences minister lawrence wong held tuas view inspected quarantine facilities early february said wong helms national development ministry co chairs multi ministry taskforce tackling spread teo added produced materials native languages encourage take steps protect subsequently non essential facilities like gyms tv rooms closed meal times recreational hours staggered intermixing blocks stopped mom officers also fanned weekends advise observe safe distancing measures disperse big groups gathering popular hangouts narrow focus rooming arrangements may not prevent recurrence february authorities detected first cluster involving construction site seletar aerospace heights five stayed five different locations two teo noted thereafter no indication higher prevalence among compared general community said several mps raised queries outbreak jurong grc mp ang wei neng asked among things lessons drawn management safe distancing practically practised existing purpose built meanwhile nee soon grc mp louis ng asked mom would consider raising minimum gross floor area 4 5 square metres resident not including basic living facilities living quarters kitchen dining toilet areas computation minimum gross floor area nominated mps walter theseira anthea ong also asked committee inquiry would appointed probe outbreak responding teo said epidemiological findings show within clusters not blocks rooms equally affected across different infected linked via common work sites work sites not uncommon infected take breaks together share food utensils likewise infected different gathered rest days socialise shop example mustafa back spent time friends cooking eating relaxing together said teo may spread activities much like spread among family members religious groups even colleagues added teo also noted infected showed mild symptoms many uncovered due active case finding swab taking may explain middle march testing positive far evidence emerged spread decided deal squarely quickly mobilise whole government resources minister said added multiple channels transmission among appear case also means need multi faceted approach dealing outbreak narrow focus rooming arrangements may not prevent recurrence consideration underpins comprehensive approach taskforce 083406682 htmlwhy never built separation dom feb wait till apr everything last min

"Hmm. Wont say its fake lah. Its just the standard. All other countries are doing the same on this as well including Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea etc. Only when you are sick and do not recover, then do you see the doctor again to do a swab test. The 5 day MC is just a delayed response, it does not increase the numbers but bring it to 5-7 days later only if you do not recover. Based on 3000 test capability for Singapore now, this is unreasonable as most persons with the same kind of symptoms as COVID-19 could number at least 30,000 daily. Tests can be ordered at most GPs and polyclinics now already, so if you feel strongly you need a test, you can just inform the doctor. My thinking is better not unless you dont recover. Actually ok wan, then you are waiting and queuing with somebody with COVID, you touch the desk of the nurse whos administering the swab test for you, after that you go home take out mask, accidentally touch your face etc. So better not. A 5-day delay is reasonable to filter out this virus. It is unlikely that you will not recover from a sore throat if you on antibiotics like Augmentin or Klacid for example. This is what I think haha.",2020-04-23 16:08:00,hardwarezone,hmm won say fake standard countries well including taiwan hong kong south korea etc sick not recover see doctor swab test 5 day mc delayed response not increase numbers bring 5 7 days later not recover based 3000 test capability singapore unreasonable persons kind symptoms could number least 30 000 daily tests ordered gps polyclinics already feel strongly need test inform doctor thinking better not unless recover actually ok wan waiting queuing somebody touch desk nurse administering swab test go home take mask accidentally touch face etc better not 5 day delay reasonable filter unlikely not recover sore throat antibiotics like augmentin klacid example think haha
