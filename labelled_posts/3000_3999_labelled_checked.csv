106,"> # COVID-19 tally in S'pore crosses 39,000 mark with 422 new cases; one S'porean among 5 community infections

> SINGAPORE ‚Äî The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 422 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Thursday (11 June) noon, bringing the total to 39,387.

> ‚ÄúBased on our investigations so far, there are five cases in the community, of whom one is a Singaporean and four are work pass holders,‚Äù said the MOH, adding that the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories.

> The ministry said more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore‚Äôs largest cluster of over 2,700 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Jurong Penjuru Dormitory, Tuas View Dormitory and Cassia @ Penjuru.

> The five are among the¬†25 dorms¬†that have been gazetted as isolation areas.

> Some 400,000 such workers live in dorms here in Singapore, of which¬†about 10 per cent have been cleared of the infection, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on 1 June during a press conference.

> Over 20,000 infected foreign workers have recovered, added Teo.

> The story will be updated later at night.

> MOH STATEMENT IN FULL

> With 655 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Wednesday, 26,532 cases ‚Äì 68 per cent of the total tally ‚Äì have fully recovered from the infection.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while three are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Over 12,000 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from¬†25 patients¬†who have died from COVID-19¬†complications,¬†nine others who tested positive for the virus have died¬†from unrelated causes, including¬†three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and two whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> ‚ÄúOnly cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection¬†will be added to the COVID-19 death count,‚Äù said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> As of 8 June, the ministry has conducted 488,695 swab tests, of which 284,963 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 85,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 50,000 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

> On Tuesday, the ministry added¬†one more public place¬†to a list of locations ‚Äì first published on 25 May ‚Äì visited by infectious cases in the community for over 30 minutes. Hougang Green Shopping Mall at 21 Hougang Street 51 was visited on 3 June from 12pm to 1pm.

> The list ‚Äì which excludes residences, workplaces, healthcare facilities, and public transport ‚Äì will be updated on a rolling 14-day basis or one incubation period.

138,"A new taskforce has been created to specifically manage the COVID-19 outbreak among foreign workers here.Announced at a COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce (MTF) virtual press conference on Thursday (9 April), the foreign worker taskforce comprises Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean as advisor, and members of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and Singapore Police Force (SPF). It has been operationalised since Monday.MTF co-chair Lawrence Wong explained that cases among foreign workers are increasing at an alarming rate, compared to the increase in the general population, which is more ¬ìstable¬î. The government therefore has to actively intervene in this ¬ìvery major and urgent issue¬î.The approach to tackling it is two-pronged, said Wong.First, the government will work together with dormitory operators to ensure effective management across all dorms. Secondly, there will be heightened public health measures in place, including active screening and testing of workers, and the provision of medical posts on-site at the dorms.Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said, ¬ìAn established, replicated, sustained approach has to be adopted. We have a responsibility to these foreign workers who have come all the way here at considerate expense to make a living in Singapore.¬îLiving conditions in dormitoriesSince Monday, steps have been taken to standardise the delivery of daily needs within the four dorms gazetted as social isolation areas. These include the timely delivery of quality meals, cleaning and removal of garbage up to three times a day and disinfection of the premises up to three times daily.These have been co-ordinated by nine-member FAST teams ¬ñ made up of SAF or SPF personnel and MOM officers ¬ñ since Monday.¬ìBy Tuesday, we had three FAST teams working with dorm operators. By Wednesday, we had put together 43 FAST teams, matching them with dorm operators,¬î said Teo. Some 400 personnel are involved in total.Standards at the dormitories have improved greatly, said Teo, and the government will replicate these measures and standards in all dormitories, regardless whether they are gazetted as isolation areas or not.This will affect some 200,000 workers in 43 dorms. More than 5,000 healthy workers who are providing essential services have already been moved out of the dorms. Places where the government is housing them temporarily include SAF military camps, Changi Exhibition Centre, floating hotels and vacant HDB blocks.The Manpower Minister also pointed out that authorities had already began taking precautions in the dormitories from end-January, with all returning work place holders required to serve Leave Of Absence (LOA) and subsequently Stay Home Notices (SHN). This policy started with China workers and was later extended to all returning workers.90,000 inspection calls were also made on those serving LOA or SHN. 90 individuals¬í work passes were also revoked in order to signal the importance of measures, said Teo.Teo said that ultimately, ¬ìWe need to thin out the dorms (and) reduce the number of people in order to have effective safe distancing measures.¬ìThis is really important, we have to get it right.¬î-19-t...122006700.html",1.0,2020-09-04 20:34:00,hardwarezone,new taskforce created specifically manage outbreak among announced multi ministry taskforce mtf virtual press conference thursday 9 april taskforce comprises senior minister teo chee hean advisor members singapore armed forces saf singapore police force spf operationalised since monday mtf co chair lawrence wong explained among increasing alarming rate compared increase general population stable government therefore actively intervene major urgent issue approach tackling two pronged said wong first government work together operators ensure effective management across secondly heightened public health measures place including active screening testing provision medical posts site manpower minister josephine teo said established replicated sustained approach adopted responsibility come way considerate expense make living singapore living conditions dormitoriessince monday steps taken standardise delivery daily needs within four gazetted social isolation areas include timely delivery quality meals cleaning removal garbage three times day disinfection premises three times daily co ordinated nine member fast teams made saf spf personnel mom officers since monday tuesday three fast teams working operators wednesday put together 43 fast teams matching operators said teo 400 personnel involved total standards improved greatly said teo government replicate measures standards regardless whether gazetted isolation areas not affect 200 000 43 5 000 healthy providing essential services already moved places government housing temporarily include saf military camps changi exhibition centre floating hotels vacant hdb blocks manpower minister also pointed authorities already began taking precautions end january returning work place holders required serve leave absence loa subsequently stay home notices shn policy started china later extended returning 90 000 inspection calls also made serving loa shn 90 individuals work passes also revoked order signal importance measures said teo teo said ultimately need thin reduce number people order effective safe distancing measures really important get right 122006700 html,1.0

Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet. The poor foreign workers in numbers of 300,000 became victims of the PAP government, due to their lack of hindsight and that huge stench of arrogance to listen to the public when many threads about the issue was raised in and around mid Feb.

193,Major Discrepancy found in MOH's situation report for the 3rd instance. This is between 10-5 and 9-5 situation reports.  This time there is a sharp drop of the number of cases of WP(STOD) cases from 627 to 466 people. WP(STOD)10-5 figure should be 627+11 = 638however it was reported as 466.638-466 = 172 cases shortfall.DORM10-5- figure should be 19971+860 = 20831however it was reported as 20961.20961-20831 = 130 cases increase.172-130 = 42 cases balance. Where did this 42 cases go? Look at the subtotal for community cases btw 10th and 9th reports.the figure for 10-5 should be 1129+17 = 1146however it was reported as 11881188-1146 = 42So that shows to me that subtracted cases from the period between 10-5 to 27-4 of the situation report and put it in the before 27-Apr figures at the top of the table.

Issue is gov brought this on themselves. If you are a worker unhappy with your workconditions you cant protest, you cant strike. The power-balance is skewed. This is formulated in the tripartism approach. Gov is leading that, Employers and employees are very weak in this power structure. If more power was in employers hands with empowered employees that may be a better approach as they could compete more and evolve naturally instead of what gov says.

In other countries this was one avenue in which productivity was improved. Workers demanded better pay and working conditions. Employers said ok i can give you that but then you need to be able to do this project with less people. Ok says the employee but i need a machine to accomplish that. Ok says the employer and so forth.
This dynamic doesnt exist in sg therefore so much of the burden ends up on gov.
Look at the security guards and cleaner sector. Gov actively intervened there to accomplish a better outcome. Leaving it to employers and employees nothing happened due to power imbalance.

And if so, are those conditions going to change?¬îWong replied that the living environment in the dorms has been steadily improving over the years, stressing that the real issue was that they were designed for communal living.Nevertheless, he said, ¬ìI think the lesson we've learnt from this experience is that with this pandemic, the unprecedented pandemic, the safeguards were not sufficient, and the design of the dormitories have to change.

Their livelihoods here will hang in the balance even after COVID-19 has been eradicated here, say experts. (Photo: TODAY / Raj Nadarajan)By Ng Jun SenBy Justin Ong11 May 2020 06:28AM(Updated: 11 May 2020 06:30AM)SINGAPORE: Mr Syedur Rahman Liton, 34, pines for his wife back home in Dhaka, Bangladesh, as he tries to put on a brave front about possibly contracting COVID-19.For the past month or so, the lifting supervisor has been isolating himself along with 100 other company workers at a factory-converted dormitory in Senoko Loop, part of a precautionary move to socially distance migrant workers living in similar accommodation from the community at large to prevent the further spread of the novel coronavirus.It is a sacrifice that these foreign workers are making for the rest of Singapore society, experts say. As a result, the country owes migrant workers a debt of gratitude, and possibly, a concrete commitment to change when the pandemic is over. The number of COVID-19 cases has risen sharply from the first four infections detected at a foreign worker dormitory (S11 Dormitory at Seletar North Link) on Mar 30 which were part of 879 cases in total at that point in time, to 22,460 as of Saturday (May 9).Mr Liton has reason to be worried - two of his friends, Asit and Zakir, who live in the larger purpose-built dormitories, have been diagnosed with the disease and hospitalised.‚ÄúWe all want to go home in good health ‚Ä¶ My wife miss(es) me more and more,‚Äù he said.When asked about his prospects of remaining in Singapore in the foreseeable future amid the pandemic, Mr Liton said: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think (I worry) about the future, because I understand the situation.‚Äù But for the 400,000 migrant workers living in Singapore, their future could remain shrouded in uncertainty for some time. Their livelihoods here will hang in the balance even after COVID-19 has been eradicated in the Republic, experts said.Amid the crushing impact of the circuit breaker measures and the drastic blow to the construction industry, will Mr Liton‚Äôs employer survive the economic drought that has already started? Will he still have a job in post-pandemic Singapore?The Big Read - foreign workers in Singapore 2Medical workers attend to a migrant worker outside a factory-converted dormitory in Sungei Kadut, April 28, 2020. (Photo: TODAY / Raj Nadarajan)While Mr Liton ponders over the future, his host country - Singapore - will also have to reassess its whole relationship with migrant workers like him, especially its ‚Äúaddiction‚Äù to cheap migrant labour, and examine whether the lessons learnt from the explosion of COVID-19 cases in the workers‚Äô dormitories could be used to implement meaningful changes. In the near- to medium-term, at least, what is likely to happen will be a reduction of migrant workers here as economic conditions worsen, said labour economist Walter Theseira.‚ÄúAt the same time, having fewer migrant workers means more room to make changes,‚Äù said the associate professor at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.With the renewed national attention on migrant workers, the Government has pledged to raise living standards in dormitories when the battle against COVID-19 is over.Already, there are some suggestions on what these changes can be, from having more living space per worker, more dormitories to house them, and tightening state regulations. Over the years, Singapore‚Äôs history with migrant worker accommodation has seen a general apprehension towards housing migrant workers in the residential community.In 2008, more than 1,400 Serangoon Gardens residents signed a petition against a dormitory situated in their neighbourhood, which they handed to then National Development Minister Mah Bow Tan.But beyond the dormitories, there are also wider questions to consider, said the experts. Should society start questioning its reliance on low-cost foreign workers? Will the economy be able to cope with increased costs of raised standards? Can people accept migrant workers living in their midst?For some insights into these issues, we reached out to various stakeholders in the industry of migrant labour, such as dormitory operators, construction firms, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), as well as labour academics and policy researchers. Ultimately, nearly all those interviewed said a significant relook at how Singapore accommodates its migrant workforce, both in the literal and figurative sense, is overdue. Mr Christopher Gee, senior research fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS), said: ‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt go back to the status quo ... We have ridden on our luck for so long and now it has come home to roost.‚ÄùTHE STATUS QUOThere are about 200,000 migrant workers housed in 43 purpose-built dormitories around Singapore.These are licensed dormitories housing more than 1,000 workers each and are required to comply with the requirements under the Foreign Employee Dormitory Act (FEDA), such as providing facilities that include sick bays and isolation rooms.Dormitory operators are also required to draw contingency plans in case of a pandemic, such as providing arrangements for quarantine.Despite this, around 20 of the purpose-built dormitories - nearly half - flout the FEDA licensing requirement on average each year, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo revealed in Parliament on Monday (May 4). Operators face fines of up to S$50,000 and up to a year in jail for Feda offences.Another 95,000 workers are housed in the 1,200 factory-converted dormitories; 20,000 in construction temporary quarters; and 85,000 work permit and S Pass holders in the construction sector housed in Housing and Development Board (HDB) flats, private residential premises and others.These are not covered under the FEDA due to their smaller size, though they have to comply with other regulations such as the building and fire safety codes.Each purpose-built dormitory house anywhere between 1,500 and 25,000 workers. By law, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) prescribes a minimum of 4.5 sq m per dorm resident for living space, which includes the sleeping quarters, kitchen, dining and toilet areas. Operators have largely kept to these minimum standards, as well as other environmental health guidelines by the National Environment Agency that states that there should be one toilet facility for every 15 residents. Each room can house between 12 and 20 workers, and the beds are often double-decked.OPERATORS: DORMS NOT BUILT FOR A PANDEMICWhile the purpose-built dormitories have met the needs of the workers during ‚Äúnormal times‚Äù, dorm operators said these large facilities were not built nor regulated to cater for a pandemic of such a scale.A spokesperson from Mini Environment Service (MES), which oversees operations at Jurong Penjuru Dorm 1, Jurong Penjuru Dorm 2, Blue Stars Dorm and The Leo, added that a dormitory ‚Äúby nature is dense‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe older specifications and designs of a dormitory were based on a functional approach and pandemic management was not a consideration in the design and use,‚Äù the spokesperson added.Managing Director of S11 Dormitories Johnathan Cheah said that the dormitories under his charge - S11 Dormitory @ Punggol and Changi Lodge II - are organised to accommodate residents who fall ill with infectious diseases such as chicken pox, measles and mumps.   ‚Äú(The dormitories) were not designed to accommodate the large number (of infected cases) expected during a pandemic,‚Äù he said.As of Friday, S11 Dormitory @ Punggol is Singapore‚Äôs biggest infection cluster, with 2,535 cases. When asked how the living space each worker has is allotted, the dorm operators said that this is largely up to the specifications of the authorities. Mr Cheah said that S11 Dormitory @ Punggol was ‚Äúbuilt to the authorities' specifications for dormitories‚Äù when constructed in 2015.   Agreeing, the MES spokesperson said: ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt get to decide on the living space. This is set by the authorities and the dormitories are built to specifications.‚Äù HELP FROM AUTHORITIESAs infections in dorm clusters began to rise early last month, an inter-agency task force was set up on Apr 7 to provide support to foreign workers and dormitory employers. With help from the authorities, operators have been able to lower occupancy rates within the dormitories. Mr Kong Chee Min, the chief executive officer of Centurion Corporation, who is in charge of ASPRI-Westlite Papan, Westlite Juniper, Westlite Mandai, Westlite Toh Guan and Westlite Woodlands, said that the leased tenancy of these dorms averaged 95 per cent or higher, while the actual residency was around 85 per cent. The Big Read - foreign workers in Singapore 3General view of Westlite Dormitory in Toh Guan, April 30, 2020. (Photo: TODAY / Raj Nadarajan)Thanks to the ‚Äúconcerted decamping efforts supported by multiple parties nationally‚Äù in the wake of the pandemic, occupancy has been brought down to about 65 to 70 per cent on average. ‚ÄúOn average, there are now about five or six persons living in an eight-bed apartment, and eight to nine persons in a 12-bed apartment,‚Äù said Mr Kong. Likewise, the operator at S11 Dormitory @ Punggol has been ‚Äúworking very closely‚Äù with the authorities to curb the spread of the virus. For example, the residents are required to stay in their assigned rooms and cannot come into contact with the other residents in different levels and blocks. This measure is part of a three-pronged strategy announced by Manpower Minister Teo on Apr 14. FUTURE HOPES FOR DORMSThe operators hope that the next couple of years will bring improvements to the conditions and living standards within the dormitories. ‚ÄúA review of standards for dormitory operations can only be good for the foreign worker community as it will help to raise quality levels across the industry,‚Äù said Mr Kong. Agreeing, the MES spokesperson said that the ability to ‚Äútear down‚Äù the dormitories with older specifications and update them will ‚Äúbenefit all stakeholders‚Äù.The issues which the operators would like to address include the long-standing conundrum of safe distancing.  ‚ÄúIf we are to prepare for future pandemic situations, the density of the dorm population needs to be addressed and employers need to set aside higher budgets for rentals, for instance,‚Äù said Mr Cheah of S11 Dormitories. Beyond deciding where to house the workers, employers also play a ‚Äúmajor role‚Äù in regulating the way employees use the premises, operators say.Mr Kong said: ‚ÄúWe do see employers who rent 12-bed apartment units, then choose to house only 10 or less workers in the apartment.‚ÄùEMPLOYERS: ""OUR HANDS ARE TIED""While migrant workers are covered by Singapore‚Äôs main labour law, the Employment Act, employers of migrant workers also generally assume a greater responsibility for their welfare, including food accommodation and healthcare, than if they had hired a local resident to do the same job.But while employers in the construction sector agree that changes to how migrant workers are housed are needed, several said the influence they have on their workers‚Äô living conditions is limited. It is largely not up to the employers to dictate the density or the living conditions within the dormitories, but for the operators to decide and the authorities to regulate, they claimed.  Mr Johnny Lim, executive director of Teambuild Engineering & Construction, noted that purpose-built dormitories are often densely populated due to the shortage of land and ‚Äúconcerns that these dormitories are in too close proximity to residential areas‚Äù.Mr Chew Char Choon, senior project manager of a real estate construction firm, said: ‚ÄúAs a contractor or dorm operator, we just take instructions from (the authorities) ... It is up to the Government, how they would like to control.‚Äù READ: COVID-19: Crowding, emotional health of migrant workers at dormitories concern employersWhile maximum room capacity and space for each worker may be set by the operators with prevailing regulations in mind, some employers may choose to house their workers in more spacious environs - but at a cost. Mr Nelson Tee, managing director of CHH Construction System, has been housing his 39 workers in three dormitory rooms that can hold a total of 48 workers.  He pays S$369 per worker monthly for their accommodation when he could have been paying S$300 had he housed them to full capacity, and has been doing so before the pandemic. ‚ÄúI book them for three rooms so I can spread them out,‚Äù he said.MORE SPACE WILL COME AT A COSTShould new guidelines cause housing to be more costly, not all contractors may be able to stomach this, the employers said. This is especially if they have long-term projects underway, some of which can last four to five years. Mr Chew said that should dormitories charge higher rates per worker, it would ‚Äúnot be fair to ongoing contracts, which are tendered based on old pricing‚Äù. ‚ÄúWhen the new guidelines come in‚Ä¶ it will affect (employers‚Äô) cashflow.‚Äù At the end of the day, some employers think it boils down to who would be willing to shoulder and split the extra costs. Mr Akbar Kader, managing director of Nan Guan Construction, said that he would like to see a ‚Äúsymbiotic arrangement‚Äù between the employer, dormitory operators, and the authorities, such that the extra costs are fairly distributed among them.  He added that a maximum rental charge would also make future operators more mindful during the tendering process - when they bid for the price of land on which to build their dormitories.   Exorbitant bids will be fewer if operators ‚Äúknow that they would have to provide specified facilities and meet operational requirements, and charge no more than what has been stipulated as the (maximum) price for rental of a bed space‚Äù, he said. If all the above is carried out, ‚Äúthe increment in cost (to the consumers) over the time they own the property will be very minute‚Äù, said Mr Akbar.  Some employers think that consumers should also see beyond the economic cost of the product and be mindful of the workers‚Äô efforts that go behind it.Mr Kenneth Loo, executive director of Straits Construction Singapore, said that most Singaporeans are not aware of the workers‚Äô hard work, and the tough living conditions they have to put up with.‚ÄúHow much people are willing to pay depends on the economy (rather than the workers‚Äô living conditions),‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúFor example, when you buy a piece of clothing, do you think of where it comes from? No, right?‚Äù The Big Read - foreign workers in Singapore 4An empty room at Westlite Papan dormitory on Apr 21, 2020, after workers in essential services were moved out. (Photo: TODAY / Nuria Ling)A PUSH TOWARDS AUTOMATIONOver the years, some employers have also turned to technology to help reduce their reliance on foreign labour. For example, Mr Lim from Teambuild Engineering & Construction said the firm focuses on prefabricated prefinished volumetric construction (PPVC), whereby entire rooms are first prefinished and fitted out in factories with the use of automation and machinery, before being transported on-site for assembly. These new construction methods ‚Äúeffectively transferred major portions of the work previously carried out on the construction sites into the factories‚Äù, he said.However, there is a limit to automation. Unless technological advancement allows machines to ‚Äúfunction like tradesmen‚Äù and be available, accessible and affordable, ‚Äúconstruction will remain a labour-intensive industry‚Äù, Mr Lim said. While both dorm operators and employers say their hands are tied when it comes to housing, commentaries over the past several weeks have jointly blamed the inadequacies by both parties for the outbreak.Experts say the time will come for a review to identify where the lapses are.Assoc Prof Theseira said: ‚ÄúEmployers and operators are quite a diverse group. Some appear to have neglected their responsibilities, others have simply been overwhelmed, and others still have discharged their responsibilities well. We really need some time to identify who did well and who didn't, and hold those who failed to account.‚ÄùGOVERNMENT: ROLE AS REGULATORAs the authorities hunker down to mitigate the viral spread, the Government is also looking into new housing arrangements for migrant workers who have recovered from COVID-19 through a pipeline of short, medium and long-term plans, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong.Mr Wong co-chairs the multi-ministry task force leading Singapore‚Äôs response to the COVID-19 outbreak.While details of these plans are not yet known, several suggestions have been raised, most notably, to increase the minimum standard for living space specified in FEDA.After all, it is too much to expect private operators and employers to do so on their own, said Mr Alex Au, vice-president of migrant worker rights group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2).‚ÄúEmployers and dorm operators have to watch their bottom lines. They are not welfare services. If the legal standards are low - which we feel they are currently - they would be foolish as profit-making enterprises to over-provide and drive up their own costs. ‚ÄúThat's what the Government is for - to ensure socially-conscious minimum standards, but to do so in an across-the-board way so that a level-playing field for all businesses is maintained,‚Äù he said.Mr Au called for a doubling of the living space per occupant to 9 square metres - equivalent to 10 workers living in a four-room HDB flat.Assoc Prof Theseira, a Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP), said a proper study is needed to determine what construes a reasonable standard for living space. ‚ÄúIf we come up with one set of standards for living for Singaporeans in a similar situation, for example, a long-term hostel, dormitory, or army camp residents, it would be quite unjust to apply a lower standard to migrant workers just because they are migrant workers,‚Äù he said.The Migrant Workers‚Äô Centre (MWC) also urged for changes to the FEDA to include all migrant worker housing facilities regardless of their size or type, stripping away the 1,000-bed threshold which allows the law to kick in. Said MWC chairman and former Member of Parliament Yeo Guat Kwang: ‚ÄúThis is something MWC has been calling for since the enactment of FEDA, on the evidence that the majority of the sub-par housing facilities we see and investigate in the course of work continue to come from factory-converted, or smaller dormitory facilities.‚ÄùOther suggestions from MWC include a minimum dormitory staff to residents ratio, so as to ensure that operators have sufficient manpower to carry out crucial work such as cleaning, operations support and security. More open green space should also be part of the dormitory requirements, which would allow for recreation and communal activities.Labour economist Kelvin Seah from the National University of Singapore‚Äôs (NUS) Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences said that these plans should include strategies to raise the hygiene standard in dormitories.‚ÄúFor instance, the plan may want to prescribe the regularity in which toilets, kitchens, and rooms would be cleaned, and the sanctions which dorm operators or employers may face if they fail to comply,‚Äù said the senior lecturer.But these suggestions would likely lead to substantially higher costs of housing migrant workers, added Dr Seah. DBS bank analyst Ling Lee Keng, who frequently reports on the commercial performance of the purpose-built workers accommodation sector, said that a more stringent law could result in a cutback in the supply of beds.‚ÄúThat could benefit the dormitory operators that are able to meet the higher operating requirements - bigger rooms and better facilities would naturally lead to higher cost per bed,‚Äù said the analyst, who had previously predicted that raised standards could lead to a consolidation in the industry.A MORE DIRECT ROLE FOR THE GOVERNMENTAside from regulations, could the Government also play a more active role in dormitory management?Speaking at an IPS webinar on Wednesday, Associate Professor Jeremy Lim, who is the co-director of Global Health at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, NUS, noted the existence of two separate ‚Äúmental models‚Äù that the authorities had for migrant workers and for the larger Singapore community.The policy response was guided by these mental models, that although migrant workers are part of the community, there are separate paradigms for the two groups, he said.READ: COVID-19: 'Not true' Singapore has reduced testing among migrant workers, says Gan Kim YongEmployers of migrant workers assume the responsibility for the workers‚Äô welfare, including healthcare, accommodation and food. Assoc Prof Lim said this is evident from the onset of the pandemic when the MOM asked dormitory operators to step up hygiene measures and issued advisories to employers.‚ÄúAs it became clear that employers were overwhelmed in terms of safe distancing and (providing) face masks, everything fell apart and the Government had to step in. To their credit, the Government mentally pivoted away from this mental model ‚Ä¶ quickly,‚Äù he said, noting the speedy establishment of community care and recovery facilities to house affected workers.Several observers had mixed feelings about the Government playing a more direct role in day-to-day dormitory management. Such services are best provided by the private market, said Dr Seah.But the Government could also take a leaf from the book for public transport operators which do not own the buses and trains, or from how the management of state-owned buildings are tendered out to commercial service providers.Assoc Prof Theseira said: ‚ÄúHaving dormitories owned by the Government, and then managed on a competitive basis by private companies accountable both to workers and the Government, may be an interesting model to consider.‚ÄùTWEAKING SINGAPORE'S ECONOMIC MODELA more fundamental question would be whether Singapore should continue to rely heavily on low-cost migrant workers, said experts.In Singapore, past crises have historically led to a rethinking of the Republic‚Äôs social compact - the combined series of unprecedented crises such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States in 2001, the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the global financial crisis of 2008 required national responses that ‚Äúthrew our planning out of gear‚Äù and necessitated the 2013 Population White Paper, said then Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean.With Singapore now facing what has been touted as  ‚Äúa crisis of a generation‚Äù, some, like Assoc Prof Theseira and fellow NMP Anthea Ong, have called for a committee of inquiry into the foreign worker dormitory outbreak to work out the structural changes that Singapore sorely needs.In his reply to the NMPs‚Äô call, Minister Wong told Parliament on Monday that the Government will review its overall response to the pandemic comprehensively in order to learn and improve.Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat has also set up an Emerging Stronger Task Force, which is tasked with making recommendations on how to reimagine Singapore‚Äôs economic strategies.One silver lining, from a policymaking perspective, is that the current worries about Singapore‚Äôs overreliance on migrant workers are aligned with the Government‚Äôs goal of raising the productivity of the resident workforce.This dates back to 2012, when then Finance Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam said the easy availability of foreign labour will reduce the incentives for companies to raise productivity. Since then, Singapore has taken steps to progressively reduce this reliance, such as tightening the foreign worker dependency ratio ceilings, said Dr Seah.‚ÄúThere is scope to reduce this reliance even further. By encouraging companies to rely less on foreign labour in their production processes, we can in fact nudge them to adopt smarter and less costly methods of production,‚Äù he added.Associate Professor Kenneth Paul Tan, from the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, said he hopes the review on dormitories, when it comes, will take in diverse voices from civil society in policy discussions.‚ÄúAnd I hope, most of all, that we have deeper discussions with a view to minimising our dependency on low-waged migrant workers, investing in productivity-enhancing technology, redesigning essential jobs to overcome unnecessary stigma, and designing more generous social safety nets for the many who will have difficulty integrating into a new and more resilient economic society.‚ÄùPEOPLE: SOCIETY‚ÄôS APPETITE FOR CHANGEIPS‚Äô Mr Gee said that this traditional mindset of relying on lower-skilled and low-wage labour has created a ‚Äúcategory of residents who have limited rights as a non-permanent resident foreigner and are treated differently‚Äù.If Singapore decides that in a post-pandemic world, it needs to elevate their living standards to a decent level that Singaporeans can accept for themselves, then another question will be what level would Singaporeans be comfortable with, said Mr Gee. ‚ÄúThe same level as the lowest-paid Singaporean household? Or lesser? We have to negotiate and discuss this,‚Äù he said.And then, there is also the matter of cost that society needs to bear.READ: MOM says working to improve conditions for S11 Dormitory, Westlite Toh Guan residentsLast month, amid the outbreak in the dormitories, Mrs Teo said that each time MOM attempts to raise the standard of living in these premises, it would face objections from employers due to the added costs that come with the move.‚ÄúNevertheless, I hope the COVID-19 episode demonstrates to the employers and wider public that raising standards at worker dormitories is not only the right thing to do but also in our own interests. We should be willing to accept the higher costs that come with higher standards,‚Äù she said. In this fundamental re-think of the role migrant workers play in Singapore‚Äôs prosperity, TWC2‚Äôs Mr Au urged the authorities to also look beyond living standards in dormitories, such as long-standing issues on the recruitment fees that migrant workers bear and the non-payment of salaries.Assoc Prof Theseira said: ‚ÄúFundamentally, the current structure is low-cost, and as a result, generally Singaporeans benefit in the narrow sense that we pay lower prices for anything produced by foreign workers.‚Äù‚ÄúEither our costs would go up, meaning more taxation, or standards would fall, meaning more potholes, uncleared fallen trees, et cetera, without so many low-cost workers. ‚ÄúThat means that we have collectively contributed to current conditions for foreign workers, because we have found these low costs and high standards of service too compelling to raise too many questions about their treatment and the market structure,‚Äù he added.SINGAPORE ATTITUDES TOWARDS MIGRANT WORKERSSo, are Singaporeans willing to pay for the higher costs that will inevitably arise from offering migrant workers a better deal? The jury is still out, based on past experience, according to the experts interviewed. The empirical evidence suggests that the mindset of Singaporeans towards migrant workers has not changed, despite an outpouring of sympathy whenever a major incident occurred.At the IPS webinar, MWC executive director Bernard Menon lamented that despite past events such as the SMRT bus driver strike in 2012 and the Little India riot the following year, the momentum arising from the online discourses on worker welfare would eventually peter out.‚ÄúWe have a lot of people coming up and saying ‚Äòyou should improve this, you should improve that‚Äô,‚Äù said Mr Menon.‚ÄúBut unfortunately, though you can obviously tell that there‚Äôs been a gradual increase over time of interest and concern ‚Ä¶ this has lagged behind the expectations I‚Äôve had during these crises.‚Äù Most recently, in December last year, the International Labour Organization and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women jointly published a detailed study into society attitudes towards migrant labour in Japan, Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. The study included both work permit holders working in the construction industry and foreign domestic workers as part of their report.It found that overall support for migrant workers had decreased in the past nine years, when a similar study was conducted in 2010. ‚ÄúKnowledge regarding migrant workers across the four countries remains low, and discriminatory attitudes prevail with significant numbers of members of the public in migrant destination countries stating that migrant workers should not enjoy equal working conditions with nationals,‚Äù the report stated.The study found that 36 per cent of the 1,005 Singapore respondents believed migrant workers should not receive the same work conditions as local workers, or be entitled to join a union. Around 40 per cent said migrant workers who end up exploited only have themselves to blame, a majority - 60 per cent - disagree that migrant workers should receive the same pay and benefits as nationals, and 53 per cent said migrant workers threaten the country‚Äôs culture and heritage.Nevertheless, a majority of the Singaporean respondents (58 per cent) recognised that migrant workers had a net positive effect on Singapore‚Äôs national economy.A ROUND OF SOUL-SEARCHINGWith the pandemic forcing Singapore - as a collective - to pay the price for years of apparent neglect, commentators said that after COVID-19 is eliminated, Singapore needs to openly embark on some serious soul-searching.For a start, the society‚Äôs mindset and attitude towards migrant workers need to ‚Äúundergo a sea change‚Äù, said Associate Professor Eugene Tan from the Singapore Management University.‚ÄúSG United must include migrant workers from the get-go ... We cannot, as a society, seek to harness the benefits of their being here and yet not prepare to bear the costs of their being in our midst. We cannot continue to have the gains privatised but the costs socialised in our migrant worker policy,‚Äù the law don said.As Singapore figures out its next steps for migrant workers, the workers are also trying to figure out theirs as they mill around in their rooms within the various dormitories dotting Singapore keeping a distance from everyone else.The Big Read - foreign workers in Singapore 5Mr Syedur Rahman Liton and his friend Asit at a poetry event in Singapore in 2017.

And even if they were not informed, the elite ruling class that is amongst the most highly paid leaders in the world because they themselves say they need to be the most highly paid in order to attract the best talent, *that* ruling class ought to have known. 

Instead, we get a whole lot of waffling about how this was only foreseeable in hindsight. This is what Josephine Teo [said](-teams-in-place-at-all-43-dormitories-to-tackle-situation): 

> Replying to a reporter's question on whether anything could have been done to avoid having to quarantine thousands of workers, Mrs Teo said ""it is not as if we have not done anything"" to manage the situation in dormitories.

> She recalled how stay-home notices and entry approval for workers returning from China were implemented in January and February, with inspections to make sure they obeyed the rules.

> On the decision to quarantine workers, she said: ""Given the scale and the complexity of the operations, it was never going to be a trivial decision to implement these measures, where the evidence did not previously suggest they were necessary.""

Set aside the callous, defensive, don't-blame-me attitude behind ""it is not as if we have not done anything"". 

You know what the ""standard of evidence"" was, by end February? We strongly, strongly suspected that the covid virus spreads pre- and a-symptomatically. We *knew* that some people with the disease presented with very mild symptoms. We knew that foreign workers were impacted and were being discouraged from reporting sick, because there was a directive requiring doctors to issue 5-day mandatory MC for URTI symptoms, and if your MC entitlement runs out you don't get paid. This is even without considering the kind of pressure that companies put on foreign workers to exploit them further. 

Knowing all of this, what could we have done more? 

The PAP's answer is ""it is not as if we have not done anything"". 

I do not accept this standard of governance. 

I don't even care if the PAP does not apologise. Apologising is never about saying the words ""I'm sorry"". Apologising is about, step 1, acknowledging that you have done wrong. We can't even get past this hump because The PAP Does No Wrong. 

That's why you see emotive memes like ""there is no war in ba sing se"" and ""say sorry"". They all come from a place of genuine discomfort at how the PAP handles things. Look at [this thread](/), you can see where some of these objections are rooted.

> SINGAPORE - The Ministry of Health (MOH) has preliminarily confirmed 573 new Covid-19 cases as of Monday noon (May 4), taking the country's total count to 18,778.

> Among these are five Singaporeans and permanent residents, while migrant workers living in dormitories continue to make up the bulk of the remaining cases.

> More details will be released later on Monday, the ministry said.

> Over the weekend, the Government announced plans to ease some of the tighter restrictions put in place during Singapore's circuit breaker, but said that these measures - which were due to end on Monday - will continue for another week.

> Some businesses, such as barbers, home-based businesses and laundry services, will be allowed to progressively open from May 12, although they still have to abide by precautions put in place earlier. For instance, hairdressers can offer only haircuts.

> This comes as some governments across the world begin or mull over plans to ease curbs in order to restart their economies, amid concerns that such moves could backfire and cause spikes in virus cases.

> Portugal, for instance, ended its state of emergency over the weekend, while Spain is allowing restaurants to reopen for takeaways and adults to exercise on the streets.

> Singapore's Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong said on Saturday that the country has to adapt and adjust its solutions ""cautiously and gradually"".

> ""And as we do this, we need everyone to cooperate, so that we can open up the economy and resume normal activities safely without causing further clusters to form,"" he said at a multi-ministry task force briefing.

> There were 657 new coronavirus cases on Sunday.

> MOH said 15,833 of the 323,000 migrant workers living in dormitories - 4.9 per cent - have tested positive for the virus. In contrast, 569 migrant workers not living in dorms, as well as 1,224 Singaporeans and permanent residents, have been diagnosed with the virus.

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> The virus prevalence rates for migrant workers not living in dorms, and that for Singaporeans and permanent residents, are 1.09 per cent and 1.03 per cent respectively.

> MOH said on Sunday that new community cases among Singaporeans and PRs, as well as long-term pass and work pass holders, fell from an average of 21 daily cases two weeks ago to 11 in the past week. This excludes work permit holders who are not living in dormitories.

> The number of unlinked cases from this group has also dropped from a daily average of 13 to five over the same period.

> As of Sunday, 1,404 patients in Singapore have fully recovered from the virus and been discharged.

> Eighteen people have died from Covid-19 complications and four who tested positive have died from other causes.

> Globally, the outbreak, which began in December last year, has infected about 3.5 million people. About a quarter of a million people have died.

> The United States is the worst affected country in the world with more than 1.1 million cases and 66,000 deaths from Covid-19 as of Monday.

550,"> # Coronavirus: Mustafa Centre believed to be starting point for hundreds of cases

> Mustafa Centre is believed to have been the starting point for hundreds of coronavirus infections at foreign worker dormitories, said the Health Ministry's director of medical services Kenneth Mak yesterday.

> The workers are likely to have been infected after visiting the shopping mall, where some employees had fallen ill. They transmitted the infection to their co-workers, who then infected others at their dormitories.

> Preliminary investigations have linked the Mustafa Centre cluster to clusters at the construction site at Project Glory and five dormitories, Associate Professor Mak said.

> These are S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, Tampines Dormitory, Toh Guan Dormitory, Sungei Tengah Lodge and Cochrane Lodge II.

> The majority of yesterday's 287 new cases were linked to foreign worker dormitories.

> Thousands of healthy workers are being moved to locations such as army camps and floating hotels, and the Government has started to actively screen and test workers for the disease.

> Four dormitories have also been gazetted as isolation areas.

> At a press conference yesterday, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo was asked if anything could have been done to avoid having to quarantine thousands of foreign workers.

> In response, she said the Government had taken steps since the start of the outbreak to engage dormitory operators and break up large gatherings of foreign workers.

> Related Story Coronavirus: Sungei Tengah Lodge is 4th foreign worker dorm gazetted as isolation area

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> ""It is not as if we have not done anything to try and manage the situation at the dorms,"" Mrs Teo added, noting that there have been no clusters in dormitories until only recently, even though a number of foreign workers had tested positive for the virus.

> ""Within dorms, workers interact with each other very regularly, very closely - they're like family, so the risk of transmission was always there,"" she said.

> Preventing clusters at dormitories would have required drastic measures involving the closure of work sites and malls, and were not easy decisions to make when the evidence at that time did not suggest they were necessary, Mrs Teo said.

> ""We couldn't have so easily said: 'Well, let's do it', when there were no similar occurrences of the clusters that we see today,"" she added. ""It's not a button that you press easily, and it is a non-trivial decision to make.""

> National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said: ""If I had known, of course, I would have done things differently - but no one can tell the next step.

> ""The reality is no one will know... if one case can very quickly spread into a cluster.""

> At present, the Government's priority is to contain the spread in dormitories for foreign workers while ensuring that their welfare is looked after, he said.

> At yesterday's press conference, Mr Wong also stressed that the disease is not a ""foreign worker issue"" and that any individual can be a weak link if he does not comply with safe distancing measures.

> ""One lapse can result in a cluster forming, so all of us have to do our part to stabilise the situation and keep it under control,"" he said.

> ""We have a responsibility for these foreign workers who have come all the way here, at considerable expense, to make a living in Singapore. So we will do our part, and we will do our very best to take care of them, and ensure their safety and their well-being.""

573,"> # Coronavirus: Letter on dorm cases xenophobic, says Shanmugam

> A forum letter published in Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao that linked the Covid-19 outbreak in dormitories to foreign workers' personal hygiene and living habits showed racism and deep insensitivity, Home Affairs and Law Minister K. Shanmugam said yesterday.

> The letter, published on Tuesday, also showed a lack of understanding of why there has been Covid-19 transmission in Singapore's foreign worker population, he added.

> While the average number of cases in the local community has stayed stable in recent days, the number of cases in dormitories has soared to the hundreds and now forms the majority of new cases.

> This is primarily due to communal living and is not just a question of personal habits, Mr Shanmugam told Zaobao.

> ""Personal habits are extremely important: washing of hands, keeping yourself clean,"" he said.

> ""But when you put people together, when they sleep in the same room, they cook together and they are in close proximity over a long period of time, of course there will be high levels of transmission, just like we know (there are) also transmissions in households.""

> Instead of pointing fingers, Singaporeans should be coming together to take care of the foreign workers here, he added, as he credited them for helping to build Singapore's Housing Board flats and infrastructure and keeping the country clean.

> ""Our duty as Singaporeans, really, is to show them empathy and take care of them,"" he said. ""I don't think this is the time to say it is their own fault.""

> He noted the Singapore community has mobilised to help foreign workers here, while the Government has stepped in to ensure they continue to receive their salaries, medical care and daily meals.

> ""All of these gestures - I'm not sure that many other countries are doing it - are really to assure the foreign workers that they are not just locked down in their dorms and left there to fend for themselves without any idea of what's going to happen to them,"" he said.

> ""That's not the way.""

> In the letter, forum writer Lee Shiwan had asked if foreign workers should not themselves be held responsible for the outbreak in the dormitories, given that they ""like to gather and do not pay attention to personal hygiene"".

> Ms Lee had also said many foreign workers came from backward countries and brought with them ""habits such as eating with their hands and eating under trees"".

> Lianhe Zaobao said in a statement that its letters pages publish a diversity of views, and the opinions of contributors do not represent the newspaper's position.

> A day before publishing the letter, the newspaper ran stories about the conditions of foreign worker dormitories here and the need to include them in the battle against Covid-19, said Zaobao's forum editor Yap Pheng Hui.

> ""The intention of Zaobao in publishing the (letter) was to present a differing opinion so readers would be able to appreciate the diversity of viewpoints in society,"" he said.

> Mr Yap noted that most of the letters the newspaper has received to date were against the position taken by Ms Lee, and have ""provided well-reasoned rebuttals against the position put forth in the original article"". The original letter had thus allowed for robust debates and allowed ""a wider audience to reflect upon and understand the impact of the pandemic"".

> Related Story Rajinikath, Sachin Tendulkar share messages of encouragement for foreign workers in Singapore

> ""Zaobao believes that it is through the diverse mediums of readers' letters, opinion pieces and investigative pieces by journalists that our society draws ever closer to the truth,"" he said.

> Mr Shanmugam, who found the letter xenophobic, stressed it is possible for 57 per cent of Singaporeans to be professionals, managers, executives and technicians, or PMETs, because foreign workers form the base of the economy.

> They, therefore, help build Singapore's prosperity and should be better appreciated, he said.

581,"Basically, if FWs present respiratory pneumonia like symptoms, they would be deemed to have been clinically diagnosed to have COVID-19 and prolly treated symptomatically for it. But, as the news report on CNA had put it (on Saturday), this means that possibly hundred of such cases would have been left out because, being clinically diagnosed does not equal confirmed, hence these possibly infected cases would not be included in the daily tally of confirmed cases. It does not mean no more testing is done in the dorms, there're tests still being run, but if FWs have aforementioned symptoms of respiratory pneumonia, they are assumed to have COVID-19 and may be tested later as treatment comes first. I guess it's a way to simplify diagnosis and to assign treatment as priority, but it leaves out a large number of possible confirmed infections. Now, the issue whether this is done for sake of urgent treatment or expediency to outright masking the real number of infections per day, that's for you guys to decide.",1.0,2020-04-26 12:35:00,hardwarezone,basically fws present respiratory pneumonia like symptoms would deemed clinically diagnosed prolly treated symptomatically news report cna put saturday means possibly hundred would left clinically diagnosed not equal confirmed hence possibly infected would not included daily tally confirmed not mean no testing done tests still run fws aforementioned symptoms respiratory pneumonia assumed may tested later treatment comes first guess way simplify diagnosis assign treatment priority leaves large number possible confirmed infections issue whether done sake urgent treatment expediency outright masking real number infections per day guys decide,1.0

* PUQs in Government Quarantine Facility : 9184
* PUQs in Home Quarantine Order : 592

If your grandparents were ethnic Chinese born in Singapore, they almost certainly wrote in proper Chinese rather than PRC Simplified, and spoke Cantonese, Hokkien, or Teochew rather than Imperial Mandarin. When I read linguistics in uni, I read under a professor who started every single lecture (reportedly in his entire 40-plus-year career) with the declaration that

(Emphasis in the original.) I've often wondered if Professor McKinley had ever spent time in Singapore; the longer I'm here (first came in '79), the more firmly I'm convinced he was calling us out with his usual discretion- and tact-enabled plausible deniability.

699,"SINGAPORE -  A man found motionless at a staircase landing at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital on Thursday morning (April 23) later died from his injuries.Police said in a statement that they were alerted to a case of unnatural death at the hospital at around 7.30am.The man, an Indian national, 46, was found lying motionless at the staircase landing. He later died from his injuries.Based on preliminary investigations, the police said they do not suspect foul play. They are investigating the case.The Ministry of Health (MOH) confirmed that the man was a coronavirus patient.In a statement on Thursday evening, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said it is deeply saddened by the man's death. The man's family members and employer, as well as the Indian High Commission in Singapore, have been informed, said the MOM.The ministry said the man was a construction worker and had worked for the same employer since September 2009.""Background checks do not reveal any complaints against the employer,"" the ministry added.The man had lived in a factory-converted dormitory operated by the employer, which was last inspected on April 12.""At the time, it housed nine workers, including the deceased, less than the approved capacity for factory-converted dormitories. The dormitory was found to be in an acceptable condition, including cleanliness and ventilation,"" said the MOM.Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam and Manpower Minister Josephine Teo met the man's roommates at the dormitory.""The workers were sad but calm. They reported that they have been well taken care of by the employer,"" said MOM in its statement.The workers also requested that the man's nephew, who is also employed by the same company, be allowed to pay his last respects.The MOM said it is working with the MOH to facilitate the request.In a recorded video interview, Mrs Teo encouraged any workers who need help or have any feedback to approach the MOM.""We want to assure the workers once again that we are here to help them, and if there's anything at all, they can reach out to our officers. They have the numbers, and they know how to contact us,"" she said.""This is a difficult time for all of them. We appreciate all of their contributions to Singapore and we are committed to looking after them. So whatever it is that they need, as long as they reach out to us, we will provide the support to them.""Mrs Teo also said that ""we have assured (the workers) that they will be taken care of and we will help them to recover, and they should not hesitate to step forward to seek medical attention"".""We¬íve also assured them that we will work with their employers to ensure that they continue to be paid their salaries and that they can send money home to provide for their families,"" she said.On the death of the Indian worker, Mr Shanmugam said in Tamil in a recorded video interview that the police are investigating what happened, why it happened and whether the man had other medical issues.The ministry is also working with the Hindu Endowments Board to undertake the necessary funeral arrangements for the man, as well as the Migrant Workers' Centre to provide support to his family.-of-khoo-teck",1.0,2020-04-23 22:10:00,hardwarezone,singapore man found motionless staircase landing khoo teck puat hospital thursday morning april 23 later died injuries police said statement alerted case unnatural death hospital around 7 30am man indian national 46 found lying motionless staircase landing later died injuries based preliminary investigations police said not suspect foul play investigating case ministry health moh confirmed man patient statement thursday evening ministry manpower mom said deeply saddened man death man family members employer well indian high commission singapore informed said mom ministry said man construction worked employer since september 2009 background checks not reveal complaints against employer ministry added man lived factory converted operated employer last inspected april 12 time housed nine including deceased less approved capacity factory converted found acceptable condition including cleanliness ventilation said mom home affairs minister k shanmugam manpower minister josephine teo met man roommates sad calm reported well taken care employer said mom statement also requested man nephew also employed company allowed pay last respects mom said working moh facilitate request recorded video interview mrs teo encouraged need help feedback approach mom want assure help anything reach officers numbers know contact us said difficult time appreciate contributions singapore committed looking whatever need long reach us provide support mrs teo also said assured taken care help recover should not hesitate step forward seek medical attention also assured work employers ensure continue paid salaries send money home provide families said death indian mr shanmugam said tamil recorded video interview police investigating happened happened whether man medical issues ministry also working hindu endowments board undertake necessary funeral arrangements man well centre provide support family khoo teck,1.0

716,"I'm not sure if your view of it being filthy should be generalised. My experience is based on rooms that have always been occupied and dormitories that have existed for quite some time. In fact, I have even been to westlite dormitory at toh guan where it's currently a cluster. The whole bunk including kitchen, ""living room"" and bed room is slightly smaller than others that I have been to but ventilation is still not a problem. Again, I reiterate my same points: there are rooms which are dirty but there are also rooms that are clean in that dormitory. I strongly believe it is the role of the occupants in the room to maintain the cleanliness of the room.

Regarding the amenities, most dormitories are located in areas that are ulu and closer to industrial estates. This means that they lack leisure facilities which are usually located in neighbourhood estates. As a result, most dormitories cater these facilities for their occupants within the dormitory itself. For westlite at tohguan, you can check it out here "" -toh-guan/"".

Security guards may patrol the facility but I do not believe residents are checked. In order to enter the building itself, you must have a specialised card or something and it only allows entry if you are a resident so that may record their enter and exit timings but how does it affect occupants? Occupants of a room then have another physical key just for their room so there is no enter and exit timings for their room if that is what you are implying. 

The curfew and movement restrictions at night is intended to keep the noise level down in the facility and prevent gatherings in the middle of the night. In the dormitory itself not all workers work 8-5. There are workers who work different shifts and in the same room, meaning there may be workers working am shift while the other half work pm shift. With the curfew and movement restriction, i believe that is their true intention so that there is no unnecessary disturbance to other residents.

In actuality it's not a detention centre. It's a specific type of housing unit meant for temporary and not long term occupants. Yes their living accommodations are paid for by companies hiring them but it's not free. It seems free but it's deducted from the company's budget that is one of the reasons why their salary is lower as compared to a local.",1.0,2020-04-08 11:23:17,reddit,not sure view filthy should generalised experience based rooms always occupied existed quite time fact even westlite toh guan currently cluster whole bunk including kitchen living room bed room slightly smaller others ventilation still not problem reiterate points rooms dirty also rooms clean strongly believe role occupants room maintain cleanliness room regarding amenities located areas ulu closer industrial estates means lack leisure facilities usually located neighbourhood estates result cater facilities occupants within westlite tohguan check toh guan security guards may patrol facility not believe residents checked order enter building must specialised card something allows entry resident may record enter exit timings affect occupants occupants room another physical key room no enter exit timings room implying curfew movement restrictions night intended keep noise level facility prevent gatherings middle night not work 8 5 work different shifts room meaning may working shift half work pm shift curfew movement restriction believe true intention no unnecessary disturbance residents actuality not detention centre specific type housing unit meant temporary not long term occupants yes living accommodations paid companies hiring not free seems free deducted company budget one reasons salary lower compared local,1.0

BBT shops tend to be tiny without much space to manoeuvre, and most do not have tables & chairs at all for dining in prior to the CB. If there's a queue, consumers plus delivery folks end up congregating in a group for the more popular outlets.

For those coffee outlets, with the lack of office workers nowadays I think their demand has went down. Even if they had more customers, there is likely space in their shops for them to do their waiting.

When I actually went to Toa Payoh Central once during the pre-tightened CB at 3pm (I'd assume this is not peak period), it was quite crazy looking at the stretch of 3 BBT shops in close proximity.

Regarding lockdown extensions, on one hand it makes sense that the govt probably wants a period (likely a week) where there are no cases. That's the SG style of management as far as I've seen. However, that doesn't mean we should approve of it, and I understand where you are coming from. It looks to me that as always, the govt is ready to make ""economic sacrifices"" at the cost of smaller businesses, in exchange for a more ""safe"" end of lockdown.

Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet.

As for the rising ""foreign workers"" clusters, I never saw it as, ""no community spread"" situation until I read the malicious comments on fb and here. 

It is iffy. How our workers are treated have been iffy for YEARS. No one cared. The government never batted an eye. The million dollar companies that house these poorly paid workers didn't care.

>  
>There is an increase today in the number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside dormitories. **The vast majority of these cases are workers in the construction sector serving their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) requirements.**¬† 

There are construction workers who live outside dorms. Note that non-Malaysian construction workers are not allowed to rent HDBs. But construction workers can be housed in temporary quarters near/in construction sites, and in private housing (typically run-down units above shophouses). Some may also be housed illegally in warehouses and commercial buildings that aren't official factory-converted dorms. I personally think that MOH is being kind of evasive about this because some of the non-dorm WP cases were being housed illegally and they don't want to air even more dirty laundry.

990,"Wife of grassroots leader in workers‚Äô dorm business, shows their Sentosa weekend ‚Äúparty home‚Äù to mediaIt was earlier reported that as of Wed (8 Apr) this week, active COVID-19 clusters have been found at 9 different foreign worker dormitories in Singapore.A few of the 9 are operated by companies linked to grassroots leaders of People‚Äôs Association (PA). The top 2 foreign worker dormitories with the most number of confirmed COVID-19 cases as of yesterday (10 Apr) were S11 Dormitory (306 cases) and Westlite Toh Guan (69 cases). Both have been gazetted by the government as isolation areas under the Infectious Diseases Act.In particular, Westlite Toh Guan is run by public listed company Centurion Corporation Ltd, helmed by two PA grassroots leaders who are ‚Äújoint chairmen‚Äù of the company: David Loh Kim Kang and Han Seng Juan. Han was awarded PBM in 2010 and BBM in 2015, while Loh got his PBM in 2011 and BBM in 2016.They were both given public service medals for ‚Äúhelping‚Äù out at Potong Pasir SMC under MP Sitoh Yih Pin. In the general election of 2011, PAP managed to wrestle back Potong Pasir from opposition and it‚Äôs now under PAP.Another board member of Centurion Corporation, Rajah & Tann‚Äôs lawyer Chandra Mohan, is also a grassroots leader awarded with PBM and BBM in recognition of his contribution towards community services in Northwest Community Development Council (NWCDC).Han‚Äôs Sentosa Cove weekend party home has rooms inspired by four seasonsFurther checks online revealed that socialite Susanna Kang is married to Han. In fact, 4 years ago, Mrs Han opened up their weekend ‚Äúparty home‚Äù at Sentosa Cove for reporters to take a look (‚ÄòChic abodes: Two stylish women open up their homes‚Äò).Mrs Han is said to be a ‚Äúfixture in society magazines‚Äù, often seen wearing head-turning gowns and ensembles, complete with elaborate hairstyles.At the Hans‚Äô Sentosa Cove weekend home, the ST reporter noted the ‚Äúcreative streak‚Äù in its design. ‚ÄúStanding on a 9,000 sq ft plot of land, the expansive house is a weekend home and features rooms inspired by the four seasons,‚Äù the reporter wrote. ‚ÄúIt is here that the family entertain friends and host dinners for close business partners about once a month, with as many as 100 people gathering at what has come to be known as the Party House.‚ÄùApparently, Mrs Han wanted a house that has the ‚Äúwow factor‚Äù for the purpose of entertaining guests. It was built in 2012. A ‚Äúcurtain‚Äù weighing more than 2,721kg imported from Germany and made of high-grade stainless steel cloaks the perimeter of the second floor. It can be pulled back to get an unblocked beautiful view of the sea.When guests arrive at the four-storey house, they descend a long flight of stairs into a cavernous basement. Mrs Han said, ‚ÄúI meant for it to be like a runway, where guests can sashay and strut their stuff down the stairs. It‚Äôs also the perfect spot to see the rest of the house. As you look up from the stairs, you get a good look at what else there is to explore.‚ÄùThe basement is filled with futuristic-looking furniture from well-known brands and designers such as Italian label Moroso and renowned architect Zaha Hadid. An Hermes screen, made of a wood frame and scraps of crocodile skin taken from the cutting-room floor at the French luxury house‚Äôs atelier, adds a luxurious touch. A luscious green wall, filled with creepers growing under ultraviolet light, is encased behind a misty glass screen, creating a tropical spring feel for the basement. Adding to that wild factor are two taxidermied peacocks that preen regally next to the bar.The dining room has a 22-seat custom-made table with bronzed legs and a high-gloss finish ‚Äì the result of multiple layers of lacquer. It beautifully reflects American industrial designer Karim Rashid‚Äôs topograph-shaped chandelier that was made as part of Swarovski‚Äôs Crystal Palace collection.The upper floors were designed for smaller break-out groups for relaxation especially after a nice dinner. On second level there are 3 rooms: One is a karaoke and media room, complete with decor of KTV lounges for the ‚Äúfeel of the real thing‚Äù, said Mrs Han. Another has a masculine vibe with a dark brown sofa by Italian furniture-maker Poltrona Frau and a well-stocked wine chiller. Here, the men can kick back and relax with cigars, while talking business, politics or any other matters. The third room simulates a chic ski resort cabin. Mrs Han has the air-conditioning ducts trained on this area so that the blast of cold air creates that icy feeling. The floor is covered in a fluffy, white carpet and there is a fireplace that runs on ethanol. It produces flames, but not heat.For parties around the pool, guests head to the summer room in the attic that is designed to look like a ship‚Äôs cabin. Sofa beds face the infinity pool outside. For movie nights, a hidden projector comes down and guests can kick back or sleep over if they want to and wake up to a sea view. ‚ÄúI get my respite here. It‚Äôs quite peaceful looking at the blue, open sea,‚Äù she said.She described her Sentosa home as a ‚Äúmodern kelong‚Äù as it is surrounded by water but the family does not live there. Their family home is a good-class bungalow in Bukit Timah.(Pictures of the Hans‚Äô Sentosa Cove weekend home from ST Photo):Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) warns about crammed condition in foreign worker dormitoriesMeanwhile, non-profit organization Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) has been warning about the crammed conditions in foreign worker dormitories being highly conducive to spread the coronavirus (‚ÄòForum: Employers‚Äô practices leave foreign workers vulnerable to infection‚Äò, 23 Mar).Writing to ST Forum on 23 Mar, TWC2 said, ‚ÄúCurrently, foreign workers are housed 12 to 20 men per room in double-decker beds. They are transported to work on the back of lorries sitting shoulder to shoulder. Neither of these conditions conforms with social distancing. The risk of a new cluster among this group remains undeniable,‚ÄùTWC2 warned and advocated that new dormitory should require more space per head and no more than four persons to a room.On TWC2 website, it shows a picture of how crammed the condition is at a dormitory (Westlite Mandai) run by Han‚Äôs company.Indeed, about a week later after TWC2 wrote to ST to warn everyone, clusters of COVID-19 started breaking out in different foreign worker dormitories.Perhaps Han should ask his wife to use her ‚Äúcreative streak‚Äù to also help design the Centurion‚Äôs foreign worker dormitories so that the workers can have less crammed spaces to live in?
