24,">**On Testing and COVID numbers**
 
>But, before we go to the second part of this COVID saga, let’s take a brief intermission and talk about COVID numbers. I think that it’s v important for our students to learn about how to look at numbers and make sense of numbers. We have a Quantitative Reasoning (QR) module at NUS. I hope the instructors covered this example in class already. 
 
>First, the numbers are all wrong. It was obvious that the numbers coming out of China were all wrong. China was accused of under-reporting and lying about the seriousness of the situation. In fact, the chart coming out of China was surprisingly linear. Confirm fake lah!
 
>Let me tell you this. If we look at the numbers coming out of the US, I can tell you almost certainty that the numbers are also under-reported. Confirm wrong. US also under-reporting and lying about their numbers? 
 
>So, what’s the moral of the story? Everybody lies? 
 
>As it turns out, there one big choke point that few people have talked about -- that’s testing. This COVID test is not some pregnancy test. You don’t happily go out to Watsons and buy one. Good for Korea for nailing this and really ramping up the tests. But most countries struggle, including us. 
 
>There are limits to how many tests can be conducted and processed. In fact, when we say that linear looking thing coming out of China, we were likely seeing the testing capacity rather than the actual number of cases. 
 
>So how do we make sense out of this lack of data? We look at the death rates. We take the country with the lowest death rate. I suspect it’s Singapore, but people can check. We’re at 1.075%. Basically out of every 10,000 infected, about 8 die. 
 
>Let’s look at the US. They claim to have 1.65 million cases. They currently have a death rate 6%. That’s a hundred times higher than Singapore(!).
 
>While we might believe that we have a better healthcare system in Singapore. Do we believe that we are 100x better? Not possible, so what we can do is to conservatively assume that their healthcare systems are overwhelmed and 2 to 3 times worse, so it might be reasonable to assume that their actual effective death rate should be say 1.2%. 
 
>What this suggests is that the situation in the US could potentially be 30x worse that what is officially reported. With the same approach, I had estimated the total number of cases in Wuhan was likely in the 300,000 range, when it was reported to be ~60,000. 
 
>The reader is encouraged to apply this simple methodology to get a sense of how bad things are in other countries. Generally, it’s probably /*much/* worse than what’s reported.

>**How and Why did Sh*t Hit the Fan?**
 
>It was all fine and dandy. We were all having our bubble tea, as the world went into chaos. Then what happened?
 
>The methodology I used above is not rocket science. It would also be obvious to the MTF that things were rapidly going south overseas. What did we do? 
 
>We activated MFA and started evacuating our people from overseas. All our students on exchanged were recalled. Many were complaining. 
 
>As it turned out, many of these returnees were infected and we were not able to control the second wave, leading to the Circuit Breaker. 
 
>Was it a mistake to evacuate them? 
 
>I am glad that nobody suggested that we made a mistake in recalling our citizens. My view: We had no choice. We need to take care of our own. 
 
>The bigger problem obviously are the foreign worker dorms. I am surprised that Dr Tan did not say anything about this and we went on and on this usual meaningless tirade against the Government that nobody probably cares to read. Nevermind, I do the job for him. 
 
>Let’s talk about the foreign worker dorms.
 
>We have always had these NGOs, activists, dunno what, clamoring about improving conditions in the dorms, whatever lah. Generally, my impression was that we just have bunch of bleeding hearts trying to do. Good for them. Good for us. I mind my own business.
 
>However, we now have this on-going narrative, that Government was completely at fault. If only the Government had listened to them and improved the conditions for the dorms, we wouldn’t have these massive numbers of infections in the dorms. 
 
>How many people believe this? Hands up. 
 
>Very good. Put your hand down. 
 
>Boys and girls, let talk about how to reason about this claim.
 
>Suppose the Government has just listened to these NGOs. Every single one of these foreigner workers had their own single rooms with attached bathroom and sauna. Best in Singapore and Batam also. We throw in a cleaning auntie to do area cleaning for them and do their laundry. Just imagine that. 
 
>Do we believe that it would have allowed us to avoid the current problem with the foreign worker dorms? 
 
>Obviously, this would increase social distancing and *maybe* help somewhat. But guess what? The workers will still be eating together and working together. Do people understand how infectious this virus is? Even healthcare workers in full PPE can still catch it. Confirm will still kenna. Who are we kidding?
 
>Keep in mind that we would not be requiring them to wear masks -- because our own people were not asked to wear masks then. You want to discriminate against these foreign workers? 
 
>My point: all these claims that acceding to the earlier demands of these NGOs and activists would have allowed us to avoid the current foreigner worker COVID situation is hogwash. Plain and simple. 
 
>Why are we misled into thinking that it would help? Because our brains are lazy. We want easy solutions. Part of it is also the Government’s fault. The Government didn’t offer us any reason for how and why the situation imploded in the dorm. Given the lack of an alternative, people just accept what is offered, hook, line and sinker. 
 
>I think it’s despicable for these groups to try to use this crisis to advance their lobbying. This is not the time. People also please don’t repeat stupid sh*t that you hear just because people say them. Use your brain to think about whether it makes sense. 

>There is a bunch of geniuses who say that if only we didn’t have any foreigner workers, there would not be any dorms and so there would be no foreign worker dorm problem. That statement is actually completely true. I shall leave it as an exercise for the reader to analyze the feasibility and helpfulness of that suggestion. 
 
>**Root Cause of Foreign Dorm Infections**
 
>Keep in mind that we actually did have one foreign worker dorm incident even in the first wave. That was settled with military precision. People think about it. You might know that the foreign worker dorms are a risk, but if you get a case and it was handled quite easily, you would naturally think that the risk was manageable. 
 
>My hypothesis is that the real root cause for the foreign dorm infections was the humongous number of asymptomatic cases. To be fair, we always had this suspicion that there could be a small number of asymptomatic carriers. That the proportion could be up to 96(!)% was not apparent until after we had imposed the CB. By then, it was too late. 
 
>Why is it so hard for us and anyone to detect this earlier? Well, for the simple reason that there was a limited testing capacity. 
 
>If you had to choose who to test, would you choose the ones who look sick or the ones who look perfectly normal. This massive problem was likely detected when one dorm got hit and they did systematic testing in the dorms.
 
>Maybe some people expect a Government that is more omniscient. They certainly have the option to vote in a more omniscient Government at the next GE. Our Tans seem to be pretty omniscient.  :-)

Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet.

92,"A forum letter published in Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao that links the COVID-19 outbreak in dormitories to the personal hygiene and living habits of foreign workers shows ""underlying racism"", Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said.""I think the letter reveals some underlying racism ... Because it typecasts an entire group - several hundred thousand of them - as lacking in personal hygiene, on the basis of their background, because they all come from backward countries,"" he said in an interview with Lianhe Zaobao on Friday (Apr 17).Mr Shanmugam also said that the letter is xenophobic and deeply insensitive, and reflected a ""lack of understanding of why we have this transmission of COVID-19 amongst our foreign worker population"".Singapore has seen a spike in its number of COVID-19 cases in recent weeks, with the majority of new cases involving foreign workers from dormitories.On Friday, Singapore reported 623 new infections, of which 558 were linked to foreign worker dormitories.Kranji Lodge 1 on Saturday became the 13th foreign worker dormitory to be gazetted an isolation area, meaning residents will have to be quarantined in their rooms.To date, more than 3,200 of Singapore's 5,050 cases are attributed to foreign worker domitories.The forum letter, published on Apr 13, questioned if foreign workers were to be blamed for the rise in cases, pointing to their eating habits and alleged lack of personal hygiene.Mr Shanmugam, however, said that the number of cases at foreign worker dormitories were primarily due to communal living, pointing out that foreign workers live, work and cook together.""Personal habits are extremely important  washing of hands, keeping yourself clean are very important,"" he said.""But when you put people together, when they sleep in the same room, they cook together and they are in close proximity over a long period of time, of course there will be high levels of transmission.""Mr Shanmugam also acknowledged concerns over the living conditions in dormitories, saying that conditions in the newer dormitories were ""quite okay"", while standards in the older ones varied.""As (Manpower) Minister Josephine Teo has said, look, we will fix this up after COVID-19, and we will deal with the older dorms,"" he said.With foreign worker cases expected to continue rising amid aggressive testing, Mr Shanmugam said there is a need to educate people on the reasons.""The circulation is limited, they are in community isolation,"" he said.""The cross-infection from that person to the rest of the community, whether Singaporean or PR, or foreign worker, is extremely minimised through our isolation approaches.""Some people have also expressed concern that foreign domestic workers, because of potential interaction with foreign workers on their days off, could be another group at risk of being infected in large numbers.Current data shows that infection among foreign domestic workers is very low, said Mr Shanmugam.Foreign domestic workers have to comply with circuit breaker measures and must remain in their employers' homes on their rest days.""The evidence so far is that they get the infection from their employers, not from outside,"" he added.Looking at the bigger picture, Mr Shanmugam said Singaporeans have a duty to care for foreign workers and show them empathy, adding that the Government and community have moved to help them.Fifty-seven per cent of Singaporeans have been able to become professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMET) because of foreign workers, he said.""They clean Singapore, they build our HDB flats, they build our buildings, they handle our waste management, they form the base of our economy,"" he added.""And therefore they are helping us build our prosperity.""Mr Shanmugam cautioned Singaporeans against making sweeping statements about foreign workers, even as he acknowledged that racial fault lines run deep.""As Singaporeans, I would say, whether Chinese, Indian or Malay, or Eurasians, others, we are really kind, compassionate, generous people,"" he stated.""We are bigger than the sentiments expressed in that letter.""-12654924Why no story about throwing away food?",0,2020-04-18 13:10:00,hardwarezone,forum letter published

102,"Came here to say, this will not help and it’s such a terrible decision.  
  
I know our Frontlines in charge of Covid containment is overwhelmed with work but this has to be said:  

**Edit: ignore the first 3 points. Cruise for recovered FW.**  
1.They will do swap test first on those being relocated to these cruise- **but tests are known to have turn out negative initially** so they can still be infected.
   
2.These FW aren’t fully quarantined, **they are still going to work**.  
(Another concern, are we asking FW to continue wearing mask throughout work? again, if not then it’ll obviously be more likely to spread Covid. Perhaps their work already requires them to wear a mask idk.. I’ll just point this out so anyone in the know can work it out so no FW faints doing  labour work because of a suffocating mask whole day.)
   
3. Bad publicity worldwide. Once an outbreak occurs on this cruise(unless it’s contained very well, which is just betting ur luck.)
   
4. We should be applying lockdown for all FW living in crowded/shared dorm for at least 14days to make sure our healthcare doesn’t get strained more.
   
5. Imo, It makes no sense to let our FW continue work during this CB and Dormitory spike. We should solve the crowded dorm issues first, since we currently have community spread going on we shouldn’t react as if FW bringing Covid back to temporary dorm or causing further spread in community isn’t likely. 
   
My suggestion: I don’t know the capacity our country can do to house as many of them separately. But if surveillance is an issue, we can make mid shift shelters and get general public to help monitor via camera(we report to authorities if anyone try to sneak out) hopefully this will help slow the spread and we can get some breather for our frontlines.  
(For the sake of everyone, We will have to endure and work together if rubbish and cleaning or other essentials done by FW is disrupted.)
   
Before *you* start flaming aimlessly. Lockdown and surveillance means, **temporary** build a fenced shelter/tents for few weeks so the dormitory issues doesn’t turn tragic(we will only monitor the fences to make sure no one flout).

Edit: just realised it was for recovered FW, heard on TV and saw the comments hence I didn’t check the article first sorry. But some of my points can be considered.

This is confusing though: 
>The STB said: ""If activated, every effort will be made to uphold the health, welfare and security of foreign workers on board the ship, where they will be expected to observe the highest standards of safe distancing at all times.""

Three of the latest cases announced are imported. 314 cases have been discharged from acute care, and 705 cases have been moved to a community isolation facility, the task force said. Singapore has also seen six fatalities from COVID-19, the task force said. It was reported on Wednesday a 32-year-old Indian national died after taking a swab test, and was confirmed to have COVID-19 after his death.READ: Day 2 of COVID-19 'circuit breaker' sees more than 3,000 breaches of safe distancing measuresAdvertisementThe task force said that with the help of the police and Ministry of Defence, it established a link between the  cluster at Mustafa Centre shopping mall and the Project Glory construction site as well as a number of foreign worker dormitories: S11 Dormitory@Punggol, Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tampines Dormitory Cochrane Lodge II  and Toh Guan Dormitory. Director of medical services at the Ministry of Health Assoc Prof Kenneth Mak described how some of the dormitory cases were linked to the Mustafa Centre cluster.""We believe that the workers had visited Mustafa and they subsequently transmitted the infection to their co-workers,"" he said.  ""Transmission most likely occurred through close contact,for example at meal times, during breaks, and also between co-workers at work due to physical proximity at work sites,"" he said.Subsequently, they could have spread the infection to colleagues and friends within the dormitories, he added. Singapore has seen a rise of COVID-19 cases at foreign worker domitories recently.Sungei Tengah Lodge became the fourth foreign worker dormitory to become an isolation area from midnight on Thursday, in a move aimed at preventing the spread of the disease.The other three dormitores that have been gazetted as isolation areas are: S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, Westlite Toh Guan dormitory and Toh Guan Dormitory.READ: COVID-19: Sungei Tengah Lodge declared an isolation area under Infectious Diseases ActOn Thursday, the Land Transport Authority announced additional measures to ensure social distancing on public transport networks to help curb the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore.This includes thermal scanners at select MRT stations and safe distancing stickers on buses, trains, train stations, bus interchanges and bus stops.READ: COVID-19: Additional safe distancing measures implemented on public transportThis came after heightened safe distancing measures kicked in on Tuesday as part of a ""circuit breaker"" period until May 4 to stem the spread of COVID-19.About 10,000 written advisories were issued on the first two days of the circuit breaker for breaches, including individuals who gathered in public and those who failed to adhere to safe distancing rules.People who repeatedly flout the stricter safe-distancing measures will face a fine or be charged in court, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources Masagos Zulkifli wrote on Facebook on Thursday.First-time offenders will get a stern written warning.

156,"> # COVID-19: Singapore confirms 533 new cases, total at 32,876

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 533 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Wednesday (27 May) noon, bringing the total to 32,876.

> Of them, the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories, said the ministry, while three remaining cases are Singaporeans or permanent residents.

> It added that more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of over 2,500 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tuas View Dormitory and Jurong Penjuru Dormitory.

> They are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some 400,000 foreign workers live in dorms here in Singapore.

> Some 20,000 infected foreign workers are expected to be discharged by the end of this month, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong at a press conference on 12 May.

> This story will be updated later.

> MOH’S STATEMENT IN FULL

> With 706 more cases of COVID-19 infection discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, a total of 16,444 cases here have fully recovered from the infection, said the MOH on Tuesday.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while eight are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Apart from 23 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, nine others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and two whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> It had also noted that 86 male foreign workers aged 25 to 59 died due to heart disease in Singapore in 2018.

> As of 25 May, the ministry has conducted 334,691 swab tests, of which 218,996 were done on unique individuals.

> This translates to around 58,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 38,400 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

The place where I can see fines being imposed are just that, and failure to upkeep hygiene standards by supervisors. I've heard about electrical issues as well. HUGE FINES like people are hoping for probably won't happen.

If it all adds up it might be substantial, but nothing big enough to invoke waves of change. Stricter supervision will become a thing, but I doubt they will suddenly be living in better homes. While living conditions were not stellar, they were livable. There were no major issues prior to Covid. So the majority of this outrage is stemming from *distancing issues.*

In case the economics have failed the majority of Reddit, the biggest problem that plagued most people in Singapore financially is housing, before this Covid crisis. This is a problem of landspace. 100 HDB flats isn't suddenly going to appear out of no where, and 6 fully grown adults in one flat isn't exactly a huge step up. The biggest improvements here will be not having to bath with everyone. But that doesn't solve much does it? We would need 200-300 HDB flats to really allow safe distancing permanently. That's 200-300 high rise 40 floors hdb. 

Anyone has any idea where you wanna build 100-300 high rise HDB in Singapore to solve safe distancing for foreign workers permanently? Do the math yourself, there are roughly 300k foreign construction workers in Singapore at any one time. 

Or, you know, we could make foreign workers live in coffin homes like in Hong Kong. Way more inhuman IMO, but hey, safe distancing and privacy won't be an issue there. Perfect for dealing with covid, agreed?

If anyone of you can solve these issues, and compile the math and financial budget required for any minister to undertake this task, be my guest. I'd love to see these workers living in good condition too. But personally I think it's a more concrete issue of budget than a philosophical issue of discrimination and lack of care.",2,2020-04-14 06:27:50,reddit,basically bmt army couple not bunk beds room depending room size shared living area living inhuman conditions doubt fined except safe distancing law applies supervisors place see fines imposed failure upkeep hygiene standards supervisors heard electrical issues well huge fines like people hoping probably won happen adds might substantial nothing big enough invoke waves change stricter supervision become thing doubt suddenly living better homes living conditions not stellar livable no major issues prior majority outrage stemming distancing issues case economics failed majority reddit biggest problem plagued people singapore financially housing crisis problem landspace 100 hdb flats suddenly going appear no 6 fully grown adults one flat exactly huge step biggest improvements not bath everyone doesn solve much would need 200 300 hdb flats really allow safe distancing permanently 200 300 high rise 40 floors hdb anyone idea wanna build 100 300 high rise hdb singapore solve safe distancing permanently math roughly 300k construction singapore one time know could make live coffin homes like hong kong way inhuman imo hey safe distancing privacy won issue perfect dealing agreed anyone solve issues compile math financial budget required minister undertake task guest love see living good condition personally think concrete issue budget philosophical issue discrimination lack care

Edit 2: from my reply below:

> the recently abandoned precinct near my place due to en bloc is now being refitted with many new facilities, with rumors that it will be a quarantine/SHN center. There’s absolutely no news about that, but residents are seeing the work done and the urgency of speed that it’s done at, it’s not hard to put two and two together.  

Well, the notice just came up today, the blocks were being refitted with basic amenities like lighting and bedding, and it’s to house the foreign workers from the dorms so that they won’t be so cramped up together. They’ve been physically working at this for at least 2 weeks, you can only imagine the logistics and planning that needed to make this happen to go further back beyond that. 

See? I told you, they government _was_ doing something but as usual they do it quietly and don’t announce it until things are more or less underway - it’s their usual practice but as usual we only react to what we know because it’s soooo much easier to stand from where we are after everything has happened and criticize every single bit they’ve done than try to understand their plans. 

Edit: Okay, I get it. The signs have been there. But in crisis mode, to the benefit of the govt there’s many other areas they need to look at too. It wouldn’t be fair to say the government didn’t do anything when they have been doing everything they can for the whole country.

354,"> # Coronavirus: 21 vacant HDB blocks in Bukit Merah being refurbished to house essential foreign workers

> SINGAPORE - Some 21 vacant Housing Board blocks in Bukit Merah are being refurbished to house healthy foreign workers working in essential services, the Ministry of National Development (MND) has said.

> The workers will start to move into the three-room flats progressively as works are completed in the coming weeks.

> MND said in response to queries from The Straits Times on Wednesday (April 8) that the affected blocks had earlier undergone the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme, which buys back from residents public housing sitting on land with high redevelopment potential for other purposes.

> The flats were vacated in 2018 but not yet demolished.

> With foreign dormitories becoming a source of concern for the spread of the coronavirus in recent days, an inter-agency task force has been set up to, among other things, ensure that any disruption to essential services is minimised by having workers in these industries housed separately.

> The foreign workers who are expected to move into the Redhill Close flats work in areas such as cleaning and maintenance.

> In a notice to residents in the area on Monday, Minister of State for Social and Family Development Sam Tan said that the dormitories of the workers slated to move in have not been spared from Covid-19.

> Housing them separately will ""keep them safe from the disease, which will in turn keep us safe when they are working in our midst"", said Mr Tan, who is also Minister of State for Foreign Affairs.

> He also assured residents that just like the rest of Singapore during the ""circuit breaker"" measures, which began on Tuesday, the workers will remain in their flats except to travel to work using company transport or to buy essentials.

> Police and Certis officers will be deployed to maintain order at these blocks.

> ""Let's show our support to these workers by welcoming them during this difficult period,"" he added.

> The Straits Times has contacted MND for more information.

377,"In my original post, the point was giving them more space per room in a realistic scenario, which should be done by the way, *would not have prevented a dormitory cluster.*

Your point here is army dorm is more livable compared to fw dormitory. I cannot dispute this, you seem to know more details about the condition. I never said my post was infallible. So let's take this as it is. We reduce 1/5 men from every room that's really cramped and expand the dormitory. It's a realistic scenario. Fuck cost cutting. 
We can make it more livable.

Everyone gets more breathable living space.

Would that have changed anything about covid outbreak?

Maybe instead of averaging 1000 we'd get about 800~. Given that they would still share the same eating/cleaning space regardless I wonder how true that would be. I don't have expertise on the exact math of spread to build a model here.

There were no realistic scenario where we are able to give them enough privacy per person to prevent an outbreak. 

TL;DR this isn't exactly the right or wrong conversation for my post. People are mistaken about something, if they want better living conditions for FW, sure. I stand by the point it's not inhumane living condition, but it's also not ideal. 

If they are using covid as an argument for better living conditions, no, it would not have prevented dormitory clusters on the whole.

If you want to push the agenda for better living condition with the argument of minimizing the impact of covid outbreak though, I got nothing, full steam ahead. This was a compromise I left open in my original argument that no one took up because they were too busy trying to pin the entire FW dormitory outbreak on the corporations.

IMO the people who disagreed with my previous post were idealistic pussies who can't come up with a compromise themselves anyway. I have nothing against actual solutions. When you want to submit proposal of any kind in the working world you need concrete research. 

I personally have nothing against wanting better living conditions contrary to what my post might seem like on the first glance.

394,"At some point, the health ministry will stop moving out those who test positive, based on the educated suspicion that there will be more infected people than not. That's only simply because there is no manpower nor space to monitor tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands of sick people.

To always keep things in context, covid is a very mild illness in the vast majority of people. We're experiencing manpower shortfalls in healthcare because of the (very justified) policy in isolating every person who tests positive - this is a vast manpower undertaking. But at some point - this policy will prove a logistical impossibility and will therefore be stopped. Anyone who falls very ill can then be transported to a healthcare facility, but otherwise, sick people will largely be left to their own devices.

With regard to long-term policies? A fact-finding committee should be set in place with the power to issue criminal charges. There must be an investigation into the practices of these dormitory operators, the actions (or lack thereof) of the political leadership, and if there has been undue influence of these shady businesses in the workings of our government. But that's not going to happen, of course.

The political leadership for too long has dallied on much-belated policies - it has been sitting on its arse for far too long leeching on the high-level of competence of the state bureaucracy. It's long-past time for them to tell local businesses to front up or shut up and stop crying about 'manpower shortages' because they don't want to pay living wages or invest in productivity automation.

Even then, do you really not think cultures can have an impact on characteristics? If I were to pick a chinese who grew up in california versus a chinese who grew up in beijing, chances are the one in california would be more liberal and outgoing wouldn’t it? Simply because the society in california is more open minded than that of beijing. 

Here’s another analogy. Would you rather have your son/daughter date a black who grew up in a community where gang wars, rape, robbery, assault is the norm or one who grew up in a safer community?

You have never met either of them and that’s the only information you know. Statistically and logically you would go with the second choice wouldn’t you? Maybe the first guy is a saint and the second guy is a psychopath but the chances of this is low. 

Racism is a huge problem, but I think hypocritically denigrating people for racism is also a problem.

Minimum wage is the least an employer can legally pay a worker. This may cause employers to raise standards (3 year work experience only, graduates in related field only, etc) that may not justify the wage to be paid. In the short term view, people may lose jobs/opportunities to get jobs. People who are willing to get paid less to do the same work in order to get paid cannot legally do so, and people who get the job are often over qualified and overworked.

The problem with dorms in sg is more of how they are set up, rather than their existence. If set up well and maintained, it would function like a housing grant (or properties) provided by certain companies offer.

482,"> # New dorm standards good for workers but will come with inevitable cost hike: Dorm operators

> SINGAPORE - New standards for migrant worker dormitories will enhance workers' well-being, said dormitory operators here, but will come with a cost increase of at least 50 per cent to implement them in existing dorms.

> Under new specifications announced by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) on Monday (June 1), dorms will have no more than 10 beds per room, with only single-deck beds and 1m spacing between them. Each room now holds 12 to 16 beds.

> In recent weeks, the living conditions of foreign workers in dormitories have come under scrutiny as workers account for more than 90 per cent of Covid-19 cases here.

> Each resident will enjoy 6 sq m of living space, not including shared facilities, compared with 4.5 sq m now, which includes shared facilities. Not more than five people will share a toilet, bathroom and sink, compared with 15 people currently.

> As a result, costs will increase significantly on all fronts, said dorm operators, with most agreeing on at least 50 per cent.

> Mr Calvin Lim, general manager of CDPL (Tuas) Dormitory, said building costs could even double, depending on factors such as the dorm's remaining lease-term and its tenancy agreements with employers.

> ""If all things stayed constant and we just reduced double-deck beds to single beds, the cost per bed could already be doubled. And that's excluding the other changes and the additional operational costs that are bound to increase over time,"" he said.

> President of the Dormitory Association of Singapore Johnathan Cheah expects building costs to double, along with a 50 per cent increase in operating costs. These should be shared by employers, dorm operators and the Government, he said.

> ""Dorm operations might well be a 24/7 feature in future as more manpower would be needed to implement the measures, such as stepping up on housekeeping,"" he said.

> Related Story New standards to be piloted at upcoming Quick Build Dorms

> Related Story Most residents understand why workers moved to estates: MPs

> Centurion chief executive Kong Chee Min agreed that building costs will make the bulk of the cost increase, though he did not specify by how much.

> He said existing and interested new operators have to consider the cost of development and operations as well as the revenue potential in the open market, to assess the viability of the business.

> He said: ""There'll be a continued need for migrant worker housing and purpose-built dormitories will continue to be the best solution to address such housing needs in land-scarce Singapore.""

> The new specifications will be piloted at upcoming Quick Build Dormitories, short- to medium-term housing to house around 25,000 workers. These semi-permanent structures will be ready by the end of this year and will last for about two to three years.

> The Straits Times understands that new and existing operators are likely to be invited to run these upcoming dorms, although the authorities have yet to detail licensing and cost arrangements.

> Another 11 purpose-built dorms to house up to 100,000 workers are in the works and are expected to be ready in the next two years.

> Mr Jack Ng, facilities manager of Hulett Dormitory, said he will look at upgrading his 1,200-bed factory converted dormitory at Senoko Drive after some workers can be rehoused in the Quick Build Dormitories.

> Related Story Embracing dignity of work and workers

> Related Story Why Singapore cannot cut down on foreign workers the way other countries have

> Related Story Racism and xenophobia resurfacing during Covid-19: MCCY minister Grace Fu

> He added that Hulett Dormitory, which charges $280 per worker per month, has no plans to increase its prices at the moment as it is focused on getting the dorm a cleared status from MOM so workers can resume work.

> Dr Harvey Neo, programme head at the Lee Kuan Yew Centre for Innovative Cities at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, said the new guidelines are a ""significant improvement"" as they distinguish between different living spaces and reduce density in the dorms.

> Regardless of how the cost is distributed among the various stakeholders, Dr Neo said it should not filter down to the foreign workers as there is ""no compelling reason"" to do so.

> Mr Lee Chew Chiat, government and public services industry leader at Deloitte South-east Asia, said while the cost hike is inevitable, it is worth considering what the alternative cost would be without these new measures in time of pandemics such as Covid-19.

> He said: ""The fundamental question should be why do we need these new measures? If we are doing it for the right reasons, then it's wise to implement them and then work to increase the benefit over cost.""

483,"I am okay with forking out more money when I feel it is worth it. Thing is - it seems presumptuous to assume that we consumers should be the ones to bear the entirety of the increased costs. Don’t the construction companies earn enough to absorb some of these costs as well? Don’t they have any responsibility to play here?

After all, remind me again who has been reaping the rewards of hiring all these cheap foreign labour and getting away with providing substandard living conditions for them. Then when things go to shit, the government has stepped in to bail them out with taxpayer money. 

So it seems like the perpetrators have managed to get away every step of the way.

572,"To quote Yong Han Poh in her facebook post (that was well written and linked to two other interesting opinions on this matter which I unfortunately can't link to because this subreddit doesn't allow for Facebook links):

""I don’t agree with many things in Dr. Tan’s post, but that doesn’t mean I fully agree with Dr. Leong’s post either.

On the first two points, yes, I understand that there are numerous policy considerations and the apparent “U-turn” came because of a mix of changing epidemiology and strategic / security concerns relating to mask supply and so forth. Like Dr. Leong, I don’t blame the government for revising their policies given changing circumstances. I also think we have remarkable testing capacity, and I don’t doubt that many contingency plans have been put in place to avoid over-straining our healthcare system. On these fronts, I applaud the government.

It’s really his third point that I want to critique. Dr. Leong says that his ""hypothesis is that the real root cause for the foreign dorm infections was the humongous number of asymptomatic cases.” He even throws in a thought experiment: “Suppose the Government has just listened to these NGOs. Every single one of these foreigner workers had their own single rooms with attached bathroom and sauna. Best in Singapore and Batam also. We throw in a cleaning auntie to do area cleaning for them and do their laundry. Just imagine that. Do we believe that it would have allowed us to avoid the current problem with the foreign worker dorms? Obviously, this would increase social distancing and *maybe* help somewhat. But guess what? The workers will still be eating together and working together. Do people understand how infectious this virus is? Even healthcare workers in full PPE can still catch it. Confirm will still kenna. Who are we kidding?” 

What is the counter-factual here? I recognize neither of us have any data, but since Dr. Leong uses a thought experiment to make his assertion, I’m going to use his logic to illustrate my own speculations. Imagine that migrant workers lived six people to a room (don’t need single room lah horh), attached with their own kitchen and toilets (don’t need sauna also). When Covid hit (and when everyone has been ordered to stop working because of CB), they are able to practice social distancing, and cook for themselves in their own kitchens. They don’t have to be cramped - sometimes thirty-five people to a room - trying to practice social distancing, or rely on MOM to provide them food (dorms typically only have communal kitchens, and some dorms / FCDs don’t have kitchens at all).  I think this could have help stemmed the rapid transmission rates, even if some transmission was still inevitable because of asymptomatic carriers, as Dr. Leong pointed out. The difficulties of practicing social distancing in these dorms and warnings of a possible contagion have been sounded out as early as February by healthcare professionals such as Dr. Jeremy Lim, and echoed again by migrant groups like Geylang Adventures and TWC2. Why weren’t they heeded? This is what I would like to know, and hopefully there will be a Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry convened post-crisis to explore this, and highlight the government’s own considerations and practical constraints for the public. (And if the government already knew it was so infectious, why did it take them so long to commit to distributing free reusable masks and sanitizers for the migrant workers?) 

Dr. Leong also writes, ""I think it’s despicable for these groups to try to use this crisis to advance their lobbying. This is not the time.” I normally try to avoid emotive language in such discussions, but since you used the word, I think it is “despicable"" to accuse NGOs for being opportunistic or having an agenda. By definition, the mission of these NGOs and advocacy groups /is/ to advocate for better migrant rights. What do you want them to do - remain silent amidst a by the way, /national/ crisis? So it’s okay for them to lobby for better rights for migrant workers before Covid but not during? What about the fact that actually, Singapore is having a national conversation about migrant worker policy post-crisis now, and that their voices, together with those of migrant workers’, are very important in helping to shape that? 

Dr Leong also criticizes big mouths for having ""no sense of perspective, no sense of the costs and no sense of the practical constraints.”  This may be fair. Of course everything entails trade-offs. But I don’t think we should fault NGOs or advocacy groups or whichever “big mouths” you might be alluding to for clamouring for migrant rights or better dormitory conditions, even if you find them utopian. The job of the policymaker is to try and achieve “balance” and negotiate between somtimes competing interests and translate utopian ideals into realistic policy. The job of the advocate is to try and push the boundaries of what is possible, to shift mindsets that everything is a cost-based calculation, to introduce rights-based language into public discourse, and to push for a human-centered approach in policy-making. Everyone has a different part to play in the ecosystem. The policy maker has the unglamorous (and sadly, thankless) job of deciding how best to navigate those practical constraints, and what kinds of costs are reasonable. But this is not just an empirical question - it is also a normative one - and it is precisely the normative aspect that these “big mouths” are speaking to, by making us as a public reflect on the principles by which we arrive at these answers in the first place. 
 
Finally, Dr. Leong calls for us to “have a sense of perspective”. He writes, “We are not the only country to have massive numbers of foreign or migrant workers. I don’t believe that the living conditions of our foreigner workers are the worst in the world. Other countries have no COVID infections in their dorms or dorm-equivalents we think? Are people so naive? Note that as far as I know, we are the *only* country, where the PM has appeared on national TV to assure the foreign workers. To tell them, not worry, Singapore will take care of them. Think about that for a moment.”

I’m having trouble fully distinguishing between ""having perspective"" and outright “whataboutism”. It is true that many other countries struggle with Covid infections in their dorm equivalents, and Singapore certainly isn’t the worst in the world. But this doesn’t make the current situation right, or absolve the G of responsibility, even if it does seem to make these failings appear reasonable. We can, and should, aspire to better. I don’t think the G has done terribly on these counts, but it doesn’t mean I think they have done brilliantly either. The PM has appeared on national TV to assure the foreign workers - great. But let’s not conflate these reassurances post-crisis with Singapore’s treatment of migrant workers more generally, and let us not forget the hard work of NGOs and advocacy groups who have been crucial in pushing for more migrant worker protections both before and during this crisis. 

Of course, to quote Dr. Leong, “Don’t just believe what people tell you. Heck, don’t even believe me. Derive everything again by yourself from first principles”. Don’t believe me either. And unlike Dr. Tan and Dr. Leong, I don't have a PhD in anything and certainly don’t claim expertise - these are just my personal thoughts as a humble citizen.""",0,2020-05-31 06:03:09,reddit,quote yong han poh facebook post well written linked two interesting opinions matter unfortunately link subreddit doesn allow facebook links agree many things dr tan post doesn mean fully agree dr leong post either first two points yes understand numerous policy considerations apparent u turn came mix changing epidemiology strategic security concerns relating mask supply forth like dr leong blame government revising policies given changing circumstances also think remarkable testing capacity doubt many contingency plans put place avoid straining healthcare system fronts applaud government really third point want critique dr leong says hypothesis real root cause infections humongous number asymptomatic even throws thought experiment suppose government listened ngos every single one foreigner single rooms attached bathroom sauna best singapore batam also throw cleaning auntie area cleaning laundry imagine believe would allowed us avoid current problem obviously would increase social distancing maybe help somewhat guess still eating together working together people understand infectious even healthcare full ppe still catch confirm still kenna kidding counter factual recognize neither us data since dr leong uses thought experiment make assertion going use logic illustrate speculations imagine lived six people room need single room horh attached kitchen toilets need sauna also hit everyone ordered stop working cb able practice social distancing cook kitchens cramped sometimes thirty five people room trying practice social distancing rely mom provide food typically communal kitchens fcds kitchens think could help stemmed rapid transmission rates even transmission still inevitable asymptomatic carriers dr leong pointed difficulties practicing social distancing warnings possible contagion sounded early february healthcare professionals dr jeremy lim echoed groups like geylang adventures twc2 weren heeded would like know hopefully parliamentary committee inquiry convened post crisis explore highlight government considerations practical constraints public government already knew infectious take long commit distributing free reusable masks sanitizers dr leong also writes think despicable groups try use crisis advance lobbying not time normally try avoid emotive language discussions since used word think despicable accuse ngos opportunistic agenda definition mission ngos advocacy groups advocate better rights want remain silent amidst way national crisis okay lobby better rights not fact actually singapore national conversation policy post crisis voices together important helping shape dr leong also criticizes big mouths no sense perspective no sense costs no sense practical constraints may fair course everything entails trade offs think should fault ngos advocacy groups whichever big mouths might alluding clamouring rights better conditions even find utopian job policymaker try achieve balance negotiate somtimes competing interests translate utopian ideals realistic policy job advocate try push boundaries possible shift mindsets everything cost based calculation introduce rights based language public discourse push human centered approach policy making everyone different part play ecosystem policy maker unglamorous sadly thankless job deciding best navigate practical constraints kinds costs reasonable not empirical question also normative one precisely normative aspect big mouths speaking making us public reflect principles arrive answers first place finally dr leong calls us sense perspective writes not country massive numbers believe living conditions foreigner worst world countries no infections equivalents think people naive note far know country pm appeared national tv assure tell not worry singapore take care think moment trouble fully distinguishing perspective outright whataboutism true many countries struggle infections equivalents singapore certainly worst world doesn make current situation right absolve g responsibility even seem make failings appear reasonable should aspire better think g done terribly counts doesn mean think done brilliantly either pm appeared national tv assure great let not conflate reassurances post crisis singapore treatment generally let us not forget hard work ngos advocacy groups crucial pushing protections crisis course quote dr leong believe people tell heck even believe derive everything first principles believe either unlike dr tan dr leong phd anything certainly claim expertise personal thoughts humble citizen

I'm a business owner and at some point of time, considered converting part of the factory to a dorm. The requirements are very much stricter than what OP has made it out to be. 

There are restrictions on how many beds you can put in a certain area, how many toilets per number of ppl, fire safety requirements, a sickbay separate from living qtrs must be planned, WiFi is compulsory, even entertainment is a must. These are all set out by big G not the dorm owners. Why will any dorm owner go beyond the basic requirement to make a loss? 

Most people will not believe it but the obscene environment is actually caused by the workers themselves. The best example is hanging clothes. By law, the dorm owner must specifically have an area just for hanging clothes because hanging clothes in your sleeping qtrs is asking for disease to spread but the workers would rather hang them in their own rooms for convenience. 

Many do not practice basic hygiene. My own employees said it was a living hell with bedbug infestations so we moved them out.

There's a limit to how much we can interfere with free market and more importantly, how nice should we treat the employees? Should the cost rise to 2-3k per employee?

619,"Ex-Deputy Prime Ministers Tharman and Teo Chee Hean brought in to handle manpower matters -deputy-prime...r-matters/After Senior Ministers Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Teo Chee Hean were roped in to handle manpower matters like the jobs council and the foreign worker dormitories situation, some Singaporeans are speculating whether Manpower Minister Josephine Teo was given too big a portfolio for her to cope with.Mr Tharman and Mr Teo served as Singapore’s Deputy Prime Ministers from 2011 to 2019. The pair stepped down from their posts and became Senior Ministers on 1 May 2019, following a Cabinet reshuffle that was designed to give fourth-generation (4G) ministers more exposure and responsibilities so that they can better support the next Prime Minister who will come from their cohort.The Cabinet reshuffle saw the ruling People’s Action Party’s (PAP) 4G cohort accept several promotions that resulted in them leading two-thirds of the Government’s ministries. Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat kept his ministry but also succeeded Mr Tharman and Mr Teo as Singapore’s sole Deputy Prime Minister, giving rise to speculation that he is the ruling party’s Prime Minister designate.Besides Mr Tharman and Mr Teo, fellow veteran politician Lim Swee Say stepped down from his post as Manpower Minister and was succeeded by Josephine Teo, who became Singapore’s second female minister to helm a ministry after Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu.While Mr Tharman and Mr Teo seemed to take a backseat to allow the younger ministers to take charge, they have now taken on important responsibilities that pertain to manpower.Current DPM Heng Swee Keat tapped on Mr Tharman to chair the new National Jobs Council. Asserting that his predecessor has “both detailed knowledge and deep expertise in this issue” in his latest supplementary budget speech last month, Mr Heng revealed that the National Jobs Council will focus on creating jobs and helping workers build deep skills to stay employable in the challenging economy.Mr Teo was brought in to handle the foreign worker dormitories issue after COVID-19 outbreaks in the dorms ended up infecting over 33,567 workers and counting. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that Mr Teo is playing an advisory role in the Government’s inter agency task force to handle the situation in the dorms.The veteran politicians’ involvement in what are perceived as manpower matters has raised questions about the capabilities of Manpower Minister Josephine Teo.Mrs Teo was just recently under public scrutiny for the way she handled the COVID-19 outbreaks at the foreign worker dormitories. Some Singaporeans blamed the minister for allowing the COVID-19 situation to spiral out of control among migrant workers even though she was warned in advance that this might happen due to the workers’ overcrowded living conditions.When she was asked why she did not act early in implementing safe distancing measures in the dorms before the coronavirus infection spread uncontrolled, Mrs Teo did not apologise and instead blamed a lack of hindsight.Expressing a wish to “rewind the clock” to implement safe distancing measures in the dorms earlier, she told the local press: “If possible, I really wish to know at which stage the infection has already spread to community and migrant workers group? If time can be rewound, this is what I wish I could know.”",0,2020-06-06 10:25:00,sgtalk,ex deputy prime ministers tharman teo chee hean brought handle manpower matters deputy prime r matters senior ministers tharman shanmugaratnam teo chee hean roped handle manpower matters like jobs council situation singaporeans speculating whether manpower minister josephine teo given big portfolio cope mr tharman mr teo served singapore deputy prime ministers 2011 2019 pair stepped posts became senior ministers 1 may 2019 following cabinet reshuffle designed give fourth generation 4g ministers exposure responsibilities better support next prime minister come cohort cabinet reshuffle saw ruling people action party pap 4g cohort accept several promotions resulted leading two thirds government ministries finance minister heng swee keat kept ministry also succeeded mr tharman mr teo singapore sole deputy prime minister giving rise speculation ruling party prime minister designate besides mr tharman mr teo fellow veteran politician lim swee say stepped post manpower minister succeeded josephine teo became singapore second female minister helm ministry minister culture community youth grace fu mr tharman mr teo seemed take backseat allow younger ministers take charge taken important responsibilities pertain manpower current dpm heng swee keat tapped mr tharman chair new national jobs council asserting predecessor detailed knowledge deep expertise issue latest supplementary budget speech last month mr heng revealed national jobs council focus creating jobs helping build deep skills stay employable challenging economy mr teo brought handle issue outbreaks ended infecting 33 567 counting prime minister lee hsien loong said mr teo playing advisory role government inter agency task force handle situation veteran politicians involvement perceived manpower matters raised questions capabilities manpower minister josephine teo mrs teo recently public scrutiny way handled outbreaks singaporeans blamed minister allowing situation spiral control among even though warned advance might happen due overcrowded living conditions asked not act early implementing safe distancing measures infection spread uncontrolled mrs teo not apologise instead blamed lack hindsight expressing wish rewind clock implement safe distancing measures earlier told local press possible really wish know stage infection already spread community group time rewound wish could know

653,"Potong Pasir SMC resident since late 2018
Previously Bukit Batok SMC resident, voted twice (GE then By Election - Murali v Chee)

I’m always cautious about assuming what the sentiment on the ground is. Reddit is a bubble and so are our take on things. But I thought I’d chip in with my own sentiments. 

Potong Pasir is a tough call. It’s a “low risk” SMC with rich political history and it could go either way. On one hand, under Sitoh’s watch, there are now covered walkways from the MRT to all blocks, the canal was spruced up and looks great, home improvement, etc. The area looks modern with very little sense of Chiam left. The older residents look back fondly on their Chiam days but appreciate new, better accessibility. Younger families like mine have moved into the estate, plus there are new residential developments.

So it's very likely that the virus spread had been going around for some time in the dormitories, and we are now seeing all the indicators of it.""He said that Singapore is currently dealing with two separate infections  within the foreign worker dormitories, where the numbers are rising sharply, and within the general population, where the numbers are more stable now.MOH working with MOM, SPF, MINDEF and SAFWith regard to the dormitory clusters, MOH has been working very closely with the joint task force that's led by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the Singapore Police Force (SPF), Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) and the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF).MOH has set-up medical posts in the dormitories where medical personnel can look after workers as they present with symptoms.In addition, MOH is also performing an active case finding to look for workers who are not well and bring them down for further assessment if necessary.When symptomatic workers are identified, they would be immediately isolated and prevented from mixing with other workers in the dormitory.If they test positive for Covid-19, they will be treated at a hospital or community isolation facility.Those who are not tested positive but remain symptomatic they will be kept separated so as to prevent any infection from spreading to other workers in the dormitory.-...-mustafa-link/",1.0,2020-09-04 21:03:00,hardwarezone,thursday apr 9 ministry health moh announced 287 new brings total number singapore 1 910 new today 200 related residing links seven clustersspeaking press conference apr 9 moh director medical science kenneth mak revealed contact tracing efforts established links seven clusters mustafa centreproject glory construction sites11 punggoltampines dormitorytoh guan dormitorysungei tengah lodgecochrane lodge iias apr 8 total number clusters excluding ones mustafa 224 started mustafa clustermak explained began mustafa cluster number employees mall tested positive believe visited mustafa subsequently transmitted infection co either project glory construction site residents within lived said mak believed transmissions likely occurred close contact mealtimes physical proximity construction site subsequently transmitted friends colleagues within social activities continued work despite mild symptomsnational development minister lawrence wong added many mild symptoms thus continued work stated delay picking likely spread going around time seeing indicators said singapore currently dealing two separate infections within numbers rising sharply within general population numbers stable moh working mom spf mindef safwith regard clusters moh working closely joint task force led ministry manpower mom singapore police force spf ministry defence mindef singapore armed forces saf moh set medical posts medical personnel look present symptoms addition moh also performing active case finding look not well bring assessment necessary symptomatic identified would immediately isolated prevented mixing test positive treated hospital community isolation facility not tested positive remain symptomatic kept separated prevent infection spreading mustafa link

> Actually it’s not about the operators not wanting to give the residents decent life 

They do, but never at the expense of P&L. If the operators can squeeze in 20 people in a small room, they will. It's only the government regulations which prevent them.

The issue is not about the social objections. 

>We already have seen the faces of few masters on how they treat their maids. 

Please be mindful of *Negativity Bias*. Bad news sell better, that's a fact. This gives the false impression that Singaporeans are abusing their FDW regularly. In truth, Singaporeans are just like any other employers in other parts of the world. There are a few abusive ones, but the majority are compassionate people.

In fact, close to [8 in 10 Singaporeans](--en/index.htm) are were in favour of improved labour conditions for foreign domestic workers (FDW). 

It is not lack of popular support for better welfare of FW. It's the lack of political willpower. The government is being weighed down by an important but low productivity industry (construction) for many years. Singapore construction sector is 30% less productive than Japan.

This is a fallacy. One does not need to take up any form of office to impress the opinion that something needs to be done. If this were so, nobody could say ""this is right."" or ""this is wrong."" without having first studied the law. 

>then show me the space to quarantine 20,000 workers who are not even nationals.

we need them. they need us. it is a relationship of symbiosis. the least we can do is provide food, shelter, and compensation. in times of peace, it is left to capitalism, the dormitory operator, the construction companies' hiring practices. in times of a humanitarian disaster-in-waiting, it is not just for the taskforce, or government to help. it is for everyone. this is not a singaporean issue. this is a humanitarian issue (read: human issue). your position of ""why should we help those not even singapore nationals"" reeks, REEKS of hierarchy, as if you believe there is a natural order when it comes down to humanity. they are on singapore soil. they are our issue. in the first place, we should have housed them adequately. do you live in a HDB? say a regular 4-room HDB with a 4-member family. you wanna live in the same size flat with 4 times the people? or more?  if you cannot accept it for yourself, don't foist it on other people. 

>Show me the volunteers/fnb employees, who they themselves have to observe social distancing measures, that are willing to cook 2-3 meals a day for that many people.

The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has decided that further measures are necessary to contain the risk of further transmission among the foreign workers within these two dormitories. This would keep the workers safe, as well as protect the wider community from widespread transmission from these clusters. Both S11 Dormitory @ Punggol and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory have been declared as isolation areas. Onsite medical support has been deployed, along with provision of food and essential supplies.Measures to contain further outbreak3.    The S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, with 13,000 resident workers, and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory, with 6,800 resident workers, have been gazetted as isolation areas. Given the rising number of confirmed cases, this is necessary to avoid the risk of further transmissions from any potentially infected workers to others in the dormitories, as well as into the community. Workers who are symptomatic have already been isolated.4.    Within these two dormitories, precautionary steps have also been taken to protect workers who are well. All the affected workers will not go to work. Access to recreational facilities will be regulated to reduce the inter-mixing of workers. Movement between blocks is prohibited. Workers have also been advised to cease social interactions with others who do not reside in the same room or floor.5.    MOM is working closely with all dormitory operators, to implement similar measures within their premises with immediate effect. Efforts are also underway in the larger dormitories to reduce the density of their resident workers, by transferring some among them to alternative accommodation during this period.Support provided to workers6.    The workers will continue to be paid their salaries for the duration of the quarantine. Their period of absence from work is treated as paid hospitalisation leave as part of the worker’s leave eligibility under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA). Their employers are eligible to claim for the $100 daily quarantine allowance.7.    Arrangements will be made to cater three meals a day for all affected workers for the duration of the quarantine. They will also be issued with reusable masks, surgical masks, thermometers, hand sanitisers and other essentials so they can keep themselves safe and comfortable.8.    Onsite medical support has been deployed to support the workers residing at both dormitories. The dormitories have also implemented enhanced health screening measures, such as requiring workers to check and report their temperature twice daily, as well as the regular monitoring for fever and respiratory symptoms. Those who are unwell will be isolated and will be assessed by medical personnel for further attention. Support provided to companies with affected workers9.    Companies that are providing essential services with workers affected by this quarantine order will be supported and arrangements will be made to ensure these essential services can continue to be provided.Advisory to dormitory operators10.   Dormitory operators and workers living in dormitories are reminded of the importance of maintaining high standards of hygiene and cleanliness to safeguard their own health and those of others who are living in the same space. Safe distancing measures must be strictly adhered to. These include measures such as no inter-mixing of workers between dormitory blocks and floors, and for workers to stay within their rooms and to minimise interactions.11.   Social responsibility is critical in slowing the transmission of the virus. We need every individual to play their part in the fight against the virus. Those who are unwell, even with mild flu-like symptoms, should not be at work. They must see a doctor immediately to prevent spreading illness to others.MINISTRY OF HEALTH & MINISTRY OF MANPOWER5 APRIL 2020MOH think they can outrun the virus with such half-f**ked reactive measures......how wrong they are.....",0,2020-05-04 19:53:00,hardwarezone,highligh er dormitories5th apr 2020 ministry manpower mom issued advisories enhanced precautionary measures minimise risk transmission however transmissions within continued rise seeing confirmed ill s11 punggol 2 seletar north link westlite toh guan 18 toh guan road east particular concern 2 multi ministry taskforce decided measures necessary contain risk transmission among within two would keep safe well protect wider community widespread transmission clusters s11 punggol westlite toh guan declared isolation areas onsite medical support deployed along provision food essential supplies measures contain outbreak3 s11 punggol 13 000 resident westlite toh guan 6 800 resident gazetted isolation areas given rising number confirmed necessary avoid risk transmissions potentially infected others well community symptomatic already isolated 4 within two precautionary steps also taken protect well affected not go work access recreational facilities regulated reduce inter mixing movement blocks prohibited also advised cease social interactions others not reside room floor 5 mom working closely operators implement similar measures within premises immediate effect efforts also underway larger reduce density resident transferring among alternative accommodation period support provided workers6 continue paid salaries duration quarantine period absence work treated paid hospitalisation leave part leave eligibility employment manpower act efma employers eligible claim 100 daily quarantine allowance 7 arrangements made cater three meals day affected duration quarantine also issued reusable masks surgical masks thermometers hand sanitisers essentials keep safe comfortable 8 onsite medical support deployed support residing also implemented enhanced health screening measures requiring check report temperature twice daily well regular monitoring fever respiratory symptoms unwell isolated assessed medical personnel attention support provided companies affected workers9 companies providing essential services affected quarantine order supported arrangements made ensure essential services continue provided advisory operators10 operators living reminded importance maintaining high standards hygiene cleanliness safeguard health others living space safe distancing measures must strictly adhered include measures no inter mixing blocks floors stay within rooms minimise interactions 11 social responsibility critical slowing transmission need every individual play part fight against unwell even mild flu like symptoms should not work must see doctor immediately prevent spreading illness others ministry health ministry manpower5 april 2020moh think outrun half f ked reactive measures wrong

718,"How in the world is it that what you manage to take away from that chunk of text that *math is important, and if you can't do math brown people should die?*

Literal tax paying citizens of Hong Kong lives in more inhumane conditions. Did you even read what I wrote? 

Living in a dormitory cluster is not inhumane. We are not throwing them into the slums where people have to literally live surrounded by their own waste with no readily available source of water or sanitary toilets. 

Just what kind of living conditions do you believe FW dorms to be?

They won't die if covid did not exist, and more people are dying per capita from covid in the United States than foreign workers.

If you are using deaths from covid as a statistic, the citizens of the United States has less livable condition than foreign workers in Singapore. If you are saying people are dying because of the living condition, bring up evidence, because as far as I can tell, nothing has even come close to being negligent enough to cause death. 

Most if not all foreign worker death comes from workplace accidents.

Clearly that's not an accurate way to measure living conditions.

They live in humane conditions. Living in a bunk setting is far from inhumane. Amenities are provided to ensure they are living in humane condition. 

In the right time living next to a volcano provide fertile land, in the wrong time living next to a volcano is a death trap.

There was a push but recently has definitely stagnated. I mean just compare an average construction worker here and one in south korea, germany etc. Clearly there is huge rooms for improvement, why is this not happening? Beside training its the whole “lifecycle” of vocational training, respected nature of the job, pay and responsibility. I agree training wont be enough, its far deeper than that. Its a whole structural change. To change this will need very big mindset shift and right policies. Probably will take 20years minimum but need to start somewhere. SG need to get off this addiction. I mean think about it why is it that singapore, gulf states among developed countries are the only ones doing this? 

Yes there is some migrant labour due to lower cost also in other developed countries(Eg from Poland within EU) but they dont take up the majority, in sg its 99%+.

In the past you can make the argument that in order to make SG grow as fast as possible to reach first world status we took cheap labour so locals could focus on higher skilled jobs but in recent years economy has not grown that much. We already reached a very high status, among top in GDP/capita in fact. We are no longer catchup like in the past yet we see cheap labour in same way. Something is wrong here. Better be a respected construction supervisor than a jobless PMET...

Also when it comes to gov i disagree the gov is pushing hard for it. As TWC2 pointed out the rules are not being enforced properly. In addition companies tender for gov contracts. Surely gov can stipulate a minimum standard. Again need to be enforced and not just going through the motions. Gov can push a lot harder here. Just having all rules followed would make a big impact.

842,"Foreign workers who are unwell are being identified and separated from other workers, said the multi-agency task force tackling the Covid-19 outbreak, adding that even those who do not show symptoms but are close contacts of confirmed cases are being tested.As of Tuesday (April 14), it said about 7,000 workers who are well and working in essential services have been moved outside of dormitories to other accommodations such as army camps.The task force gave an outline of the measures that have been taken in recent days to tackle the spike in the number of Covid-19 cases involving foreign worker dormitories.It said more than 1,500 workers who have been transferred out of dormitories deemed as isolation areas have been tested over the weekend, and about 5,000 workers are expected to be tested in the next few days.The Ministry of Health's director of medical services, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, said in a virtual press conference: ""Our commitment to the foreign workers is that if they are infected, we want to find them, and we want to be very clear that we're not intending to leave them alone, unattended.""So if we have any concerns, particularly in any of the dormitories where there is, in fact, an infected foreign worker, then we want to know where they are and we will make plans to test as many of them as is possible.""Work is ongoing to test asymptomatic workers or those with minimal symptoms, Prof Mak said.""In some dormitories, we have started work to screen close contacts of confirmed cases. For example, they may be fellow workers who share the same room and, because of their proximity of contact in their living arrangements, are deemed therefore as at higher risk.""We also have tested various other foreign workers in different settings. For example, for some of the workers that have in fact been transferred out from the dormitories that are deemed as isolation areas, we've also tested as a precaution to make sure that as we transfer workers from one place to another, we're not also then seeding new areas, and therefore contributing causing more clusters.""Replying to a question on the number of patients housed at the Singapore Expo, Prof Mak said there were 297 patients there as of yesterday. Another 150 to 160 patients will be transferred there today.""It's steadily building... in fact, would span across several halls. At this point in time, we are planning to use Halls 1 to 6, but we have opened Hall 3 first,"" he said.""And as Hall 3 progressively gets filled up to its full capacity of 480 cases... then we would progressively open the other halls as well until we reach our full capacity.""",1.0,2020-04-14 20:25:00,hardwarezone,unwell identified separated said multi agency task force tackling outbreak adding even not show symptoms close contacts confirmed tested tuesday april 14 said 7 000 well working essential services moved outside accommodations army camps task force gave outline measures taken recent days tackle spike number involving said 1 500 transferred deemed isolation areas tested weekend 5 000 expected tested next days ministry health director medical services associate professor kenneth mak said virtual press conference commitment infected want find want clear not intending leave alone unattended concerns particularly fact infected want know make plans test many possible work ongoing test asymptomatic minimal symptoms prof mak said started work screen close contacts confirmed example may fellow share room proximity contact living arrangements deemed therefore higher risk also tested various different settings example fact transferred deemed isolation areas also tested precaution make sure transfer one place another not also seeding new areas therefore contributing causing clusters replying question number patients housed singapore expo prof mak said 297 patients yesterday another 150 160 patients transferred today steadily building fact would span across several halls point time planning use halls 1 6 opened hall 3 first said hall 3 progressively gets filled full capacity 480 would progressively open halls well reach full capacity
843,"Linked vs non-linked, age groups

The current categorisation is very Singaporean-centric if you critically examine it. 

Why is there a need to split work permit holders into two categories (dorm and non-dorm)? The ones who don't stay in the dorm are as likely to have spread the virus as those other the ""local cases in the community"" category since their residences are not geographically removed from the rest of us. 

There category of ""local cases in the community"" is quite strange also if you consider that someone living in Bedok will probably not get the virus from someone living in Jurong/Yishun and vice versa. Given the current measures in place to minimise the spread of the virus.

Overall the categorisation is fully not geographical or spatial.

884,"Hi there, coz of my poly project many years back, I have been to those shophouses in Little India, Farrer Park that was converted into living dorms for foreign workers and we interviewed them too. If u are wondering how we gained access to these shophouses, it's coz one of my proj mate's dad is a contractor and he allowed us access to the shophouses dorms.

So this is what I have observed and it's based on my perspective, first floor is their kitchen and toilet/laundry area and second floor is their bunk beds where they sleep.

First floor when I step in, it's the kitchen, there were dead cockroaches and ants crawling around. There were one foreign worker in charge of meal at the time, preparing meals for everyone (they all were given a role in the dorm) the quality of the food was subpar, for example vegetable was full of holes and yellowish and eggs were already past the expiration date. (They had no choice as they were given these food to cook their meals as some do not wish to spend their money on groceries) 

Toilet was dirty and really smelly and black mold could be seen everywhere in the toilet. 

In the second floor, they slept in bunk beds with mattresses, however their mattresses were really thin and stained. Their personal belongings could be seen scattered everywhere on the floor as there were no cupboard or tables for them to store securely. Just bunk beds.

Minister of State & Manpower stated 
> Mr Zaqy said conditions at the dormitory were found to be satisfactory when the last inspection was done on March 4.

So if ""shitty conditions"" can pass MOM inspection standards.

Question to be asked:

* Are amenities adequate for the workers to use?
* Is the inspection criteria stringent to ensure liveability? (Electrical, plumbing etc) Or the inspection was done half fuck?
* Problem of deplorable living conditions have already been around from initial -> current ""satisfactory"" conditions. Are the laws/ standards created to hit the bare minimum of the workers ""rights""? Social workers working with them have already mentioned these issues over many years.

[Source](-conditions-at-punggol-dormitory-could-have-been-better-maintained-as-it-was-made)

Even if the workers fuck shit up in the dorms, isn't inspection meant to uncover these teething problems and reflect it to ministry & dormitory providers?

I see all these moves by the governing agency to move them out as a way to 

* Solve current ""satisfactory but deplorable"" conditions on paper
* Solve the now exploding increase of infection rate
* Sweep their crap way of handling treating of FW from the past till current under the rug (inspection criteria) 
* Acknowledge but don't apologize for past failings wrt. handling of the foreign workers situation

Ultimately, we as a society need to pay the price for the situation mentioned above. Prices of HDB have remained pretty cheap while cost of workers have increased over time. We as a society have also chosen to push them away from general population areas in fear of losing property value etc.

948,"The actual reporting is good. The guidelines for purpose built dorms were made in response to the riots. But the standards are clearly not strict enough or not enforced. Forget about facilities. The number of residents per sq ft of sleeping area, the ratio of stoves, toilets, showers and sinks to residents, is it enough?

According to Speak for Climate, The current building code says that “A minimum of 4.5sqm Gross Floor Area of living space per worker shall be provided”. This minimum standard is 6 times lower than the average living space per Singaporean of 27 sqm.

The current environmental health guidelines for dormitories are 1 water closet, 1 urinal, 1 wash-hand basin, and 1 shower room for every 15 workers. This standard is close to 3 times worse than the International Labour Organisation (ILO)’s recommendation of a minimum of 1 toilet, 1 wash basin and 1 shower for every 6 persons.

Edit: of course I don't think we should match 27 sqm. But 6 times less is a lot smaller. HDB and URA has maximum occupancy for a residence if occupants do not form a family unit. A 2 room flat has a maximum occupancy of 4 unrelated people and is from 36-45 sq m and has 1 toilet, shower, and 2 sinks, one in the kitchen. 3 room flat and above can fit 6 unrelated people, and for 3 room (60-65 sq m) there are 2 toilets, 2 showers, and 3 sinks. 

The minimum ratio is therefore 9 sq m per person in HDB. Even a family of 10 in a 3 room HDB would be 6 sq m per person, and 1 person better than ILO recommendations.  These are ratios that we can apply.",1.0,2020-05-02 13:23:18,reddit,actual reporting good guidelines purpose built made response riots standards clearly not strict enough not enforced forget facilities number residents per sq ft sleeping area ratio stoves toilets showers sinks residents enough according speak climate current building code says minimum 4 5sqm gross floor area living space per shall provided minimum standard 6 times lower average living space per singaporean 27 sqm current environmental health guidelines 1 water closet 1 urinal 1 wash hand basin 1 shower room every 15 standard close 3 times worse international labour organisation ilo recommendation minimum 1 toilet 1 wash basin 1 shower every 6 persons edit course think should match 27 sqm 6 times less lot smaller hdb ura maximum occupancy residence occupants not form family unit 2 room flat maximum occupancy 4 unrelated people 36 45 sq 1 toilet shower 2 sinks one kitchen 3 room flat fit 6 unrelated people 3 room 60 65 sq 2 toilets 2 showers 3 sinks minimum ratio therefore 9 sq per person hdb even family 10 3 room hdb would 6 sq per person 1 person better ilo recommendations ratios apply
