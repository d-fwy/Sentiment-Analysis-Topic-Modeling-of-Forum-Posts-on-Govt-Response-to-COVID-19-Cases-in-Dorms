0,">For consistency and accuracy, it could be easier to use data from the new MOH Situation Report which separates into Dorm, non-Dorm foreigners and Citizen/PR.

I think they only count those from the named dorm clusters into ""Dorm"". So those who are either linked to construction sites or who live in non-cluster dorms get categorized as ""Linked to Other Clusters"" or ""Pending Investigations"" respectively.

So the MOH situation report for 28-3 to 10-4 LTP holders has 545 linked to dorm clusters, 126 linked to other clusters, and 141 pending investigations. Whereas my estimate for the same time period is 702 dorm/construction-related.

The reason I make these graphs is that there are really 2 separate COVID problems in Singapore. Circuit Breaker can slow down the growth of the cases in the general public. But other than stopping work at construction sites, Circuit Breaker doesn't help the dorm/construction site problem. The dorm/construction site problem has to be tackled by improving the living conditions of these workers, testing them, separating the sick from the well. And conversely, issues of way too many people ""exercising"", eating at hawker centres, sneakily meeting up etc only affect the non-dorm problem. 

And yes, the testing situation is worrisome. I do not know how they are prioritizing the tests. And it would be political suicide for MOH to admit that they are either prioritizing SC/PR cases first (patriotism) or the dorm workers (because it is more urgent to separate the sick in cramped conditions).",0,2020-04-11 12:26:38,reddit,consistency accuracy could easier use data new moh situation report separates non foreigners citizen pr think count named clusters either linked construction sites live non cluster get categorized linked clusters pending investigations respectively moh situation report 28 3 10 4 ltp holders 545 linked clusters 126 linked clusters 141 pending investigations whereas estimate time period 702 construction related reason make graphs really 2 separate problems singapore circuit breaker slow growth general public stopping work construction sites circuit breaker doesn help construction site problem construction site problem tackled improving living conditions testing separating sick well conversely issues way many people exercising eating hawker centres sneakily meeting etc affect non problem yes testing situation worrisome not know prioritizing tests would political suicide moh admit either prioritizing sc pr first patriotism urgent separate sick cramped conditions

2,"I work nearby to the Westlite and Toh Guan Dorms. 

After the initial reports of Westlite having covid cases, I saw they were still open and operating as usual, even all the food stalls and the provision shop there. I was rather surprised they didn't try to isolate the situation earlier. 

I understand that maybe they couldn't just put everyone there under SHN immediately because of the financial implications, but I did wonder why they still allowed the workers to still congregate at the eating place and they also allowed the provision shop stay open. I didn't see any sanitizing stuff going on myself, but to be fair I have been telecommuting for most of the week so they may have done it without me seeing it.

Now after there are so many more cases, they decided to 'lock down' the place. And it also spread to Toh Guan Dormitory which is across the road and a couple units down.

I'm quite frustrated that something wasn't done earlier.",0,2020-04-06 20:55:47,reddit,work nearby westlite toh guan initial reports westlite saw still open operating usual even food stalls provision shop rather surprised didn try isolate situation earlier understand maybe couldn put everyone shn immediately financial implications wonder still allowed still congregate eating place also allowed provision shop stay open didn see sanitizing stuff going fair telecommuting week may done without seeing many decided lock place also spread toh guan across road couple units quite frustrated something wasn done earlier

137,"Most likely its also because its a highly regulated industry (at least at the planning stage maybe not so much on enforcement).

>"" this would require the authorities to review current building guidelines for dorms, such as increasing the gross plot ratio, which limits, among other things, building heights. ""

Meaning that there seems to only be certain designated plots of lands of specific sizes and in specific areas that are allowed for dormitories, no doubt due to our government's extreme focus on city planning. It also seems that there is quite limited land area currently allowed for these types of buildings, perhaps the government not wanting to give up too much land space for 'temporary' workers.

>""Current dorms typically have lease terms of between nine and 30 years.""

Makes sense that why would any developer want to spend the capital to build these  nicer and more spacious dormitories when the land goes back to the government in 10 years. Hence the unwillingness to go beyond the bare minimum.

In any case the dorms were built to current government regulations, albeit at the minimum requirements. This is the area which should have the most focus for change along of course with enforcement.

I don't think you can expect private businesses to do anything more than the legal minimum as there will always be a race to the bottom for an industry as competitive as this. If you think they should do what is 'decent' I can tell you that doing the 'decent' thing means nothing once your competitors undercut and bankrupt you.",0,2020-05-26 16:38:54,reddit,likely also highly regulated industry least planning stage maybe not much enforcement would require authorities review current building guidelines increasing gross plot ratio limits among things building heights meaning seems certain designated plots lands specific sizes specific areas allowed no doubt due government extreme focus city planning also seems quite limited land area currently allowed types buildings perhaps government not wanting give much land space temporary current typically lease terms nine 30 years makes sense would developer want spend capital build nicer spacious land goes back government 10 years hence unwillingness go beyond bare minimum case built current government regulations albeit minimum requirements area should focus change along course enforcement think expect private businesses anything legal minimum always race bottom industry competitive think should decent tell decent thing means nothing competitors undercut bankrupt

""Materials were produced in the workers’ native languages to encourage them to also take steps to protect themselves,"" she said. ""Subsequently, non-essential facilities like gyms and TV-rooms were closed. Mealtimes and recreational hours were staggered.

But that is why we have governments and laws. Governments job is to constrain corporations from doing bad things while allowing profits to flow. What can we people do? We have no power to riot or protest, government took those away from us. The only player here with any real power to constrain these companies is the government, not us. You literally cannot hold your pitchfork outside these dorms, you will go to jail for protesting. 

Additionally we have warned the Government many times that this has been happening. As an analogy, imagine if a murderer is running rampant in your neighbourhood. After the first murder, you can say its the murderer's fault. So you complain to the police to ask him to get caught. But the police does nothing. After the 5th or 6th murder, the neighbourhood would be faulting the police too right?

172,"If govt channels back the funds from the levy into improving living conditions (through subsidising dorms, food etc), that kind of defeats the purpose of the levy because the money will go back to the employer. 

And another problem with improving living conditions can be very subjective - current [purpose built dorms](-worker-dormitories) are already tendered out and regulated by BCA, meaning they have standards to meet such as X m2 of space per pax, cleaning schedules etc. You can only go so far in mandating that the operator meets certain living standards that are quantifiable such as cleaning schedules, caloric requirements per meal, personal space per pax. How about regulating subjective things like taste of food or cuisine, dirty personal accomodation (which can be a lapse in the dorm operator's obligations or lack of personal hygiene by the residents)? Because if you want to penalise or reward dorm operators based on meeting these standards, there must be something that you can measure, not based on opinion. 

I'm not defending or criticising dorm operators and the regulators - but there are challenges with regards to regulation in general and things will never be black and white. It's very easy to be an armchair critic because we are not exposed to the stakeholders' situation, the quirks of each situation etc. It's never blame on one party, and the way the government acts is representative of society's stand on that issue - in this case that largely, society wants FWs kept to a minimum, out of sight, out of mind, and the bare minimum for them.",0,2020-04-13 09:31:20,reddit,govt channels back funds levy improving living conditions subsidising food etc kind defeats purpose levy money go back employer another problem improving living conditions subjective current purpose built already tendered regulated bca meaning standards meet x m2 space per pax cleaning schedules etc go far mandating operator meets certain living standards quantifiable cleaning schedules caloric requirements per meal personal space per pax regulating subjective things like taste food cuisine dirty personal accomodation lapse operator obligations lack personal hygiene residents want penalise reward operators based meeting standards must something measure not based opinion not defending criticising operators regulators challenges regards regulation general things never black white easy armchair critic not exposed stakeholders situation quirks situation etc never blame one party way government acts representative society stand issue case largely society wants fws kept minimum sight mind bare minimum

206,"Yes, they may have died from other conditions, but I’m sure Covid must have played a part in leading to their demise as well. With Covid, and their other health problems, they are essentially fighting two health conditions at once. Which definitely takes a toll on one’s immune system.

If their immune system wasn’t too busy fighting Covid, these patients may have lived another few days. Without Covid, their body would only be fighting one serious health condition and they may have managed to find the strength to recover from that ONE serious health condition. With Covid-19 serving as an unfortunate distractor, the patient’s body’s resources were split up fighting TWO serious health conditions and I’m sure this must have played a part in terms of weakening the patient’s body

While the patient may have officially passed from reasons separate to the coronavirus, I’m certain that the coronavirus had at least a small part to play in their demise.

Classing their deaths as “non-Covid19” deaths is not the right call in my opinion as it plays down the severity of the virus [some people might say “oh look! these people died, but its not from the virus! this means other disease more scary than covid. covid not scary, might as well go out!”]",0,2020-04-17 01:14:48,reddit,yes may died conditions sure must played part leading demise well health problems essentially fighting two health conditions definitely takes toll one immune system immune system wasn busy fighting patients may lived another days without body would fighting one serious health condition may managed find strength recover one serious health condition serving unfortunate distractor patient body resources split fighting two serious health conditions sure must played part terms weakening patient body patient may officially passed reasons separate certain least small part play demise classing deaths non covid19 deaths not right call opinion plays severity people might say oh look people died not means disease scary not scary might well go

230,"There are more than 40,000 Malaysians still in Singapore and the Malaysian state of Johor hopes that Singapore will make exemptions for them to be tested for Covid-19 before they are allowed to return to the state.More Malaysian workers are making their way back from Singapore after the Republic began implementing stricter measures to address the pandemic under a period known as the ""circuit breaker"". The measures which began on April 7 and will go on until May 4 have seen most workplaces and schools closed in order to reduce the risk of infections.Currently, Malaysians who test negative in Singapore will be able to go home and be quarantined there, while those without any certification or prior testing will be required to undergo compulsory 14-day quarantine at one of the government centres statewide.Johor Mentri Besar Hasni Mohammad said the state was working with the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the matter with their counterpart in Singapore given that the city-state presently does not conduct Covid-19 tests unless a person has showed symptoms.Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia Vanu Gopala Menon previously said there was currently no requirement by the Singapore government to provide random Covid-19 tests for foreign workers while Singapore's Ministry of Health has said that Covid-19 testing is only performed when clinically indicated, for patients and their close contacts.""That means a Malaysian can't get the test done in Singapore unless they are symptomatic, "" Datuk Hasni said in an interview in the Johor district of Iskandar Puteri.""We hope Singapore will allow for some exemptions so that Malaysians who want to return can get this test done at its clinics or hospitals, "" he said.Hasni said he was confident that the matter would be discussed through the Malaysia-Singapore Special Working Committee on Covid-19 for a solution to be reached.He said since Malaysia implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) on March 18 to curb the coronavirus, it has resolved certain issues, including easing the movement of cargo, essential and non-essential items between both countries as well as accommodation for Malaysian workers in Singapore.""The government will not stop Malaysians returning from Singapore and I can assure them that our frontliners have taken all the necessary steps and procedures at our border, "" he said.Hasni urged returning Malaysians to give their full cooperation to the frontliners conducting the necessary screening and testing at the checkpoints.On the number of Malaysians returning from Singapore after the island republic started its own measures to curb the spread of the virus, Hasni said the biggest influx was registered on April 3 with some 3,400 people.

> I applaud Mr Cheng Shoong Tat for his letter (Why foot the bill for dorm operators that have profited for years?, May 16).

> He is correct to question why taxpayers should foot the bill to clear up a mess the dormitory operators have profited from.

> Singapore has always taken pride in being a beacon for global free enterprise. We are frequently reminded that our prosperity is based on a system of being open to business.

> We have argued that our system works because it does not mollycoddle people amid the realities of the free market.

> Our social assistance programmes are based on ""helping people to help themselves"".

> We help people to retrain and reskill when they lose their jobs, rather than support them financially when they are not working.

> Why should a society that takes pride in not sheltering people from the realities of the free market system find it acceptable to shelter large corporations from the same?

> The reality of the free market system is that it allows you to succeed with minimal government interference, but at the same time you are on your own if you fail.

> The dormitory operators are not innovative start-ups coming up with market-disrupting products that will shape the future. They are not enterprises that hire many Singaporeans in high-paying jobs.

> They make vast profits - Centurion Corp, for example, made $103.8 million on revenue of $133 million for the 12 months ended Dec 31 last year - merely by maximising the number of people in a certain space.

> If our system allows them to earn profits in this manner, should we not also allow them to bear the cost when the system requires them to adapt their businesses to new realities?

452,"Why would someone invest their money in a business that generates 10% profit margin instead of a business that generates 20% margin? 

Genuinely, would you invest in any sort of savings plan that gives less margin than another savings plan, all else being equal? 

You've not answered any of my questions on how this can be enforced when it comes to future constructions and developments. Yes the cost is distributed across society. How would the government enforce this cost? Increase levies and taxes against these construction and development companies? Create a price freeze that is pegged against some arbitrary or historical figure? On top of everything else, there are multiple parties involved. Dormitory owners, construction contractors, and property developers. If you force dormitory owners to absorb the cost of having more spacious lodgings and prohibit them from passing part or all of the additional cost to the construction contractor, then they will either take their money and go somewhere else, or convert their dormitories for more affluent clientele like foreign students, or pass on the cost to recruitment agents in the foreign worker's home countries, which are out of Singaporean jurisdiction. Or just charge the foreign workers more. The same sort of cycle will persist if you put the costs on the contractors, or the developers. 

If somehow these companies are able to be forced to absorb these costs and not pass them on to the consumer, then their P&L numbers go up, making them less attractive to investors, and the industry just doesn't grow. Without this growth, they will probably start cutting costs, beginning with poorer quality work or retrenchment of staff.

523,"Yes definitely the dorm operators are the ones at fault for not doing proper upkeep of the premises. But sadly, you know how it is here in Sg, they’re just gonna keep with the status quo until the Govt slaps them with a warning. Cos even if the migrant workers or advocates sound out to the dorm’s building management, nothing happens. Which is why most of those who voice out about this issue (as well as other issues relating to migrant workers) direct it towards the Govt.

It’s just like how at least 10 (or more) years ago, companies that employ just a small number of foreign workers used to rent an entire HDB unit for their workers, and such “dorms” were often overcrowded as well, until HDB set down the maximum occupancy for each unit (no matter 3/4 room or bigger) to be 6. 

Back then, most worker dorms around were built and managed by the employers, usually large companies that employ a lot of workers, such as SembCorp, Keppel shipyard, etc. Those dorms usually have more amenities & facilities and generally offer a better living environment (but still cannot compare to SAF bunks la).

Then you may be right for the first point but overall, it's meant to ensure the safety of other residents and not to treat them as ""prisoners"" living in a detention camp. Occupants working in different industries like construction or shipping may have access to tools that can pose a danger to other residents. And in a bid to prevent that, they might be checked when entering the facility.

Yes I have also met a worker who has stayed in Singapore for ten years. He's been here for so long because he's working to send all his daughters to medical school in India. He says that the pay back in his home country is not sufficient to do the same. My idea of temporary is that they are not staying here permanently. Workers also usually stay here for years because they are contracted by years and not months. After a period of time be it months or years they eventually leave. That is why I stated it as temporary even though they may have been residing in Singapore for quite some time.

Another point I want to make and I'm not siding on poor treatment of workers but workers have the option to choose their own housing facility albeit rare. Workers don't necessarily have to stay in dormitories, they have the option to rent HDB rooms but many choose not to because its more expensive. In addition, there are also different kinds of dormitories. Some dormitories are better than others but are also more expensive. Employers usually have a budget for housing and if workers instead choose a different housing option that is more expensive, they may be asked to top up the difference. Those that are reluctant have no choice but to stay in the dormitories that are assigned by their employers. This is the reason why I emphasise that workers should keep their quarters clean. If they do not wish to move to more sohphiscated dormitories that are more expensive, they should keep their current ones as clean as possible instead of letting it get filthy.",1,2020-04-08 12:12:14,reddit,may right first point overall meant ensure safety residents not treat prisoners living detention camp occupants working different industries like construction shipping may access tools pose danger residents bid prevent might checked entering facility yes also met stayed singapore ten years long working send daughters medical school india says pay back home country not sufficient idea temporary not staying permanently also usually stay years contracted years not months period time months years eventually leave stated temporary even though may residing singapore quite time another point want make not siding poor treatment option choose housing facility albeit rare necessarily stay option rent hdb rooms many choose not expensive addition also different kinds better others also expensive employers usually budget housing instead choose different housing option expensive may asked top difference reluctant no choice stay assigned employers reason emphasise should keep quarters clean not wish move sohphiscated expensive should keep current ones clean possible instead letting get filthy

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 548 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Sunday (24 May) noon, bringing the total to 31,616..

> Of them, the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories, said the ministry, while three cases are Singaporeans or permanent residents.

> It added that more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of over 2,500 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tuas View Dormitory and Jurong Penjuru Dormitory.

> They are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some 400,000 foreign workers live in dorms here in Singapore.

> Some 20,000 infected foreign workers are expected to be discharged by end-May, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong at a press conference last Tuesday.

> This story will be updated later.

> With 927more cases of COVID-19 infection discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities,  a total of 13,882 cases here have fully recovered from the infection, said the ministry on Friday.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while eight are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Over 16,000 cases with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 23 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, nine others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and two whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> It had also noted that 86 male foreign workers aged 25 to 59 died due to heart disease in Singapore in 2018.

> As of 18 May, the ministry has conducted 294,414 swab tests, of which 191,260 were done on unique individuals.

> This translates to around 51,600 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 33,500 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

561,"Basically, if FWs present respiratory pneumonia like symptoms, they would be deemed to have been clinically diagnosed to have COVID-19 and prolly treated symptomatically for it. But, as the news report on CNA had put it (on Saturday), this means that possibly hundred of such cases would have been left out because, being clinically diagnosed does not equal confirmed, hence these possibly infected cases would not be included in the daily tally of confirmed cases. It does not mean no more testing is done in the dorms, because if FWs have aforementioned symptoms of respiratory pneumonia, they are assumed to have COVID-19 and may be tested later as treatment comes first. I guess it's a way to simplify diagnosis and to assign treatment as priority, but it leaves out a large number of possible confirmed infections.

572,"SINGAPORE  The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (April 9) announced 287 new cases of Covid-19 in Singapore, with many of the cases traced to Mustafa Centre in Little India.Among the new cases, 219 are linked to foreign worker dormitory clusters containing workers who had visited the mall. Another 19 are linked to other known clusters and three are imported.The latest daily tally marks a new record, and is more than double the highest daily spike of 142 cases seen on Wednesday. This brings the total number of confirmed cases here to 1,910.National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-disciplinary taskforce tackling the coronavirus, said at a media briefing on Thursday that Singapore needs a major and urgent intervention to fight the spread of Covid-19 among the foreign worker population.ADVERTISEMENTHe noted that the taskforce requires a dedicated strategy for foreign workers due to the higher rate of transmission among them, and said it had enlisted the help of the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) and Singapore Police Force (SPF).The SAF and SPF will form part of a separate inter-agency taskforce, he said.Mr Wong added that the taskforce had also invited Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean to guide it in this strategy, given his familiarity with police work. Mr Teo had previously been Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Defence.As of Wednesday, six people had died from complications due to Covid-19 infection.Speaking on Thursday at the virtual media briefing on the latest cases, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, MOHs director of medical services, said preliminary links have been established between the clusters at Mustafa Centre, a 51-storey mixed-use construction site called Project Glory at Market Street in the central business district and five dormitories  Tampines Dormitory, S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, Toh Guan Dormitory, Sungei Tengah Lodge and Cochrane Lodge II.Many of these cases, in fact, started out in the cluster at Mustafa, said Assoc Prof Mak.He added that MOH is now testing foreign workers for Covid-19, as many cases who tested positive were workers who had very mild symptoms and were well.Mr Wong said that it is important for Singapore to realise that it is dealing with two separate infections  one in the foreign worker dormitories and one among the local population, where numbers are more stable for now, he added.We have had foreign worker cases before, including cases in dormitories. But this time, it is different, because there are many more venues outside of dorms, like Mustafa Centre and the Project Glory (construction site), where foreign workers had gathered and worked together, and the virus spread among them, he said.And when they went back to the dorms, they transmitted it to fellow dorm residents. So it is very likely that the virus spread has been going around for some time in dorms and we are now seeing the indications of it.That is why Singapore needs a dedicated strategy for foreign workers, Mr Wong added.There is a higher transmission rate among them, due to the high number of workers in close quarters.The strategy will firstly involve the effective management of all dormitories, which means taking care of foreign workers basic needs and well-being, taking into account factors such as cleanliness and food, and ensuring that safe-distancing measures are fully complied with, Mr Wong said.Secondly, MOH has deployed medical posts, first at critical dormitories and then at other foreign worker lodgings, for active testing.To do all of this well, Singapore will need to reduce the number of workers in each dormitory, Mr Wong added.So we are moving them out, those who are not sick, and accommodating them.Singapore Armed Forces military camps, the Changi Exhibition Centre, floating hotels usually used for offshore accommodation and a few vacant Housing and Development Board blocks are among the properties that have been requisitioned for this purpose.Essentially we are sparing no effort, Mr Wong said. We have a responsibility to these foreign workers who come all the way here at considerable expense.Despite our best efforts, all of us will have to be mentally prepared for the number of cases in dorms to rise But we do have comprehensive measures in place, he added.Read more at",1,2020-09-04 20:28:00,hardwarezone,singapore ministry health moh thursday april 9 announced 287 new singapore many traced mustafa centre little india among new 219 linked clusters containing visited mall another linked known clusters three imported latest daily tally marks new record double highest daily spike 142 seen wednesday brings total number confirmed 1 910 national development minister lawrence wong co chairs multi disciplinary taskforce tackling said media briefing thursday singapore needs major urgent intervention fight spread among population advertisementhe noted taskforce requires dedicated strategy due higher rate transmission among said enlisted help singapore armed forces saf singapore police force spf saf spf form part separate inter agency taskforce said mr wong added taskforce also invited senior minister teo chee hean guide strategy given familiarity police work mr teo previously minister home affairs minister defence wednesday six people died complications due infection speaking thursday virtual media briefing latest associate professor kenneth mak moh director medical services said preliminary links established clusters mustafa centre 51 storey mixed use construction site called project glory market street central business district five tampines s11 punggol toh guan sungei tengah lodge cochrane lodge ii many fact started cluster mustafa said assoc prof mak added moh testing many tested positive mild symptoms well mr wong said important singapore realise dealing two separate infections one one among local population numbers stable added including time different many venues outside like mustafa centre project glory construction site gathered worked together spread among said went back transmitted fellow residents likely spread going around time seeing indications singapore needs dedicated strategy mr wong added higher transmission rate among due high number close quarters strategy firstly involve effective management means taking care basic needs well taking account factors cleanliness food ensuring safe distancing measures fully complied mr wong said secondly moh deployed medical posts first critical lodgings active testing well singapore need reduce number mr wong added moving not sick accommodating singapore armed forces military camps changi exhibition centre floating hotels usually used offshore accommodation vacant housing development board blocks among properties requisitioned purpose essentially sparing no effort mr wong said responsibility come way considerable expense despite best efforts us mentally prepared number rise comprehensive measures place added read

575,"Yeah, looks like community cases are stable at a few dozen over the last two weeks. 

I am wondering if the aggressive testing in the dorms are uncovering mild cases that would have otherwise gone undetected. 

For instance, in New York City, 13.5% of pregnant women going into L&D are found to be COVID+ [reference] because they are testing everyone admitted for labor and delivery at the hospital, regardless of whether they have symptoms. If this is anywhere near a representative sample, this implies ~1 million active cases in New York City, compared to 111,424 confirmed cases.

Given that MOH is said to be testing everyone in the dorms in a similar fashion, regardless of symptoms, we might be seeing the same thing play out.

589,"Once again, I do not agree because the new datasets created are not useful. 

Let's use another analogy. Let's say that we want to measure how many fruits are rotting in our warehouse. We have apples and grapes. We have 2 different boxes used to store them and one contains all grapes while others contain a mix of apples and grapes. 

One probable dataset would be AVERAGE ROT for both boxes. Also, AVERAGE ROT OF GRAPES and AVERAGE ROT OF APPLES can be used too. However, the second dataset has no significance since rot of apples and grapes are known to be the same rate, except the grapes have contact from both boxes. We know that grapes in the same box as apples are in the same population, hence it would be less ingenious to use AVERAGE ROT PER BOX as a dataset since we should only have 2 datasets in this scenario, one for each box. Creating one for apple in box 2, one for grapes in box 1, one for grapes in box 2 would not accurately present the P(ROT) for apples, nor the correct POSITIVE R value for apples since a second vector is missing.

611,"I truly believe this is a cumulation of public infrastructure bidding practices, demand for lower cost projects by all parties, high land cost, and lack of innovation in the construction industry both in Singapore and as a whole.

The government is the biggest developer in singapore due to infrastructural contracts. They also run project awards on a lowest bidder wins structure. Some news reports here: [-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116](-in-fatal-viaduct-collapse-won-bid-with-low-safety-9082116)

There are attempts to resolve this tho. But the underlying bidding structure is still lowest bidder wins. [-to-place-greater-emphasis-on-quality-over-price-in-public-building-tenders](-to-place-greater-emphasis-on-quality-over-price-in-public-building-tenders)

So, the company that can squeeze the most margin it can by cutting every possible corner legally tends to stay alive. Typically, such race to the bottom sort of competition would favor companies with deep pockets to out price everyone else (ride sharing, e commerce) and then consolidate as a major player with economies of scale. But we don't see it in construction instead of fighting for your single 10 minute cab ride or $30 dollar 2nd hand bid, they are fighting for million dollar projects that span years. The consolidation does occur with bankruptcies, but here's a list of all the companies that can bid for projects in singapore back in 2016: [-of-construction-companies/](-of-construction-companies/) and they all exist in different tiers.

We could force the costs down their throats, say that workers require XYZ amount of space and living conditions. Where would the cost go? back to the construction project. If squeezing margin out from worker dorms isn't possible, it'd then be reflected back in bidders in the construction project bidding process, and back into the society. Sure, we'd ""fix"" one major sticking point here, but where would the margin come from still? corners cut from infrastructure? worker wages? more bankruptcies and consolidation which can take years to do? 

In the short term, sure, we can ""fine"" the companies and the dorm operators. Just remember that these dorms exist with BCA's full knowledge of them being in the conditions that they are. I don't think punishment is the way to go, but incentivizing innovation and progressive treatment is the better way forward. Both would cost the society, one in indirect manners via cut corners, higher building costs, and destructive bankruptcies and consolidation. The other is a direct cost that we can monitor and help push for a fundamental change in the industry for lower reliance on cheap replaceable labor, replacing them with more effective individuals that are highly skilled, and well paid.

FWIW, I've commented on this a few times:

What is required is basic standards to be met. They are not living in inhuman/ cruel conditions. Their basic needs are met. Emphasis is on ""basic"" - nothing more. 

Seen the pictures of MOM approved dorms online. Yes, some dorms are a bit messy and look cluttered; but area wise, it is comparable to our NS dormitories. 

IF our SAF soldiers and NSFs can stay in such ""inhuman"" bunks, why can't our foreign workers? The complaint, rather should be - maybe we should be making the dorm operators enforce some level of discipline. Maybe more ""stand by area"" and ""area cleaning"". Or hire more cleaners.

Don't forgot that if you actually read the regulations, you will see that it is mandated by law for every dorm to have common areas for recreation; rooms to hang their clothes; sick bays and even wifi.

I think WP will get Aljunied and Hougang (possibly with a slightly more comfortable margin than in 2015).

SMC with highest flip chance for me is Bukit Panjang. The retirement of the incumbent might see just enough votes going over to the oppo.

Bukit Batok, I still don't see it happening. CSJ might actually break 40% this time though.

As for GRCs, I think East Coast GRC will be closer to 2011 elections than 2015 (50+% for the PAP) with a good oppo fielding in the GRC. People overestimate HSK's blunder imo, it will have an effect but will be buried under other issues and be forgotten/rationalized away to some degree by the time polling day comes about. Nevertheless, even a weak 50% mandate for the PM-designate will be damaging to the PAP.

Finally, for West Coast, I think a below 5% margin would already be a very good showing for a new party like the PSP. IMO other than Dr Tan, PSP candidates still have too low of a public recognition outside of Reddit. Their best bet would be to strive for the best result and work the ground really hard over the next 4-5 years.

679,"I have been to a number of dormitories, even multiple times in a single dormitory and it is simply not as abysmal as how you portray it to be. First of all it is definitely not a prison, usually in dormitories there are leisure areas: street soccer and basketball courts being more common while some even have gyms that are equipped enough for the general gym goer(dumbbells and machines) and multi purpose halls that can be used to play badminton. Normally there's also WiFi in each room because the workers all come together and subscribe to one isp so it's not like they have nothing to do when they're in their bunks during their free time. Secondly, they are not locked in their rooms, they are free to wander around the dormitories. I will not assume that they are allowed to use the leisure facilities but if they want to go out and take a walk for a breathe of fresh air it's highly possible. There's also shop(s) in the dormitories that allow them to buy groceries and such although some that I have talked to prefer buying outside because these shops tend to charge higher prices. 

To the point of the conditions of rooms. Generally most rooms are clean . The cleanliness isn't top notch but it's definitely well kept and I'm fine with it. Having said that, cleanliness is also directly dependent on the actions of those living in the room; I have gone to different rooms in the same building and it isn't the same. Some rooms are clean while others have baby cockroaches running around. Ventilation is also usually not a problem, fans are provided in the dorms and not once have I broken a sweat while working in their rooms. I've even worked when all the workers return home from work and it isn't as warm as you think. I've gone to some residential houses where the conditions are worse than a dormitory. Smelly, messy with horrible ventilation. 

To put it simply, yes some of their residential areas aren't ideal. But it's satisfactory in the sense that it's clean and they have areas to be alone or if they want to enjoy the company of others. Workers can't change their living conditions but they have the ability to decide how clean they want their bunks to be. Yes I'm aware that there are companies or dormitories that do not care about the welfare of workers and workers are forced into dormitories with unliveable conditions but I can safely say that its the minority. Please do not write such things about the condition of their living areas when you don't know much about them especially when you've not even been in their rooms because it is painting a  picture based on your false perception which will misguide the public while being unfair for companies/bosses that really take care of their workers.",1,2020-04-08 08:37:27,reddit,number even multiple times single simply not abysmal portray first definitely not prison usually leisure areas street soccer basketball courts common even gyms equipped enough general gym goer dumbbells machines multi purpose halls used play badminton normally also wifi room come together subscribe one isp not like nothing bunks free time secondly not locked rooms free wander around not assume allowed use leisure facilities want go take walk breathe fresh air highly possible also shop allow buy groceries although talked prefer buying outside shops tend charge higher prices point conditions rooms generally rooms clean cleanliness top notch definitely well kept fine said cleanliness also directly dependent actions living room gone different rooms building rooms clean others baby cockroaches running around ventilation also usually not problem fans provided not broken sweat working rooms even worked return home work warm think gone residential houses conditions worse smelly messy horrible ventilation put simply yes residential areas ideal satisfactory sense clean areas alone want enjoy company others change living conditions ability decide clean want bunks yes aware companies not care welfare forced unliveable conditions safely say minority please not write things condition living areas know much especially not even rooms painting picture based false perception misguide public unfair companies bosses really take care

> SINGAPORE - Employers here will have to let the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) move their foreign workers to different dormitories or work at another company in need of manpower in order to get the foreign worker levy (FWL) rebates announced in last week's Fortitude Budget.

> In a statement on Sunday (May 31), MOM said that in view of the support given, employers must also continue paying the salaries of foreign workers who are unable to work due to the Covid-19 situation.

> ""In such cases, employers should work out mutually agreed salary and leave arrangements with the unions and workers.

> ""Foreign workers who are assigned to work full-time should be paid their prevailing salaries,"" said the ministry.

> Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, who is also Finance Minister, had announced on May 26 that the Government will extend the FWL waivers and rebates for up to two months, for businesses not allowed to resume operations after the circuit breaker period.

> The waiver will be 100 per cent in June, and 50 per cent in July, while the rebate will be $750 in June, and $375 in July.

> These apply to businesses not in the Ministry of Trade and Industry's permitted list on GoBusiness Portal, along with all businesses in construction, marine shipyard and process sectors.

> To receive the rebates, MOM said the employers will have to accept two conditions.

> First, they must allow MOM to move work permit holders and S Pass holders cleared of Covid-19 from existing dormitories to a cleared dormitory, to facilitate workers returning to work.

> Related Story Foreign worker levy waiver, rebates extended by up to 2 months for firms unable to resume work after circuit breaker

> Related Story Why Singapore cannot cut down on foreign workers the way other countries have

> ""Employers may be required to terminate the leases with their current dormitory operator to recontract with a new dormitory operator,"" said MOM.

> Second, the employers must allow MOM to second or transfer their workers to another company that needs workers, but whose own workers are in dormitories that have not been cleared.

> All employers must make an online acknowledgement of the conditions by June 10.

> ""This support will taper off as we ease out of the circuit breaker and restart our economy.

> ""Businesses that expect to restart later are encouraged to reassess their foreign manpower needs and adjust their workforce accordingly,"" MOM said.

688,"About 250 Indians, with nearly half of them staying in close contact in the dormitories for foreign workers, have tested positive for the coronavirus in Singapore, the Indian High Commission here said on Friday.Indian High Commissioner Jawed Ashraf told PTI that almost all of the Indians who have the disease are mostly stable or improving.He said that the about 250 Indian nationals, who are suffering from the disease, include some permanent residents.Of the infected Indians, nearly 50 per cent are from dormitories for foreign workers, which have emerged as the disease spreading points in the country.The first cases from the dormitories were reported on March 29, but the number of infections has climbed to 460, of which about 200 were confirmed on Thursday.As the country has ramped up aggressive testing in the dormitories, the numbers are expected to climb in the next few days.Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the COVID-19 task force, said coronavirus cases in the foreign worker dormitories will continue to rise in the coming days and perhaps even in the coming weeks or so.""But we do have a comprehensive strategy and measures are in place, and the agencies are now working round the clock to execute and implement them,"" The Straits Times quoted the Minister as saying on Friday.Noting that foreign workers will still be providing public services such as cleaning, Wong urged people not to be prejudiced against them.""It''s not because of a foreign worker being inherently of higher risk - the risk of infection for the rest of us in the population is the same, regardless of nationality, regardless of race,"" he stressed.Singapore authorities are working to improve the living conditions in dormitories and relocating workers in other accommodations, including empty Housing Development Board flats and Army facilities, according to local media reports.Meanwhile, Indian High Commissioner Ashraf said that the post-mortem report of a 32-year-old Indian man, who died on April 8, confirmed that he passed away because of a heart condition and not due to the COVID-19 as reported earlier.The deceased was advised to stay at home after he underwent the coronavirus test on April 7.As the international flights are suspended due to the lockdown in India, it would be difficult to immediately send back the deceased''s body, an informed source said, adding Singapore authorities are expected to speak to the deceased''s family.Singapore reported 287 cases of coronavirus on Thursday, taking the total of 1,910.

697,"Ex-Deputy Prime Ministers Tharman and Teo Chee Hean brought in to handle manpower matters -deputy-prime...r-matters/After Senior Ministers Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Teo Chee Hean were roped in to handle manpower matters like the jobs council and the foreign worker dormitories situation, some Singaporeans are speculating whether Manpower Minister Josephine Teo was given too big a portfolio for her to cope with.Mr Tharman and Mr Teo served as Singapore’s Deputy Prime Ministers from 2011 to 2019. The pair stepped down from their posts and became Senior Ministers on 1 May 2019, following a Cabinet reshuffle that was designed to give fourth-generation (4G) ministers more exposure and responsibilities so that they can better support the next Prime Minister who will come from their cohort.The Cabinet reshuffle saw the ruling People’s Action Party’s (PAP) 4G cohort accept several promotions that resulted in them leading two-thirds of the Government’s ministries. Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat kept his ministry but also succeeded Mr Tharman and Mr Teo as Singapore’s sole Deputy Prime Minister, giving rise to speculation that he is the ruling party’s Prime Minister designate.Besides Mr Tharman and Mr Teo, fellow veteran politician Lim Swee Say stepped down from his post as Manpower Minister and was succeeded by Josephine Teo, who became Singapore’s second female minister to helm a ministry after Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu.While Mr Tharman and Mr Teo seemed to take a backseat to allow the younger ministers to take charge, they have now taken on important responsibilities that pertain to manpower.Current DPM Heng Swee Keat tapped on Mr Tharman to chair the new National Jobs Council. Asserting that his predecessor has “both detailed knowledge and deep expertise in this issue” in his latest supplementary budget speech last month, Mr Heng revealed that the National Jobs Council will focus on creating jobs and helping workers build deep skills to stay employable in the challenging economy.Mr Teo was brought in to handle the foreign worker dormitories issue after COVID-19 outbreaks in the dorms ended up infecting over 33,567 workers and counting. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that Mr Teo is playing an advisory role in the Government’s inter agency task force to handle the situation in the dorms.The veteran politicians’ involvement in what are perceived as manpower matters has raised questions about the capabilities of Manpower Minister Josephine Teo.Mrs Teo was just recently under public scrutiny for the way she handled the COVID-19 outbreaks at the foreign worker dormitories. Some Singaporeans blamed the minister for allowing the COVID-19 situation to spiral out of control among migrant workers even though she was warned in advance that this might happen due to the workers’ overcrowded living conditions.When she was asked why she did not act early in implementing safe distancing measures in the dorms before the coronavirus infection spread uncontrolled, Mrs Teo did not apologise and instead blamed a lack of hindsight.Expressing a wish to “rewind the clock” to implement safe distancing measures in the dorms earlier, she told the local press: “If possible, I really wish to know at which stage the infection has already spread to community and migrant workers group? If time can be rewound, this is what I wish I could know.”Hi Dumbfark,please provide proper link lah u knnb xxx",1,2020-06-06 10:31:00,sgtalk,ex deputy prime ministers tharman teo chee hean brought handle manpower matters deputy prime r matters senior ministers tharman shanmugaratnam teo chee hean roped handle manpower matters like jobs council situation singaporeans speculating whether manpower minister josephine teo given big portfolio cope mr tharman mr teo served singapore deputy prime ministers 2011 2019 pair stepped posts became senior ministers 1 may 2019 following cabinet reshuffle designed give fourth generation 4g ministers exposure responsibilities better support next prime minister come cohort cabinet reshuffle saw ruling people action party pap 4g cohort accept several promotions resulted leading two thirds government ministries finance minister heng swee keat kept ministry also succeeded mr tharman mr teo singapore sole deputy prime minister giving rise speculation ruling party prime minister designate besides mr tharman mr teo fellow veteran politician lim swee say stepped post manpower minister succeeded josephine teo became singapore second female minister helm ministry minister culture community youth grace fu mr tharman mr teo seemed take backseat allow younger ministers take charge taken important responsibilities pertain manpower current dpm heng swee keat tapped mr tharman chair new national jobs council asserting predecessor detailed knowledge deep expertise issue latest supplementary budget speech last month mr heng revealed national jobs council focus creating jobs helping build deep skills stay employable challenging economy mr teo brought handle issue outbreaks ended infecting 33 567 counting prime minister lee hsien loong said mr teo playing advisory role government inter agency task force handle situation veteran politicians involvement perceived manpower matters raised questions capabilities manpower minister josephine teo mrs teo recently public scrutiny way handled outbreaks singaporeans blamed minister allowing situation spiral control among even though warned advance might happen due overcrowded living conditions asked not act early implementing safe distancing measures infection spread uncontrolled mrs teo not apologise instead blamed lack hindsight expressing wish rewind clock implement safe distancing measures earlier told local press possible really wish know stage infection already spread community group time rewound wish could know hi dumbfark please provide proper link u knnb xxx

831,"MASKS NOW COMPULSORY FOR ALL SINGAPOREANS WHEN THEY HEAD OUT  ...-wong-12640828SINGAPORE: It is now mandatory to wear a mask when stepping out of the house, with some exceptions, announced Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong on Tuesday (Apr 14). The mask-wearing requirement takes effect immediately, said Mr Wong, as he spoke at a press conference conducted by the multi-ministry task force tackling COVID-19. Individuals who are caught refusing to wear a mask will be fined S$300 on their first offence, while those who flout the rule a second time will be fined S$1,000. Egregious cases will be prosecuted in court, he added. Foreign residents caught breaching these rules might have their work passes or permanent resident status revoked.Mr Wong, who co-chairs the the task force with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, noted that the Government had updated its advisory on masks based on the ""latest medical and scientific advice and that the exercise to distribute reusable masks to Singaporeans was completed over the weekend. Now that we have distributed the mask to everyone and generally people have started to adjust to the new requirements or the advisory, we are making it mandatory for all, said Mr Wong.;The minute you leave your room, or you leave your house, you have to wear a mask when you go out.READ: Singapore's COVID-19 cases exceed 3,000 with 334 new infections; situation remains 'critical'Children below the age of two will not need to wear a mask based on medical experts recommendations on child safety, he said. As for adults, only those who are engaging in strenuous exercises like running and jogging do not have to wear a mask, but they will have to put it on once they stop exercising. Mr Wong also reiterated the need for them to maintain a safe distance from others when they are exercising. We are very happy that many Singaporeans and residents are cooperating and doing their part, and complying with these measures, said Mr Wong, noting that movement across the island has reduced significantly. With safe distancing ambassadors and enforcement officers hard at work on the ground, hotspots like wet markets, hawker centres and parks are generally now under control, he said.Most people are doing the right thing. There are a few who are not and they will be dealt with.Acknowledging that some people are finding it hard to adjust to the circuit breaker measures and are suffering from cabin fever, Mr Wong said the Government has had to reject many appeals for activities. We cannot let up at this stage. These are still early days and we have at least another three more weeks to go. So we have to double down on our efforts and just stay at home. About 20 per cent of the workforce comprises essential workers and continue to travel to their workplaces, Mr Wong noted.

835,"> # Over 10m meals served to foreign workers confined to dorms

> More than 10 million meals have been served to foreign workers since some purpose-built dormitories went into lockdown, with food caterers seeking to address concerns raised about their quality and quantity.

> This is no mean feat, as noted by Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad, who said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that the inter-agency task force set up to support the workers would have served over 10 million meals to those in the purpose-built dorms by this weekend.

> He said there are 34 professional caterers providing meals to about 200,000 workers - akin to catering for the whole of Ang Mo Kio GRC. The Government is footing the bill for all meals in purpose-built dorms. It is not clear how much the caterers are charging but one of them, Neo Group, said it charges only for ingredients and labour costs.

> Teething issues early on sparked criticism about the quality, quantity and the type of cuisine served up but this has improved, said Mr Zaqy.

> He told The Straits Times that these issues stemmed from logistics challenges generated by the sheer number of residents in the dorms.

> The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is now ensuring that meals are delivered to residents within 30 minutes of their arrival at the dorms. Tests are also being done with workers from different countries to ensure that the food suits their tastes.

> ""Some of them prefer a certain variety of rice, like ponni rice, and requested the rice to be cooked for a longer period of time,"" said Mr Zaqy.

> The first catered meal given to Bangladeshi Ahammad Md Ali, 27, when his dorm was gazetted as an isolation area and locked down about two weeks ago was a bag of rice and Indian curry.

> He was happy to chomp it down but some of his Bangladeshi friends at Westlite Mandai dormitory found it harder to stomach.

> ""The food is OK to 'makan' (eat in Malay), but Bangladeshi food is different from Indian food. Some of us are only used to Bangladeshi food,"" said Mr Ahammad, a safety coordinator who has worked here for seven years.

> ""Bangladeshi food is less salty. We gave feedback, the next day they sent Bangladeshi food,"" he added, noting that he usually cooks his own meals in the dorm.

> The Covid-19 outbreak has resulted in about 300,000 workers having their movements restricted due to quarantine or stay-home notices, prompting the authorities, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and employers to step in to ensure that daily needs are met.

> ACTION AFTER FEEDBACK The food is OK to 'makan' (eat in Malay), but Bangladeshi food is different from Indian food, some of us are only used to Bangladeshi food... Bangladeshi food is less salty. We gave feedback, the next day they sent Bangladeshi food. BANGLADESHI AHAMMAD MD ALI, a safety coordinator who has worked here for seven years.

> Meanwhile, the Covid-19 Migrant Support Coalition comprising NGOs and ground-up initiatives has provided around 17,000 meals to workers in factory-converted dorms and other types of accommodation over the past three weeks.

> Migrant Workers' Centre chairman Yeo Guat Kwang said in this ""unprecedented situation"" everyone, including workers and caterers, has had to adapt and adjust: ""It's understandable the workers are upset at the restrictions.

> ""Just like you and me, it's hard to give up choice and habits, such as being able to cook for yourself.""

> Indian construction worker Kandan Gopinath, 41, said the food in his PPT Lodge 1A dorm has improved over the past week.

> When the dorm was gazetted as an isolation area on April 19, the meals were bland as they lacked the spices he was used to.

> ""The rice was half-cooked and there were only boiled vegetables and a little curry,"" he said, adding that things changed after he raised the issue with the dorm operator.

> ""These few days, the food has been good, like fish curry. But sometimes it can be very oily,"" he said.

> Similarly, caterers who have taken on the task of feeding the hundreds of thousands of workers have had to adapt to the diets of at least six different nationalities.

> Catering Solutions, which provides food for five purpose-built dorms, has ramped up its production from 20,000 meals a day to almost 70,000 in the past few weeks, said director Shanmugam Ganesan.

> It had previously been catering for workers at Jurong Shipyard and Sembcorp Marine in Tuas, but providing for a bigger group has seen it tweaking its menus according to workers' feedback. It provides Chinese, Indian, Bangladeshi and Punjabi dishes.

> ""We adjusted the kinds of fish, vegetables and portioning of curries,"" said Mr Shanmugam, adding that extra portions of rice are also prepared just in case.

> Catering Solutions has hired 60 workers to add to its workforce of 100 and tapped technology - it has a number of chapati-making machines - to increase production.

> Its kitchens are working 24 hours a day, up from 18, to provide pre-dawn meals for Muslim workers in the dorms during Ramadan.

> Mr Ong Yong Shun, an MOM officer deployed at Changi Lodge 2, acknowledged the initial dissatisfaction about the meals but said feedback has led to an improvement in quality. Forward assurance support, or ""Fast"", teams stationed in the dorms have been having the same meals as the workers, he said.

> ""This ensures first-hand knowledge of the quality of every meal served and enables us to be proactive in feedback given,"" he said.

836,"MOH released a press release today on Scaling up of testing for COVID-19.-highligh...vid-19-testing 27TH APR 20201. Testing is a critical enabler of our fight against COVID-19. The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has been steadily building up our national capacity to conduct tests for COVID-19. From an average of 2,900 tests per day in early April, we are now able to conduct more than 8,000 tests per day. To date, Singapore has tested about 2,100 per 100,000 persons. In comparison, the US has tested 1,600 per 100,000 and the UK 1,000 per 100,000. The higher intensity of testing allows us to pick up far more cases than many other countries.2. We have taken steps to continue building up our testing capacity over the coming weeks and months. Even as we do so, we will continue to prioritise our existing testing capacity based on public health considerations.Testing for Diagnosis and Surveillance3. Testing is used for three key purposes. First, for diagnosis in order to provide the appropriate treatment early for persons who are unwell. Second, for active case finding in order to identity infected individuals early and isolate them. Contact tracing around confirmed cases allows us to ring-fence any clusters, and prevent further transmissions. And third, for surveillance purposes, in particular of groups at higher risk of contracting or transmitting the disease.4. Such testing is done systematically across our hospitals, polyclinics and general practitioner clinics. We test high risk groups showing symptoms of acute respiratory infection (ARI), such as those who are close contacts of confirmed cases, those with travel history, patients already diagnosed with pneumonia, or patients with prolonged ARI. We also conduct testing as a means of general surveillance to detect signs of community spread and to pick up unlinked cases.Testing in the Migrant Worker Dormitories5. A similar testing strategy is applied to our migrant worker community, including those living in dormitories. The Ministry of Health (MOH) has been testing close to 3,000 migrant workers residing at the dormitories every day, and will continue to do more tests. Many of these workers showed no symptoms when they were tested. In most countries, people who are asymptomatic are not tested. To date, more than 21,000 migrant workers living in dormitories have been tested. This means that we have tested about one in 15 workers in dormitories (or 6,500 per 100,000), far higher than the testing rates seen in countries like South Korea (one in 90, or 1,100 per 100,000).6. This aggressive testing regime enables us to determine the extent of infection in the dormitories. Those who are confirmed with COVID-19 infection will be reported in the daily tally of newly confirmed cases. We started with the dormitories with a higher incidence of infections, and are continuing to test the workers in the other dormitories.7. Due to the need to prioritise, we are not be able to test all in the dormitories at one go. But if any worker were to report sick or show ARI symptoms, we will immediately pull aside and isolate the worker from his room-mates, and ensure that he receives the necessary medical care. This allows us to provide medical care quickly to the symptomatic foreign workers, and to ensure that those with higher risk factors or have more severe illnesses are transferred to receive care at our healthcare institutions.8. One urgent priority is to test migrant workers who have moved out of the dormitories but are continuing to work in essential services. This is to reduce the risk of transmission in workplaces and to the wider community.Testing for Protection and Monitoring9. Finally, we are doing more tests to protect vulnerable groups. For instance, we are testing the staff at nursing homes where there is close contact with seniors, as well as healthcare workers and frontline officers who have regular contact with confirmed cases. This will help to ensure that they continue to stay healthy, and receive medical treatment promptly if required.10. As more testing capacity is brought on-stream, we will gradually expand testing to the wider pool of workers in order to ensure the continuity of critical functions and services. This is important, as it will also enable us to progressively resume economic activities beyond the circuit breaker period.Holistic Strategy11. While testing is important, it has to be part of a broader strategy to fight COVID-19. Testing alone cannot substitute for other important measures like safe distancing and infection control. Individual responsibility in upholding good personal hygiene, minimising contact, and seeing a doctor immediately when sick are all critical aspects of the overall strategy. Together, we can slow down transmissions, beat the virus, and emerge stronger after the crisis.MINISTRY OF HEALTH27 APRIL 2020",1,2020-04-27 21:28:00,hardwarezone,moh released press release today scaling testing highligh vid testing 27th apr 20201 testing critical enabler fight against multi ministry taskforce steadily building national capacity conduct tests average 2 900 tests per day early april able conduct 8 000 tests per day date singapore tested 2 100 per 100 000 persons comparison us tested 1 600 per 100 000 uk 1 000 per 100 000 higher intensity testing allows us pick far many countries 2 taken steps continue building testing capacity coming weeks months even continue prioritise existing testing capacity based public health considerations testing diagnosis surveillance3 testing used three key purposes first diagnosis order provide appropriate treatment early persons unwell second active case finding order identity infected individuals early isolate contact tracing around confirmed allows us ring fence clusters prevent transmissions third surveillance purposes particular groups higher risk contracting transmitting disease 4 testing done systematically across hospitals polyclinics general practitioner clinics test high risk groups showing symptoms acute respiratory infection ari close contacts confirmed travel history patients already diagnosed pneumonia patients prolonged ari also conduct testing means general surveillance detect signs community spread pick unlinked testing dormitories5 similar testing strategy applied community including living ministry health moh testing close 3 000 residing every day continue tests many showed no symptoms tested countries people asymptomatic not tested date 21 000 living tested means tested one 15 6 500 per 100 000 far higher testing rates seen countries like south korea one 90 1 100 per 100 000 6 aggressive testing regime enables us determine extent infection confirmed infection reported daily tally newly confirmed started higher incidence infections continuing test 7 due need prioritise not able test one go report sick show ari symptoms immediately pull aside isolate room mates ensure receives necessary medical care allows us provide medical care quickly symptomatic ensure higher risk factors severe illnesses transferred receive care healthcare institutions 8 one urgent priority test moved continuing work essential services reduce risk transmission workplaces wider community testing protection monitoring9 finally tests protect vulnerable groups instance testing staff nursing homes close contact seniors well healthcare frontline officers regular contact confirmed help ensure continue stay healthy receive medical treatment promptly required 10 testing capacity brought stream gradually expand testing wider pool order ensure continuity critical functions services important also enable us progressively resume economic activities beyond circuit breaker period holistic strategy11 testing important part broader strategy fight testing alone cannot substitute important measures like safe distancing infection control individual responsibility upholding good personal hygiene minimising contact seeing doctor immediately sick critical aspects overall strategy together slow transmissions beat emerge stronger crisis ministry health27 april 2020

> If deemed feasible, the two cruise ships may be used to complement other interim facilities such as Singapore Armed Forces military camps and vacant Housing Board blocks that have been refurbished to house healthy workers.

> By reducing numbers of workers in existing dormitories, health measures can be implemented more effectively, said the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) in a media statement on Friday (April 17) morning.

> Cruise ships are being considered for use as temporary housing as they have readily available rooms and en-suite toilets to minimise person-to-person contact, added STB.

> SuperStar Gemini, which arrived from Hong Kong on Friday, is berthed at Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore. SuperStar Aquarius may be activated for assessment at a later date.

> If deemed suitable, the two ships may accommodate up to 2,000 foreign workers in total.

> STB said that ""if activated, every effort will be made to uphold the health, welfare and security of foreign workers on board the ship, where they will be expected to observe the highest standards of safe distancing at all times"".

> Foreign workers would also be allowed scheduled outdoor time on the vessels and would be provided with wireless Internet access.

> Related Story Coronavirus: 3 more foreign worker dormitories declared isolation areas

> Related Story Coronavirus: Floating facilities ready to house healthy foreign workers

> While the spread of the coronavirus in the wider community has held steady over the past two weeks, the number of cases linked to foreign workers in dormitories has risen exponentially.

> As of Friday morning, the total number of foreign workers linked to dorms who have tested positive for Covid-19 is 2,689, which is about 60 per cent of all Singapore's cases.

> There are now a total of 12 dormitories declared as isolation areas where workers at these lodgings must be quarantined in their rooms for 14 days.

Have you seen how migrant workers are housed and transported? They're treated like  woodpile. Can you imagine the safety and hygiene standards in these dormitories? What about the trucks on which scores of workers are transported without seat belts and harnesses? It's obvious that the lives of these workers *matter less* than your average Singaporean person.

The western media looks at the Middle-east and Singapore with entirely different lenses (for pretty obvious reasons); that is precisely why we've been able to avoid the public eye. The sign of any developed economy is one where *unskilled* labourers (your welders, fitters and electricians) earn a good healthy income. For instance, a lolly-pop man in Australia can earn upto a 120k AUD (factor in a 30-40% tax on that; that's still a take home of about 70-80k); this is why these roles are taken up by Australians (and not folks from South Asia or China). On the flip side, your educated class wouldn't be earning wages that are too dissimilar either. In other words, the income gap is quite narrow and regulated. This is a tell-tale sign of a good, healthy, developed economy; and it's a far cry from what we see here in Singapore.",2,2020-05-02 18:41:32,reddit,feel views quite myopic seen housed transported treated like woodpile imagine safety hygiene standards trucks scores transported without seat belts harnesses obvious lives matter less average singaporean person western media looks middle east singapore entirely different lenses pretty obvious reasons precisely able avoid public eye sign developed economy one unskilled labourers welders fitters electricians earn good healthy income instance lolly pop man australia earn upto 120k aud factor 30 40 tax still take home 70 80k roles taken australians not folks south asia china flip side educated class wouldn earning wages dissimilar either words income gap quite narrow regulated tell tale sign good healthy developed economy far cry see singapore

956,"It's not that the govt didn't take action until it was too late, they did, just not effectively in the dorms.

Additionally, policies from a previous epidemic can be used, and were used for the community and country, in preparation for the covid, but there was a sense of over-reliance on what was done for SARS, that some areas were overlooked. SARS didn't have widespread community transmission, but Covid-19 did.

So in this aspect, the government had to think of the possibilities in which the Covid-19 situation could get worse, and plan policies from there. But because at each escalation of the situation, things were changing quite fast, they didn't evaluate properly (or at least that's what we think) the consequences of each action.

The govt isn't wholly incompetent in the handling of epidemics, in fact, we did some necessary steps, such as the banning of flights, but the parts where they didn't, it was a case of wrong timing, and various other factors. 

For us to discuss the incompetence, we also have to realise the amount of available information at that point in time when they planned a policy. We must realise also that when we are discussing a past event, we already know the consequences of the policies. 

They did do quite a good job imo, outside the dormitories, with some errors that could have been prevented, but in relation to the dorms, it can be said that what could have been done probably wasn't to expectations.",2,2020-05-30 18:17:42,reddit,not govt didn take action late not effectively additionally policies previous epidemic used used community country preparation sense reliance done sars areas overlooked sars didn widespread community transmission aspect government think possibilities situation could get worse plan policies escalation situation things changing quite fast didn evaluate properly least think consequences action govt wholly incompetent handling epidemics fact necessary steps banning flights parts didn case wrong timing various factors us discuss incompetence also realise amount available information point time planned policy must realise also discussing past event already know consequences policies quite good job imo outside errors could prevented relation said could done probably wasn expectations

Second, I asked you a question. How is that creating a strawman? Are you implying you had the intention to create a misleading train of thought? Or are you trying to create a straw man for yourself now? If dorm operators following social distancing protocols, then each building and each storey should have been partitioned accordingly. That makes it practically no different from us living in our own HDB and only venturing out for necessities. So are you saying:

1) Dorm operators all ignore the rules?
2) The migrant workers are at fault for ignoring the rules?
3) You are privy to some other information that you are not reporting to assist the authorities?

Again, that final statement is a strawman. I’ve never disagreed the dorm issue isn’t worth government attention.

We can do both. The dorms aren't going to be a similar transmission environment to the rest of society and it's disingenuous to fold them into the other cases, just as it was disingenuous to fold the Diamond Princess into Japan's cases. 

It's good that we're seeing a drop in local transmission. Hopefully this continues. Hopefully our measures are working. It's bad that we're seeing a lot of cases emerging from the dormitories. There's definitely a great deal of infection risk there, so hopefully the mitigation factors (e.g. transferring those who test negative out) will start kicking in soon.

At the time, We also didn't know much about the virus. About the transmission and everything. 

So, at the time, the govt made a call. To say that only wear masks if you are sick. Which at the time, with the information we had, made sense. 

Given the information we had, I think it was the right decision?

995,"I think you’re looking at it from just one perspective of healthcare but you need to remember that the government has the uphill task of balancing all sectors of the country. It’s how to balance everything with minimal effect to daily lives or minimal effort for recovery after all is over because damage is inevitable. It’s definitely not an easy task, and many people seem to glance over this point when they criticize the policies enacted. 

Sure, it’s easy to say close schools and work places. But that would have downstream effects which you need to plan for very carefully and prepare for. I think that secretly, they have been ramping up the efforts in the background without telling us exactly what they’re doing. For example the recently abandoned precinct near my place due to en bloc is now being refitted with many new facilities, with rumors that it will be a quarantine/SHN center. There’s absolutely no news about that, but residents are seeing the work done and the urgency of speed that it’s done at, it’s not hard to put two and two together.  Also when you start to look at everything from multiple angles you really start to fathom how critically complex the whole response and coordination is and that’s when you realize that the government has been many steps ahead of where they are. This is not something many people come to realize in the midst of of their criticism. So it’s easy to stand there and say “they should have done this and that” in hindsight, but it’s all people speaking from the limited knowledge they have. Granted, I do not know much too but I can understand and see why the policies and implemented the way they are. 

And to blame the government on such issues they are receiving heat for, it’s not all fair to them. At the end of the day, the government makes the policies but it is the people who enact them. We wouldn’t have needed to reach the stage of a CB if the common folk took social distancing more seriously. Look at the queues at ikea, supermarkets, etc even after the CB is announced.

996,"Ok first of I'd like to say that I'm not intentionally being edgy. And I'm fine with using my real name because I haven't said anything that I'm ashamed of, and if anyone tries to doxx me, they automatically lose all moral high ground. Let me rephrase what I'm trying to say here: the workers should be given the best possible conditions that we can afford. Key phrase: that we can afford. And when I say ""take office first"", I don't literally mean that you have to assume an official position in order to try and enact change, I'm asking you to look at it from a different perspective. It's very easy to criticise but if you were actually there on the ground trying to recruit volunteers, distribute medical supplies, and relocate healthcare workers, I think you would better appreciate what is already being done. I'm not saying it's perfect, not by a long shot, but I'm saying that I trust the government is doing all that it can within a reasonable capacity. I do agree that there are and will continue to be flaws, lapses and slip-ups, but I also trust that such issues will be addressed in the fastest and best possible way. I mean already in that article it outlined how efforts were being made to improve living conditions: ""cleanliness and hygiene being stepped up""', ""sickbays being scaled up"", ""thousands of workers moving to army camps, floating hotels and empty HDBs"" to ease up on the cramped conditions... I mean it doesn't really sound a lot like Omelas to me, sounds like they're actually trying hard to make it better.

Second point about hierarchy. I maintain that the Singpore government's first priority rightfully is, and always should be, Singaporean nationals. Does this mean that we should simply neglect everyone else and leave them to die in crowded conditions? Of course not! But consider if we quarantined all 20,000 workers identically to how we have been quarantining our own citizens. Our systems would be completely overwhelmed in no time. It would leave no margin whatsoever for future infections, many of whom would be nationals. If we had the space and the resources then of course they should give workers the same conditions, but sadly this isn't the case. I just want to put across the point that when we have such limited resources, no matter what couse of action you take there is always going to be someone who loses out.

Okay, as for the bit where you said this isn't just for the government, it's for everyone, I agree with you almost completely. However, it is incredibly difficult to see any kind of change coming about in the immediate future. And frankly, you should be the change that you want to see. If you're really passionate about this, then you should volunteer to cook/clean for the workers. You might say, ""oh I'm busy, I still have to work from home, etc etc"", all of which is perfectly understandable. Then maybe you should consider that this is the same situatiom which other Singaporeans are in. Now again, I'm not saying, ""you must be a volunteer, then only you can talk about how people should be more sympathetic"", I'm just saying that if everyone expressed concern online but never enacted any real change, people would be a lot more caring for our workers but the actual workers' situations would not improve.",2,2020-04-10 10:39:08,reddit,ok first like say not intentionally edgy fine using real name said anything ashamed anyone tries doxx automatically lose moral high ground let rephrase trying say should given best possible conditions afford key phrase afford say take office first literally mean assume official position order try enact change asking look different perspective easy criticise actually ground trying recruit volunteers distribute medical supplies relocate healthcare think would better appreciate already done not saying perfect not long shot saying trust government within reasonable capacity agree continue flaws lapses slip ups also trust issues addressed fastest best possible way mean already article outlined efforts made improve living conditions cleanliness hygiene stepped sickbays scaled thousands moving army camps floating hotels empty hdbs ease cramped conditions mean doesn really sound lot like omelas sounds like actually trying hard make better second point hierarchy maintain singpore government first priority rightfully always should singaporean nationals mean should simply neglect everyone else leave die crowded conditions course not consider quarantined 20 000 identically quarantining citizens systems would completely overwhelmed no time would leave no margin whatsoever future infections many would nationals space resources course should give conditions sadly case want put across point limited resources no matter couse action take always going someone loses okay bit said government everyone agree almost completely however incredibly difficult see kind change coming immediate future frankly should change want see really passionate should volunteer cook clean might say oh busy still work home etc etc perfectly understandable maybe should consider situatiom singaporeans not saying must volunteer talk people should sympathetic saying everyone expressed concern online never enacted real change people would lot caring actual situations would not improve
