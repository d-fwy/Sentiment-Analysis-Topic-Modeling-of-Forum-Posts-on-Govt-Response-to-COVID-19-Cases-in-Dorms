0,There is no new cluster beside the dorm for two days..,-0.06818181818181818
1,">For consistency and accuracy, it could be easier to use data from the new MOH Situation Report which separates into Dorm, non-Dorm foreigners and Citizen/PR.

I think they only count those from the named dorm clusters into ""Dorm"". So those who are either linked to construction sites or who live in non-cluster dorms get categorized as ""Linked to Other Clusters"" or ""Pending Investigations"" respectively.

So the MOH situation report for 28-3 to 10-4 LTP holders has 545 linked to dorm clusters, 126 linked to other clusters, and 141 pending investigations. Whereas my estimate for the same time period is 702 dorm/construction-related.

The reason I make these graphs is that there are really 2 separate COVID problems in Singapore. Circuit Breaker can slow down the growth of the cases in the general public. But other than stopping work at construction sites, Circuit Breaker doesn't help the dorm/construction site problem. The dorm/construction site problem has to be tackled by improving the living conditions of these workers, testing them, separating the sick from the well. And conversely, issues of way too many people ""exercising"", eating at hawker centres, sneakily meeting up etc only affect the non-dorm problem. 

And yes, the testing situation is worrisome. I do not know how they are prioritizing the tests. And it would be political suicide for MOH to admit that they are either prioritizing SC/PR cases first (patriotism) or the dorm workers (because it is more urgent to separate the sick in cramped conditions).",-0.024319985569985575

3,"I work nearby to the Westlite and Toh Guan Dorms. 

After the initial reports of Westlite having covid cases, I saw they were still open and operating as usual, even all the food stalls and the provision shop there. I was rather surprised they didn't try to isolate the situation earlier. 

I understand that maybe they couldn't just put everyone there under SHN immediately because of the financial implications, but I did wonder why they still allowed the workers to still congregate at the eating place and they also allowed the provision shop stay open. I didn't see any sanitizing stuff going on myself, but to be fair I have been telecommuting for most of the week so they may have done it without me seeing it.

Now after there are so many more cases, they decided to 'lock down' the place. And it also spread to Toh Guan Dormitory which is across the road and a couple units down.

I'm quite frustrated that something wasn't done earlier.",0.06925925925925923

12,"I feel that your views are quite myopic.

Have you seen how migrant workers are housed and transported? They're treated like  woodpile. Can you imagine the safety and hygiene standards in these dormitories? What about the trucks on which scores of workers are transported without seat belts and harnesses? It's obvious that the lives of these workers *matter less* than your average Singaporean person.

The western media looks at the Middle-east and Singapore with entirely different lenses (for pretty obvious reasons); that is precisely why we've been able to avoid the public eye. The sign of any developed economy is one where *unskilled* labourers (your welders, fitters and electricians) earn a good healthy income. For instance, a lolly-pop man in Australia can earn upto a 120k AUD (factor in a 30-40% tax on that; that's still a take home of about 70-80k); this is why these roles are taken up by Australians (and not folks from South Asia or China). On the flip side, your educated class wouldn't be earning wages that are too dissimilar either. In other words, the income gap is quite narrow and regulated. This is a tell-tale sign of a good, healthy, developed economy; and it's a far cry from what we see here in Singapore.",0.16885964912280702

57,"There are more than 40,000 Malaysians still in Singapore and the Malaysian state of Johor hopes that Singapore will make exemptions for them to be tested for Covid-19 before they are allowed to return to the state.More Malaysian workers are making their way back from Singapore after the Republic began implementing stricter measures to address the pandemic under a period known as the ""circuit breaker"". The measures which began on April 7 and will go on until May 4 have seen most workplaces and schools closed in order to reduce the risk of infections.Currently, Malaysians who test negative in Singapore will be able to go home and be quarantined there, while those without any certification or prior testing will be required to undergo compulsory 14-day quarantine at one of the government centres statewide.Johor Mentri Besar Hasni Mohammad said the state was working with the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the matter with their counterpart in Singapore given that the city-state presently does not conduct Covid-19 tests unless a person has showed symptoms.Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia Vanu Gopala Menon previously said there was currently no requirement by the Singapore government to provide random Covid-19 tests for foreign workers while Singapore's Ministry of Health has said that Covid-19 testing is only performed when clinically indicated, for patients and their close contacts.""That means a Malaysian can't get the test done in Singapore unless they are symptomatic, "" Datuk Hasni said in an interview in the Johor district of Iskandar Puteri.""We hope Singapore will allow for some exemptions so that Malaysians who want to return can get this test done at its clinics or hospitals, "" he said.Hasni said he was confident that the matter would be discussed through the Malaysia-Singapore Special Working Committee on Covid-19 for a solution to be reached.He said since Malaysia implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) on March 18 to curb the coronavirus, it has resolved certain issues, including easing the movement of cargo, essential and non-essential items between both countries as well as accommodation for Malaysian workers in Singapore.""The government will not stop Malaysians returning from Singapore and I can assure them that our frontliners have taken all the necessary steps and procedures at our border, "" he said.Hasni urged returning Malaysians to give their full cooperation to the frontliners conducting the necessary screening and testing at the checkpoints.On the number of Malaysians returning from Singapore after the island republic started its own measures to curb the spread of the virus, Hasni said the biggest influx was registered on April 3 with some 3,400 people. ""Since then there have been between 500 and 600 Malaysians coming back per day and we have been able to cope with the numbers, "" he added.-they-returnjust tell them all healthy and get them home to malaysia.",0.12941391941391941

Additionally, policies from a previous epidemic can be used, and were used for the community and country, in preparation for the covid, but there was a sense of over-reliance on what was done for SARS, that some areas were overlooked. SARS didn't have widespread community transmission, but Covid-19 did.

So in this aspect, the government had to think of the possibilities in which the Covid-19 situation could get worse, and plan policies from there. But because at each escalation of the situation, things were changing quite fast, they didn't evaluate properly (or at least that's what we think) the consequences of each action.

The govt isn't wholly incompetent in the handling of epidemics, in fact, we did some necessary steps, such as the banning of flights, but the parts where they didn't, it was a case of wrong timing, and various other factors. 

For us to discuss the incompetence, we also have to realise the amount of available information at that point in time when they planned a policy. We must realise also that when we are discussing a past event, we already know the consequences of the policies.

Genuinely, would you invest in any sort of savings plan that gives less margin than another savings plan, all else being equal? 

You've not answered any of my questions on how this can be enforced when it comes to future constructions and developments. Yes the cost is distributed across society. How would the government enforce this cost? Increase levies and taxes against these construction and development companies? Create a price freeze that is pegged against some arbitrary or historical figure? On top of everything else, there are multiple parties involved. Dormitory owners, construction contractors, and property developers. If you force dormitory owners to absorb the cost of having more spacious lodgings and prohibit them from passing part or all of the additional cost to the construction contractor, then they will either take their money and go somewhere else, or convert their dormitories for more affluent clientele like foreign students, or pass on the cost to recruitment agents in the foreign worker's home countries, which are out of Singaporean jurisdiction. Or just charge the foreign workers more. The same sort of cycle will persist if you put the costs on the contractors, or the developers. 

If somehow these companies are able to be forced to absorb these costs and not pass them on to the consumer, then their P&L numbers go up, making them less attractive to investors, and the industry just doesn't grow. Without this growth, they will probably start cutting costs, beginning with poorer quality work or retrenchment of staff. So will they not be allowed to lay off staff as well?",0.12579365079365082

456,">but its so disingenuous to separate the local and foreign cases and say ""hey local cases gone down, we did it boys!"" like it or not these foreign workers are part of the sg community and 1 more case is 1 more case no matter what, and it brings greater risk to the community. so it's not ""14 local cases today"", it's 942 new cases.

We can do both. The dorms aren't going to be a similar transmission environment to the rest of society and it's disingenuous to fold them into the other cases, just as it was disingenuous to fold the Diamond Princess into Japan's cases. 

It's good that we're seeing a drop in local transmission. Hopefully this continues. Hopefully our measures are working. It's bad that we're seeing a lot of cases emerging from the dormitories. There's definitely a great deal of infection risk there, so hopefully the mitigation factors (e.g. transferring those who test negative out) will start kicking in soon. Some of this might be a function of the fact that they have been focusing fire on testing in the dormitories. Hopefully they all get the care they need.",0.09217171717171718

Back when it first started some people already predicted it was going to be bad and were calling for stronger measures. But the experts and everybody else just ignored it and you would get laughed at for wearing masks.

Now there are signs it is not as deadly as we thought and that contact tracing and social distancing seems to be sort of good enough to keep growth low and again there is no room for consideration.

488,"Yes definitely the dorm operators are the ones at fault for not doing proper upkeep of the premises. But sadly, you know how it is here in Sg, they’re just gonna keep with the status quo until the Govt slaps them with a warning. Cos even if the migrant workers or advocates sound out to the dorm’s building management, nothing happens. Which is why most of those who voice out about this issue (as well as other issues relating to migrant workers) direct it towards the Govt.

It’s just like how at least 10 (or more) years ago, companies that employ just a small number of foreign workers used to rent an entire HDB unit for their workers, and such “dorms” were often overcrowded as well, until HDB set down the maximum occupancy for each unit (no matter 3/4 room or bigger) to be 6. 

Back then, most worker dorms around were built and managed by the employers, usually large companies that employ a lot of workers, such as SembCorp, Keppel shipyard, etc. Those dorms usually have more amenities & facilities and generally offer a better living environment (but still cannot compare to SAF bunks la).

Still, I was watching CNA this morning, and the part mentioned in yesterday's CNA report that due to this new nomenclature, possibly hundred of clinically diagnosed cases in the dorms were left out from confirmed cases tally, was not mentioned at all. The only time it was mentioned in passing was in Prof Dale Fisher's interview where he'd said these clinically diagnosed cases should be included in the final tally for sake of being honest or transparency.
