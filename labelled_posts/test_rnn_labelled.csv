110,"Here are some things to think about:

1. The top brass (around 3pax) takes a lot of pay (a few million annually per person). The level below takes around a few hundred thousand to half a million per person.
2. Clearly they can afford to take a paycut (just for reference, around 2% is standard for downturns) to treat their workers just a bit better (eg cater better food, etc).
3. The question is why don't they do it?
4. It's because individuals in the company have to overcome the inertia of the many parties involved in order to even raise such a decision. Businesses are not dictatorships. 
5. In other words, there needs to be a convincing enough impetus. A business case for doing so, if you will. If not, a convincing reason beyond ""some people online are making noise"". (eg New blood in the leadership who wants to ""shake things up"")
6. Elsewhere, this comes in the form of union pressure or customer dollar votes (which are not applicable to this industry because the contractors are B2B, so laypeople opinions don't impact them)
7. Governments' hands are also tied (you might doubt this, but it's true). They can provide a slight 'nudge' in the form of regulations. BUT it needs to be quantifiable and objective to avoid loopholes and setting a bad precedent.
8. However, when a concept is inherently debatable, there will be endless protests from business owners who will just seek to muddy the waters. eg. How do you create a compelling case for why one definition of ""decent living conditions"" is the best definition?

At the end of the day, government interference in the free market is always a carefully calculated decision, because there are more factors at play than the layperson would often care to consider.",2020-05-19 01:02:51,reddit,things think 1 top brass around 3pax takes lot pay million annually per person level takes around hundred thousand half million per person 2 clearly afford take paycut reference around 2 standard downturns treat bit better eg cater better food etc 3 question 4 individuals company overcome inertia many parties involved order even raise decision businesses not dictatorships 5 words needs convincing enough impetus business case not convincing reason beyond people online making noise eg new blood leadership wants shake things 6 elsewhere comes form union pressure customer dollar votes not applicable industry contractors b2b laypeople opinions impact 7 governments hands also tied might doubt true provide slight nudge form regulations needs quantifiable objective avoid loopholes setting bad precedent 8 however concept inherently debatable endless protests business owners seek muddy waters eg create compelling case one definition decent living conditions best definition end day government interference free market always carefully calculated decision factors play layperson would often care consider,1.0

141,"> # COVID-19: 24 foreign workers permanently banned for violations of circuit breaker measures

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has revoked the work passes of 24 holders and permanently banned them from working in Singapore for flouting circuit breaker measures put in place to curb the spread of COVID-19.

> In a media release on Monday, MOM said it stepped up inspections at factory-converted dormitories to ensure that living conditions are acceptable, and that the well-being of the dorm residents are taken care of.

> MOM officers also checked that the dorm operators and employers adhere to the enhanced safe distancing measures. Among these measures are ensuring that employees stay in their rooms as much as possible, minimise interactions with those not living in the same room and leave the premises only if they need to purchase essential goods and services. 

> “Despite past enforcements carried out in the vicinity of Tuas View Square, our inspectors found 24 work pass holders eating, drinking, and gathering in groups. To send a clear signal of the seriousness of the offense, MOM has decided to revoke all 24 work passes and permanently barred the individuals from working in Singapore,” MOM said.

> At least 17 COVID-19 clusters linked to foreign worker dormitories have been identified thus far, including the largest cluster at S11 Dormitory@Punggol, which is linked to 365 cases.

> Eight such dorms have been gazetted as isolation areas, including the newly confirmed cluster at Acacia Lodge and Cochrane Lodge II.

> Between Saturday and Monday, MOM officers inspected over 600 dorms at Sungei Kadut, Tuas and other locations across Singapore. The vast majority of the dorms had instituted safe distancing measures and health checks for their residents. 

> Minor lapses were found in 57 dorms, with the most prevalent issue being a lack of sickbays and isolation areas. The cleanliness levels of some of these dorms were also found to be “unacceptable”, MOM said.

> MOM will complete the inspections of the remaining 600 dorms in the next two days. 

> Separately, MOM issued an additional advisory to employers of foreign workers living in the dorms, and other living arrangements on Monday to remind their employees to observe the safe distancing measures.

> Employers are reminded to continue to pay the salaries of their workers promptly and look after their well-being during the circuit breaker period. MOM said it will not hesitate to revoke the work pass privileges of errant employers.

147,"Nice opinion, but this is literally a slap on the wrist. For companies, these construction workers are expendable. They get injured in the workplace, they get shipped back to their home countries after patching them up. You think a fine + bills is a ""wake up call"". Nah, it's just a ""one-off expense"", ""we got caught fine"", basically a gamble for them. The calculations for them is such that they can mistreat them and still be in the green (cos you know, these events don't happen every year).

They will just gladly pay up and mistreat them again. And you know what? They won't follow, they will try to bend the rules further (like people who flout SHN/CB rules) and that will result in worse conditions for the workers. For instance, if a worker gets XYZ communicable disease (assuming it isn't hard to test like COVID-19), instead of reporting, they will just quickly ship that worker back to this hometown on the grounds of ""slacking off at work"". There, we mitigated the spread, absolutely nothing happened in our dorms! Bring in the next healthy batch of workers.

What we need isn't punitive punishment only (not saying that they shouldn't foot the bill). What we need is regulations and oversight. Which is why I feel, just like our HDBs, housing for them should be government run. That way, the government has control over it and we have indirect control over how the government treats them (e.g. making it a voter issue for pete's sake).",2020-04-14 00:46:43,reddit,nice opinion literally slap wrist companies construction expendable get injured workplace get shipped back home countries patching think fine bills wake call nah one expense got caught fine basically gamble calculations mistreat still green cos know events happen every year gladly pay mistreat know won follow try bend rules like people flout shn cb rules result worse conditions instance gets xyz communicable disease assuming hard test like instead reporting quickly ship back hometown grounds slacking work mitigated spread absolutely nothing happened bring next healthy batch need punitive punishment not saying shouldn foot bill need regulations oversight feel like hdbs housing should government run way government control indirect control government treats e g making voter issue pete sake,1.0

175,"SINGAPORE - Four vacant Housing Board blocks in Taman Jurong, known as the ""diamond blocks"", are being refurbished to house foreign workers working in essential services.In a notice to residents there on Friday (April 17), Senior Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam, who is MP for the Taman Jurong ward in Jurong GRC, said that works are ongoing to refurbish the vacant flats at Blocks 63 to 66 Yung Kuang Road to provide temporary housing for foreign workers, as part of Singapore's national fight against Covid-19.""Many of these foreign workers are doing important jobs that help to keep Singapore going: cleaners and maintenance workers in our neighbourhoods, those who keep our public transport running, and workers who keep electricity and water flowing to our homes,"" he wrote.He explained to residents that these workers need to be temporarily housed away from the existing worker dormitories, while the Government makes every effort to reduce and stop the spread of Covid-19 in their living quarters.""This will keep these workers safe, which will in turn help all of us stay safe,"" he wrote.The four 21-storey blocks, which are connected to form a diamond with a courtyard in the middle, are an iconic sight in Taman Jurong and have been dubbed the "" diamond blocks"" by heritage buffs.The 456-unit residential development was built by the JTC in the 1970s, with companies in the industrial zone renting the units to house their employees, including foreigners, and was later handed over to HDB.Covid-19: Don't miss the latest on the outbreak and its impactStay in the know with e-mail alertsEnter your e-mail Sign upBy signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions.With occupancy rates falling after the Asian financial crisis in 1997, HDB decided in 2001 to relocate remaining tenants to other rental blocks nearby, with businesses on the first two floors continuing operations.From 2009 to 2014, the blocks were used in a scheme which offered low-cost housing to people without permanent homes. In 2015, a year after the last interim housing residents were relocated, the units were spruced up for HDB's Parenthood Provisional Housing Scheme. The scheme puts families in temporary homes as they wait for their new Build-To-Order flats.Mr Tharman said precautions are being taken to ensure that the new temporary housing arrangement is safe for everyone. Just like all other Singapore residents, the workers will do their part by remaining in their flats, except when they travel to work using company transport or buy essentials in the shops at the four blocks.Related StoryCoronavirus: 21 vacant HDB blocks in Bukit Merah being refurbished to house essential foreign workersRelated StoryCoronavirus: Close to 700 foreign workers housed at Home Team Academy, Civil Defence AcademyRelated StoryCoronavirus: Cruise ships assessed for feasibility to temporarily house healthy foreign workersRelated StoryAbout 5,000 foreign workers to be tested for Covid-19 in next few days, even those who are well but are contacts of confirmed casesPolice and security officers will be deployed on site to ensure that rules are followed, and there will also be a temperature screening station for the workers when they leave for work and return each day.Movements in the compound have also been organised so that residents can continue to visit the shops in Blocks 63 to 66.Besides the Taman Jurong blocks, 21 vacant HDB blocks in Bukit Merah will also be refurbished to house healthy foreign workers working in essential services.These are blocks previously under the Selective En bloc Redevelopment Scheme, which buys back from residents public housing sitting on land with high redevelopment potential for other purposes. The flats were vacated in 2018 but not yet demolished.Sport facilities which are temporarily closed are also being used to house some workers. SportSG said workers will be progressively moved to ActiveSG sport halls at Pasir Ris, Jurong West, Clementi and Hougang  from Friday (April 17).Strict protocols will be in place to manage the workers entry and presence at these sport centres, a spokesman said.The Singapore Sports Hub has also converted the OCBC Arena Halls to temporarily house about 800 foreign workers from Friday, a spokesman said. The publics access to the halls, including the Arena Park, will be restricted.Foreign worker dormitories have been a growing source of concern during the Covid-19 outbreak, with 19 of the 43 large purpose-built dormitories now having clusters. There are also more than 10 clusters at smaller factory-converted dormitories.About 7,000 foreign workers in essential services living in purpose-built dormitories have moved into alternative living areas, such as military camps and floating hotels.Last week, Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry task force tackling the outbreak, said during a media conference that the number of workers in each dormitory needs to be reduced so that effective public health measures can be put in place.",2020-04-17 17:47:00,hardwarezone,singapore four vacant housing board blocks taman jurong known diamond blocks refurbished house working essential services notice residents friday april 17 senior minister tharman shanmugaratnam mp taman jurong ward jurong grc said works ongoing refurbish vacant flats blocks 63 66 yung kuang road provide temporary housing part singapore national fight against many important jobs help keep singapore going cleaners maintenance neighbourhoods keep public transport running keep electricity water flowing homes wrote explained residents need temporarily housed away existing government makes every effort reduce stop spread living quarters keep safe turn help us stay safe wrote four 21 storey blocks connected form diamond courtyard middle iconic sight taman jurong dubbed diamond blocks heritage buffs 456 unit residential development built jtc 1970s companies industrial zone renting units house employees including foreigners later handed hdb miss latest outbreak impactstay know e mail alertsenter e mail sign upby signing agree privacy policy terms conditions occupancy rates falling asian financial crisis 1997 hdb decided 2001 relocate remaining tenants rental blocks nearby businesses first two floors continuing operations 2009 2014 blocks used scheme offered low cost housing people without permanent homes 2015 year last interim housing residents relocated units spruced hdb parenthood provisional housing scheme scheme puts families temporary homes wait new build order flats mr tharman said precautions taken ensure new temporary housing arrangement safe everyone like singapore residents part remaining flats except travel work using company transport buy essentials shops four blocks related storycoronavirus 21 vacant hdb blocks bukit merah refurbished house essential workersrelated storycoronavirus close 700 housed home team academy civil defence academyrelated storycoronavirus cruise ships assessed feasibility temporarily house healthy workersrelated storyabout 5 000 tested next days even well contacts confirmed casespolice security officers deployed site ensure rules followed also temperature screening station leave work return day movements compound also organised residents continue visit shops blocks 63 66 besides taman jurong blocks 21 vacant hdb blocks bukit merah also refurbished house healthy working essential services blocks previously selective en bloc redevelopment scheme buys back residents public housing sitting land high redevelopment potential purposes flats vacated 2018 not yet demolished sport facilities temporarily closed also used house sportsg said progressively moved activesg sport halls pasir ris jurong west clementi hougang friday april 17 strict protocols place manage entry presence sport centres spokesman said singapore sports hub also converted ocbc arena halls temporarily house 800 friday spokesman said public access halls including arena park restricted growing source concern outbreak 43 large purpose built clusters also 10 clusters smaller factory converted 7 000 essential services living purpose built moved alternative living areas military camps floating hotels last week minister national development lawrence wong co chairs multi ministry task force tackling outbreak said media conference number needs reduced effective public health measures put place,1.0

234,"Hi. I've not been to any shophouse converted dormitories so I appreciate your insight. My opinion is based from experiences going into specifically built dormitory buildings and facilities and interacting with foreign workers residing in them such as westlite at toh guan. I estimate these dormitories are usually the size of a 4 or 3 room HDB flat with 1 room, a little smaller than the size of a tekong bunk as their sleeping areas consisting of multiple double decker beds. Usually they also have two more rooms, one for a living room and another for a kitchen but the sizes vary across the different dormitories. They also have a toilet in each bunk. Some bunks have TVs inside which they use to normally watch cricket.

In each bunk there's also a designated cook. As for things to eat, they usually buy their own raw ingredients to cook with. One of the reasons I like going to dormitories is apart from the friendly people is that the food they cook smells good. The smell of rice is always present especially in the evenings. 

I understand that my experiences should not be generalised to all but I believe what you mentioned is the minority and such treatment of foreign workers should be eradicated.",2020-04-08 14:00:10,reddit,hi not shophouse converted appreciate insight opinion based experiences going specifically built buildings facilities interacting residing westlite toh guan estimate usually size 4 3 room hdb flat 1 room little smaller size tekong bunk sleeping areas consisting multiple double decker beds usually also two rooms one living room another kitchen sizes vary across different also toilet bunk bunks tvs inside use normally watch cricket bunk also designated cook things eat usually buy raw ingredients cook one reasons like going apart friendly people food cook smells good smell rice always present especially evenings understand experiences should not generalised believe mentioned minority treatment should eradicated,1.0

238,"As someone who's been following the situation for a while now I'd say that you have to take things into context.

Many people say that the government should have made mask wearing mandatory earlier. Thing is, Singapore didn't have any factories of its own until February, and the countries it sourced masks from banned exports. (EDIT: Plus, while Singapore does have its own stockpile for healthcare workers, if the government were to provide everyone with surgical masks, they'd probably run out in a matter of weeks, if not days.) So at the time, it made perfect sense not to wear masks.

And also, regarding the situation in dorms: that was in large part due to a superspreading event at Mustafa Centre. 2 imported cases there eventually infected 80+ cases, many of which were migrant workers, who would later bring it into their dorms. And since the workers live communally, once 1 case was detected (a couple days after infection mind you) it'd've been almost impossible to stop. The government for their part did a total lockdown of dorms about a week after their first case. 

While there is room for improvement, the actions they took were understandable.

EDIT: Adding on, I don't quite agree with the narrative that the government ignored migrant workers - they stopped mass assemblies and staggered usage of communal facilities as early as [mid-February.](-releases/2020/0210-mom-issues-updated-advisory-on-enhanced-precautionary-measure-for-dormitory)",2020-05-30 17:30:14,reddit,someone following situation say take things context many people say government should made mask wearing mandatory earlier thing singapore didn factories february countries sourced masks banned exports edit plus singapore stockpile healthcare government provide everyone surgical masks probably run matter weeks not days time made perfect sense not wear masks also regarding situation large part due superspreading event mustafa centre 2 imported eventually infected 80 many would later bring since live communally 1 case detected couple days infection mind almost impossible stop government part total lockdown week first case room improvement actions took understandable edit adding quite agree narrative government ignored stopped mass assemblies staggered usage communal facilities early mid february releases 2020 0210 mom issues updated advisory enhanced precautionary measure,1.0

The general wisdom is that 
testing is important because asking people with mild symptoms just to stay home will lead to more infections in the household and community. If tested and positive, people can either be isolated in a facility (like in China/Vietnam) or put on strict home isolation (which they are more likely to adhere to if they know they have the virus for sure).

Think about it. It is a question of levels of responsibility. At the event level, there is nothing LTA or TP could have done really. Someone wants to drive fast, who can stop the person? 

But at the system level, LTA and TP can put in place a governance structure and traffic systems (like speed camera, traffic lights, speed bumps, etc etc) to prevent speeding. And they have done this very well. Exceptionally well. Hence , speeding on roads in Singapore isn't a huge problem.

Same with MOM. At the event level, if a dorm operator decides not to comply to regulations and allow too many workers to sleep in a small space, creating a fire and health hazard that night, what can MOM do? MOM cannot be everywhere. 

BUT - if MOM had put in place a regulatory and incentive framework that works, with a proper system of audits, a system that strongly disincentives dorm operators from flouting the regulations, then we will not be in the shit we are today.

The moment I clicked post, it disappeared and I don't see it on his wall except for only his messages.*Hong Kong, with much domestic unrest and violence, managed to do a better job than your government in dealing with the COVID19 pandemic crisis. Meaning they were in the midst of a crisis management, when this COVID19 pandemic crisis happened, and they managed it so well too. In fact quite a number of countries, Taiwan, New Zealand, South Korea, etc, with higher population than us with Ministers earning much less than you and your Ministers, have carried out a better crisis management, with foresight. You and your Ministers are earning an exorbitant amount of salary and failing miserably during this COVID19 pandemic crisis. Your worth should be evident, not during the good times but times like this adverse condition. It's fine if you and your government had erred but at least be accountable and apologetic, instead of going on your defence to give excuses. This is not the first time. Each and every time you have messed it up, it's always going on the defence with excuses. Never apologetic with reasons. It's fine to be wrong. No one is perfect. For at least once be bold enough to be accountable, apologetic and be outright about your next course of action. It's so easy for you and your government to point fingers at the opposition but get offended when fingers are pointed at you and be revengeful. To mention that I'm disappointed and frustrated is understating. Do the right thing by going live on television again to admit that you and your government had erred and apologise.

467,"> # COVID-19: Singapore confirms 219 new patients, with six community cases

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) preliminarily reported 219 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Friday (26 June) noon, bringing the total to 42,955.

> Of them, six are classified as community cases, while the remaining are foreign workers living in dormitories.

> “Based on our investigations so far, there are six cases in the community, of whom five are Singaporeans/permanent residents and one is a work-pass holder,” said the MOH.

> The ministry added that more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> This story will be updated later.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of 2,774 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge with 2,055 cases, Jurong Penjuru Dormitory with 1,809 cases, Cassia @ Penjuru with 1,474 cases and Tuas View Dormitory with 1,409 cases.

> These dorms, the top five clusters with the highest number of cases here, account for over 20 per cent of the total infected workers living in dorms. Some 400,000 such workers live in such residences here.

> The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Tuesday that 31 more dorms have been cleared of COVID-19: 27 factory-converted dormitories and four construction temporary quarters.

> Four blocks for recovered workers in three purpose-built dorms have also been cleared, the MOM added.

> This takes the total number to 163 dorms and 18 blocks for recovered workers in 11 purpose-built dorms cleared of COVID-19.

> As of Monday, about 79,000 foreign workers have been cleared of COVID-19, including those residing in government-provided accommodation facilities, said the MOM. Last week, a forecast of dormitories and blocks to be cleared from now till August onwards was published on the ministry’s website.

> With 305 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Wednesday, 36,604  cases – some 86 per cent of the total tally – have fully recovered from the infection.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while at least one is in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Thousands of patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 26 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, 11 others who tested positive for the virus were determined to have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and another four, including the 48-year-old male Indian national, whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> As of 15 June, the ministry has conducted 576,189 swab tests, of which 340,894 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 101,100 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 59,800 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

> Singapore entered Phase 2 of its reopening – with various safe distancing measures still in place – on 19 June. This phase is expected to last up to six months or longer, according to authorities.

> Singapore’s General Election will take place on 10 July during this phase.

476,"Record 287 new Covid-19 cases in S'pore, links found between Mustafa Centre and clusters in foreign worker dormitoriesWorkers at the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol on April 6, 2020. Most of the new cases are linked to foreign worker dormitories.ST PHOTO: KEVIN LIMSINGAPORE - Singapore saw a sharp spike of 287 coronavirus cases on Thursday (April 9), with the majority linked to foreign worker dormitories.This is the highest daily number reported to date and brings the total number of cases here to 1,910, as the global number of cases crossed the 1.5 million mark.Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean is now advising the multi-ministry taskforce on handling the Covid-19 situation in foreign worker dormitories, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, noting that the police and Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) are involved in operations there.To cut the chain of transmission in dormitories, thousands of foreign workers who are healthy - especially those working in essential services - will be moved to army camps, floating hotels, and vacant Housing Board blocks.Singapore has also started active case finding and is swab-testing workers in various dormitories, said the Health Ministry's (MOH) director of medical services Kenneth Mak at a press conference on Thursday.Preliminary investigations have linked the cluster at Mustafa Centre with clusters at the construction site at Project Glory and five dormitories.Associate Professor Mak said the ministry believes that foreign workers had visited Mustafa Centre, where some employees had fallen ill, and gotten infected there.They then transmitted the infection to their co-workers, who subsequently infected others at their dormitories.""Many had very mild symptoms and so they continued to work, that's why there was a delay in picking them up,"" said Mr Wong, who chairs the ministerial task force along with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong. It is likely that the virus had been spreading in dormitories for some time, he said.Preliminary investigations have linked the cluster at Mustafa Centre with clusters at the construction site at Project Glory and five dormitories. ST PHOTOS: TIMOTHY DAVID, ONG WEE JINMr Wong said Singapore is dealing with two separate infection spreads.In foreign worker dormitories, numbers are rising sharply, he noted. But in the wider community, numbers are more stable.""This is a major and urgent issue that requires active intervention,"" he said. ""That is why we decided to put in more resources and set up a dedicated task force focusing on dorms.""On Tuesday, the Manpower Ministry (MOM) had announced the formation of an inter-agency task force to provide support to foreign workers and dormitory operators.The task force will ensure the well-being of workers and improve their living conditions by supporting dormitory operators as they implement ""circuit-breaker"" measures.MOM is supported by the Ministry of Health, National Environment Agency, the SAF, the Singapore Police Force, Migrant Workers' Centre and other agencies.Explaining the Government's decision to set up a task force, Mr Wong said: ""We cannot rely solely on dorm operators any more, given the current situation.""Manpower Minister Josephine Teo noted that there has been no cluster in dormitories until recently, even though a number of foreign workers have tested positive for the virus.""Bear in mind that dorms are home to foreign workers,"" she added. ""Within dorms workers interact with each other very regularly, very closely, they're like family, so the risk of transmission was always there.""Workers will now not be able to prepare their own meals, to reduce human contact, and cleanliness and hygiene have been stepped up. Existing sick bays will also be scaled up to take care of workers that need to be isolated.Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that despite*circuit breaker measures kicking in on Tuesday, social gatherings are still taking place. More than 10,000 written advisories have been issued over the past two days to those who did not observe safe distancing.""This cannot continue,"" he said.Mr Wong added that enforcement efforts will be stepped up against those who continue to flout safe-distancing measures.""We hope Singaporeans will comply not just because of enforcement efforts but really out of a necessity for all of us to do our part,"" he said.-A5uAciPw",2020-09-04 20:41:00,hardwarezone,record 287 new pore links found mustafa centre clusters dormitoriesworkers s11 punggol april 6 2020 new linked st photo kevin limsingapore singapore saw sharp spike 287 thursday april 9 majority linked highest daily number reported date brings total number 1 910 global number crossed 1 5 million mark coordinating minister national security teo chee hean advising multi ministry taskforce handling situation said national development minister lawrence wong noting police singapore armed forces saf involved operations cut chain transmission thousands healthy especially working essential services moved army camps floating hotels vacant housing board blocks singapore also started active case finding swab testing various said health ministry moh director medical services kenneth mak press conference thursday preliminary investigations linked cluster mustafa centre clusters construction site project glory five associate professor mak said ministry believes visited mustafa centre employees fallen ill gotten infected transmitted infection co subsequently infected others many mild symptoms continued work delay picking said mr wong chairs ministerial task force along health minister gan kim yong likely spreading time said preliminary investigations linked cluster mustafa centre clusters construction site project glory five st photos timothy david ong wee jinmr wong said singapore dealing two separate infection spreads numbers rising sharply noted wider community numbers stable major urgent issue requires active intervention said decided put resources set dedicated task force focusing tuesday manpower ministry mom announced formation inter agency task force provide support operators task force ensure well improve living conditions supporting operators implement circuit breaker measures mom supported ministry health national environment agency saf singapore police force centre agencies explaining government decision set task force mr wong said cannot rely solely operators given current situation manpower minister josephine teo noted no cluster recently even though number tested positive bear mind home added within interact regularly closely like family risk transmission always not able prepare meals reduce human contact cleanliness hygiene stepped existing sick bays also scaled take care need isolated health minister gan kim yong said despite circuit breaker measures kicking tuesday social gatherings still taking place 10 000 written advisories issued past two days not observe safe distancing cannot continue said mr wong added enforcement efforts stepped against continue flout safe distancing measures hope singaporeans comply not enforcement efforts really necessity us part said a5uacipw,1.0

The two ships together can accommodate up to 2,000 foreign workers.""Every effort will be made to uphold the health and welfare of Singapores foreign workers while on board the ship, which include observing the highest standards of safe distancing and preventive measures at all timess,"" said Genting Cruise Lines.We are pleased that our on board facilities, as well as preventive and safety standards meet Singapores strict requirements for this initiative,"" said Mr Michael Goh, president of Dream Cruises, adding that there have been no reported cases of COVID-19 among its guests or crew to date.The SuperStar Gemini arrived on Apr 17 from Hong Kong, and is berthed at Marina Bay Cruise Centre Singapore.

597,"I am not exactly sure if the push has stagnated, or that it's more of just moving past the initial announcement stages. 

Of course, I agree we should always strive to push ourselves. And I guess whether or not we should push harder is difficult to say. But I think we must always consider that it takes two hands to clap, and the govt does not own all building projects in singapore. 


For example, let's take sthg like Building Info. Modelling or known as BIM(this is essentially just a software that helps digitise most information about a construction project into a shared platform). BCA has pushed out FREE training and have made it mandatory for many civil servants to attend BIM courses. But at the end of the day, BIM is akin to 3d modelling softwares or Photoshop and is not something that one can pick up part time after work. They did consider making it neccessary for contractors to submit BIM plans before, but if 90% of the contractors are unable to comply then honestly what can the govt realistically do? Literally free training has already been provided and it's not realistic to push employees to Push aside their existing workload in an already labor tight sector to learn about BIM. Plus, most of them are really much older (I'm not kidding, there seems to be so few local engineers below 30 who actually go into construction). Push too hard, take a ""I don't care you must comply"" approach and they may not even bother to apply for govt projects anymore or will be unable to adapt and close shop. 

TL;DR, I think even if we call for govt to push harder, again it's very important to realise that the govt is not omnipotent and it requires cooperation of the private sector. It's already a tight market with very little local interest, and honestly the govt is not in a good position to be too harsh when the pool of companies to select from isn't that high in the first place and pumping money, restrictions and training has (arguably) not been enough to some people's perspective. And I'm not again calls for change, but just that I feel very bad for civil servants when everyone seems to pin everything to the G when honestly it's SGprns ourselves who enter the workforce (or choose not to) and perpetuate certain inhibiting factors which is again, not their fault when most contractors/ consultants are already underpaid and overwork and are most of the time not even locals who have vested interest in the wider SG situation. Like we've literally created engineering scholarships and internship packages with VERY skewed benefits to engineers and architects that has seemed to fortunately attract some young bloods from my batch into these sectors but it's gonna take time to seem the effect.

People seem to think that companies can set whatever price they want for their projects. They can't - there's a market price due to competition.

The other objection I see often is that companies can just spend a little more on better dormitories and make a less profit as the ""moral"" thing to do. Again it's not that simple. Cash will flow to projects and companies with better profit margins. Post smaller margins than your competitors? Banks will be less likely to finance your projects and investors will be less likely to invest in your company. Less projects and less profits also means talent will slowly start ebbing out of the company. It's a slow spiral to the death of a company.

We need to be careful with this as well, otherwise the costs for the better dorms will be passed to the workers.

If the govt initially told people there's no need to wear masks due to fear of panic-buying of masks, then it does make sense why they would say that. Not that it excuses them from preparing a readily-available supply of masks for an epidemic, but I could see why they did it regardless.

The dorm situation coming about due to a super-spreading is understandable as well. Nevertheless, when criticising the govt, many commenters here are pointing out the lack of preparation on the FW dorms to prevent spread of infectious diseases as a whole. They did a lockdown in the end, so at least they did something even if it was a little too late. Seems to be a case of lack of foresight rather than malevolence.

The impression I am getting is that the main issue lies with the preparation for this epidemic, though it's harder to criticise them on this alone. I'm sure this situation is not benefitting the govt at all (with GE coming up) so they probably did what they thought was the best thing to do, even if the consequences were damaging to smaller businesses, for example.

671,"Some foreign workers who have recovered from COVID-19 in Singapore will be temporarily housed on two SuperStar cruise ships, Genting Cruise Lines said on Friday (May 1).SuperStar Gemini and SuperStar Aquarius have ""completed stringent evaluation checks"" by the Government and will provide accommodation for the workers, it said in a press release.The number of COVID-19 cases among migrant workers living in dormitories has surged in recent weeks, and now make up about 85 per cent of Singapore's 16,169 cases.Many workers who are well have been moved out of the tightly packed dormitories to other living quarters, such as military camps and vacant HDB flats.On Apr 27, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong said that authorities have an ""extensive"" plan to house recovered foreign migrant workers, involving new sites.Earlier, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) had said that the two cruise ships were being assessed as they have readily available rooms and en-suite toilets to minimise person-to-person contact.The assessment considered factors such as the ships ventilation systems, security protocols and infection control measures, said STB.

681,"The government had a major blind spot. -and-politics/2020...rkers.htmlJust last month, some East and Southeast Asian countries were held up as models for their coronavirus responses—especially Singapore and Taiwan, which had largely contained the outbreak despite close economic, geographic, and cultural ties to China, the pandemic’s original epicenter. Some have continued to fare well. Taiwan, with only 428 confirmed cases, has managed to avoid a lockdown. Even South Korea, despite an alarming rate of infection in early March, has flattened its curve. But Singapore now has the largest recorded outbreak in Southeast Asia. Between its first case on Jan. 23 and March 23, Singapore reported fewer than 510 known cases of COVID-19. Now, it has more than 11,000Despite Singapore’s early vigilance in addressing the pandemic—including extensive contact tracing—the government’s response had a blind spot. The key to what happened lies in how Singapore, a country of 5.8 million people, has treated its migrant workers.Singapore relies on foreign labor to build and maintain its gleaming infrastructure. But about 300,000 of the country’s low-wage migrant workers, mostly from South Asia, live in dense dormitories on the outskirts of the island nation.* Rights groups and activists worried early on about the government’s negligence of the migrant population. In March, Transient Workers Count Too, or TWC2, a Singaporean nonprofit dedicated to improving conditions for migrant workers, warned of a potential cluster outbreak in the dorms, where it’s impossible to socially distance. Migrants often sleep 12 to 20 per room, in bunk beds, and they’re packed into the back of trucks on their commute to work each day. Some told the Guardian the shared bathrooms often don’t have soap or enough water for showers or toilets. The group also noted that employer policies often discourage workers from admitting they’re ill or seeking medical help. “The risk of a new cluster among this group remains undeniable,” TWC2 wrote.Over the past few weeks, as COVID-19 has traveled through the dorms, Singapore has quickly lost control of its outbreak. (While the country was initially worried about a second wave from Singaporeans returning home from overseas, those cases have been largely controlled.) The Ministry of Health said that 982 of the 1,037 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday were migrant workers. About 80 percent of all cases in the country can now be traced to the dorms.“This reflects the deliberate invisibilization of the foreign worker; the whole machinery of state operates as though they don’t exist,” Alex Au, vice president of TWC2, told the Washington Post.Singapore has responded to the outbreak by introducing a partial lockdown in the country, which has shuttered most workplaces and staggered the days individuals can go to supermarkets, until at least June 1. The government has moved 7,000 workers, mostly in essential jobs, out of the dorms, the Guardian reported, but about 293,000 remain. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong wrote in a Facebook post last week that the government is building up its health care and isolation infrastructure to reduce the “chain of transmission” in migrant housing. On Tuesday, the government announced a quarantine for the dorms and said that it is setting up medical facilities and triage clinics there to ensure workers get adequate care. “It will take some time to show results, so we must expect to see more dorm cases for a while longer,” Lee wrote in the Facebook post.Singapore’s outbreak serves as a cautionary tale for neglecting marginalized communities during a pandemic. It’s hard not to see parallels between Singapore’s migrant workers and the U.S.’s underclass of essential workers who labor without the necessary safety protections, or our undocumented farmworkers who are somehow considered both “essential” and “illegal” (and are even being detained on the job). Singapore’s preparedness for COVID-19 is something other countries have only aspired to: It’s implemented aggressive contact tracing and widespread testing and is home to a robust health care system and an efficient government that can enforce strict home quarantines. And yet it has shown us that, without looking after society’s more vulnerable members, those measures won’t be enough.",2020-05-24 20:41:00,sgtalk,government major blind spot politics 2020 rkers htmljust last month east southeast asian countries held models responses especially singapore taiwan largely contained outbreak despite close economic geographic cultural ties china pandemic original epicenter continued fare well taiwan 428 confirmed managed avoid lockdown even south korea despite alarming rate infection early march flattened curve singapore largest recorded outbreak southeast asia first case jan 23 march 23 singapore reported fewer 510 known 11 000despite singapore early vigilance addressing pandemic including extensive contact tracing government response blind spot key happened lies singapore country 5 8 million people treated singapore relies labor build maintain gleaming infrastructure 300 000 country low wage mostly south asia live dense outskirts island nation rights groups activists worried early government negligence population march transient count twc2 singaporean nonprofit dedicated improving conditions warned potential cluster outbreak impossible socially distance migrants often sleep 12 20 per room bunk beds packed back trucks commute work day told guardian shared bathrooms often soap enough water showers toilets group also noted employer policies often discourage admitting ill seeking medical help risk new cluster among group remains undeniable twc2 wrote past weeks traveled singapore quickly lost control outbreak country initially worried second wave singaporeans returning home overseas largely controlled ministry health said 982 1 037 new thursday 80 percent country traced reflects deliberate invisibilization whole machinery state operates though exist alex au vice president twc2 told washington post singapore responded outbreak introducing partial lockdown country shuttered workplaces staggered days individuals go supermarkets least june 1 government moved 7 000 mostly essential jobs guardian reported 293 000 remain prime minister lee hsien loong wrote facebook post last week government building health care isolation infrastructure reduce chain transmission housing tuesday government announced quarantine said setting medical facilities triage clinics ensure get adequate care take time show results must expect see longer lee wrote facebook post singapore outbreak serves cautionary tale neglecting marginalized communities pandemic hard not see parallels singapore u underclass essential labor without necessary safety protections undocumented farmworkers somehow considered essential illegal even detained job singapore preparedness something countries aspired implemented aggressive contact tracing widespread testing home robust health care system efficient government enforce strict home quarantines yet shown us without looking society vulnerable members measures won enough,1.0

690,"The increased spotlight on the plight of foreign workers and their vulnerability in the Covid-19 crisis has led to an outpouring of donations from Singaporeans despite economic hard times caused by the coronavirus.Several fundraising campaigns have smashed their targets within 24 hours, raising a total of S$345,000 in just a few days.Mr Ethan Guo, the general manager of Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), set up a fundraiser on the night of April 5 when it was reported that the Covid-19 situation was beginning to affect a large number of foreign workers in dormitories. He started receiving messages from people asking what they could do to help.The fundraiser, which was initially set at a target of S$20,000, is aimed at gathering donations to top-up foreign workers' prepaid SIM cards.I was not expecting we would even hit S$20,000. I was very surprised when I saw that we were already a quarter way there by lunchtime. By the next morning, we had already surpassed the target, said Mr Guo, whose organisation promotes equitable treatment for foreign workers in Singapore.His target has been raised to S$120,000 and over S$116,000 had been collected as of 5pm on Thursday (April 9).Mr Guo decided to raise funds to top-up SIM cards after receiving feedback from workers who said that they are in need of these cards to let them keep in touch with family back home.Most of the foreign workers are now stuck in dormitories with limited or no WiFi access. They also have no means or money to top up their cards to make basic phone calls or to buy data during such a critical time, he said.Mr Guo added that his team is already in the midst of consolidating names and numbers of workers they have reached out to via Facebook and word-of-mouth. The top-up will then be done for them online, he said.The number of Covid-19 cases in foreign worker dormitories has escalated quickly in the last few days with more than 20,000 workers currently quarantined in three dormitories after clusters of the infections were found.S11 @ Punggol, Westlite Toh Guan and Toh Guan Dormitory have been gazetted as isolation areas and workers are to stay in their rooms for 14 days. Covid-19 cases have also been found at Singapore's largest foreign worker dormitory Sungei Tengah Lodge, which has also been gazetted as an isolation area, as well as Tampines Dormitory and Kranji Lodge.Concerns about the virus spreading at the tight living quarters of dormitories have been raised after reports of unsanitary and crowded living conditions surfaced, prompting a petition titled Protect our migrant workers from Covid-19 to be put up on Tuesday on petition website Change.org.Some of the concerns highlighted in the petition included overcrowded spaces with 12 men per room and 60 men sharing toilets. Workers also reported that meals were not being delivered on time and that there were inadequate supplies of masks, sanitisers and other essential supplies.The petition, directed to Manpower Minister Josephine Teo had garnered over 9,000 signatures out of its goal of 10,000 as of 5pm on Thursday.In a statement released on Wednesday, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said that every meal distribution exercise is now completed within two hours and portions have been increased after taking into account feedback from the workers.To cope with the increased usage of washroom facilities and higher volumes of rubbish generated due to workers now spending the entire day in the dormitories, MOM said that the frequency of refuse collection and removal have been increased from once to three or four times daily. The disinfection and cleaning of the common areas and washroom facilities are also being carried out three times per day.Beyond this Covid-19 situation, Mr Guo said the funds collected will assist foreign workers who have salary or work injury issues and those who have lost their jobs and have no income. The funds will also be used to top-up their EZ-Link cards as a single trip to the hospital or the MOM from places such as Tuas costs at least S$3 one way, he said.In support of Mr Guos campaign, social media personality Preeti Nair, 25, took to her Facebook, Instagram and YouTube pages on Wednesday morning. She urged her over 50,000 followers to donate to a fundraiser she set up on Give.asia, a fundraising campaign website, to support non-governmental organisations such as Mr Guos TWC2.In a little over 12 hours, her goal of S$100,000 was reached, and as of 5pm on Thursday had hit S$155,000.What I am doing is just using my platform to bridge communities. We did not expect this at all.I personally thought it was a really ambitious goal so I am honestly speechless and grateful for the generosity and amount of kindness shown towards these foreign workers, said Ms Nair, who set up the fundraiser in collaboration with Utopia, a group of friends hoping to raise awareness of less visible and vulnerable communities here such as foreign workers.The donations received will go to Mr Guos TWC2 top-up campaign as well as to HealthServe, another organisation which has purchased health-care bags containing personal hygiene items such as hand sanitiser, antibacterial soap and masks for these workers.Ms Nair added that she intends on keeping the page open for as long as its helpful.Ms Julia Tan, 24, who works with crowdfunding platform FundedHere, launched the 10in10: Raising 10K (S$10,000) in 10 days for Migrant Workers fundraising campaign on Give.asia on Monday, alongside the Social Development Initiative Academy, a social enterprise that champions the welfare of foreign workers in Singapore.Instead of the 10-day target she had set, she raised the sum in under 24 hours, and as of 5pm on Thursday had raised S$15,000.We were incredibly surprised at the amount of community spirit displayed. This shows that despite the racist comments you sometimes see online that perceive foreign workers to be a disposable workforce, there are still Singaporeans who are able to see that foreign workers are human too and deserve human rights, she said.The donations gathered from her fundraiser will go towards providing essential hygiene kits that include face masks and hand sanitisers and dry essential food items like rice and oil.-cases-spike",2020-09-04 18:52:00,hardwarezone,increased spotlight plight vulnerability crisis led outpouring donations singaporeans despite economic hard times caused several fundraising campaigns smashed targets within 24 hours raising total 345 000 days mr ethan guo general manager transient count twc2 set fundraiser night april 5 reported situation beginning affect large number started receiving messages people asking could help fundraiser initially set target 20 000 aimed gathering donations top prepaid sim cards not expecting would even hit 20 000 surprised saw already quarter way lunchtime next morning already surpassed target said mr guo whose organisation promotes equitable treatment singapore target raised 120 000 116 000 collected 5pm thursday april 9 mr guo decided raise funds top sim cards receiving feedback said need cards let keep touch family back home stuck limited no wifi access also no means money top cards make basic phone calls buy data critical time said mr guo added team already midst consolidating names numbers reached via facebook word mouth top done online said number escalated quickly last days 20 000 currently quarantined three clusters infections found s11 punggol westlite toh guan toh guan gazetted isolation areas stay rooms 14 days also found singapore largest sungei tengah lodge also gazetted isolation area well tampines kranji lodge concerns spreading tight living quarters raised reports unsanitary crowded living conditions surfaced prompting petition titled protect put tuesday petition website change org concerns highlighted petition included overcrowded spaces 12 men per room 60 men sharing toilets also reported meals not delivered time inadequate supplies masks sanitisers essential supplies petition directed manpower minister josephine teo garnered 9 000 signatures goal 10 000 5pm thursday statement released wednesday ministry manpower mom said every meal distribution exercise completed within two hours portions increased taking account feedback cope increased usage washroom facilities higher volumes rubbish generated due spending entire day mom said frequency refuse collection removal increased three four times daily disinfection cleaning common areas washroom facilities also carried three times per day beyond situation mr guo said funds collected assist salary work injury issues lost jobs no income funds also used top ez link cards single trip hospital mom places tuas costs least 3 one way said support mr guo campaign social media personality preeti nair 25 took facebook instagram youtube pages wednesday morning urged 50 000 followers donate fundraiser set give asia fundraising campaign website support non governmental organisations mr guo twc2 little 12 hours goal 100 000 reached 5pm thursday hit 155 000 using platform bridge communities not expect personally thought really ambitious goal honestly speechless grateful generosity amount kindness shown towards said ms nair set fundraiser collaboration utopia group friends hoping raise awareness less visible vulnerable communities donations received go mr guo twc2 top campaign well healthserve another organisation purchased health care bags containing personal hygiene items hand sanitiser antibacterial soap masks ms nair added intends keeping page open long helpful ms julia tan 24 works crowdfunding platform fundedhere launched 10in10 raising 10k 10 000 10 days fundraising campaign give asia monday alongside social development initiative academy social enterprise champions welfare singapore instead 10 day target set raised sum 24 hours 5pm thursday raised 15 000 incredibly surprised amount community spirit displayed shows despite racist comments sometimes see online perceive disposable workforce still singaporeans able see human deserve human rights said donations gathered fundraiser go towards providing essential hygiene kits include face masks hand sanitisers dry essential food items like rice oil spike,1.0

Some will say that these are work permit holders (likely supervisors) that earn slightly more, and thus don't need to live in dorms.

802,"One possible way is to reduce the reliance on foreign workers. Of course the counter argument is that it is easier said than done. I agree that certain field like the construction field require more manual labour etc and yes we definitely need foreign workers to contribute to our economy. However, do we need such a huge amount of them ? Or are they here because corporations want them here to maximise their profits ?  When we were in the early 2000s they were here mainly for construction and S&CC services. However, more and more came to roles such as building maintenance and marine services. I believe some Singaporeans would be willing to take on such roles if not for the otherwise poor salary given as corporations wants to keep their expenses low to maximise profits and the easier option is to choose the foreign worker option.

In the view of improving living conditions, it might be necessary to build more dormitories but they could still be built at areas where the population doesn’t resides. If we have to settle them at offshore facilities or floating dormitories then so be it. Also, cleanliness of shared areas could be enforced. I wouldn’t dare to make the assumption that their living spaces is same as what the SAF provides but I would dare to say that it is at least comparable. Why are shared areas and living spaces in bunks way better than what the FWs are living in ? I think it boils down to discipline. Some SAF bunks have 8 double decker beds in a single room and yet the area is still clean af. The question is, are they committed to clean up after their own?

Toronto's numbers are stable now, but Canadas numbers exploded to over 1.2k a day for the last 2 weeks pretty much - it seems like a lot. 

You have to dive deeper: see critical cases and ICUs. Singapore drove away SARS through proper hygiene and communication of that to everyone. This is arguably scarier since Singapore locked down relatively late, knowing that corona can double quite effectively if you did not have lockdowns/distancing in proper effect (no clubbing, no movies, no schools etc.). Singapore is well suited to deal with the hospital flow, some of the best healthcare in the world.

919,"The spoilt ones are us, Singaporeans. Not them. Easy for us to talk when we are not tested in this life, like them.

Several months ago I was in a public place of worship. We were leaving when we saw big pools of blood trails on the floor (someone had a bad cut and ran to the toilet).

People were oblivious and walking bare feet into the blood splatters and spreading them further almost reaching the sterile carpet area.

We Singaporeans have alot of ideas, and initiatives. We started to warn people and started to look for the cleaner on duty (not to be found).

Almost 15 minutes passed. One Bangladesh carpark technician (a guest there) suddenly walked over with a mop and bucket and started mopping the mess. Problem solved. We all looked on, like ... ""why didn't I think of that.""

The problem with us is, we are selective. Dirty or difficult job, we tend to 'geng' and 'siam' (outsmart and avoid). We even freeze and become lost when it comes to such calamities.

So instead of looking for the mop, we are conditioned to look for the one who is suppose to mop, and adopt a not-my-job attitude.

People were complaining about the government encouraging Singaporeans not to wear masks as it was scientifically wrong information. They claimed that healthy people had no need to wear masks, when this was clearly untrue as wearing masks does indeed protect healthy people from the virus, as evidenced by lots of scientific research.

Obviously we do indeed have a lack of surgical masks. But the government should have encouraged the usage of reusable cloth masks. That way we would be able to ensure that Singaporeans were protected from the virus while also simultaneously ensuring that there were enough masks for our healthcare workers.

948,"Ex-Deputy Prime Ministers Tharman and Teo Chee Hean brought in to handle manpower matters -deputy-prime...r-matters/After Senior Ministers Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Teo Chee Hean were roped in to handle manpower matters like the jobs council and the foreign worker dormitories situation, some Singaporeans are speculating whether Manpower Minister Josephine Teo was given too big a portfolio for her to cope with.Mr Tharman and Mr Teo served as Singapore’s Deputy Prime Ministers from 2011 to 2019. The pair stepped down from their posts and became Senior Ministers on 1 May 2019, following a Cabinet reshuffle that was designed to give fourth-generation (4G) ministers more exposure and responsibilities so that they can better support the next Prime Minister who will come from their cohort.The Cabinet reshuffle saw the ruling People’s Action Party’s (PAP) 4G cohort accept several promotions that resulted in them leading two-thirds of the Government’s ministries. Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat kept his ministry but also succeeded Mr Tharman and Mr Teo as Singapore’s sole Deputy Prime Minister, giving rise to speculation that he is the ruling party’s Prime Minister designate.Besides Mr Tharman and Mr Teo, fellow veteran politician Lim Swee Say stepped down from his post as Manpower Minister and was succeeded by Josephine Teo, who became Singapore’s second female minister to helm a ministry after Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu.While Mr Tharman and Mr Teo seemed to take a backseat to allow the younger ministers to take charge, they have now taken on important responsibilities that pertain to manpower.Current DPM Heng Swee Keat tapped on Mr Tharman to chair the new National Jobs Council. Asserting that his predecessor has “both detailed knowledge and deep expertise in this issue” in his latest supplementary budget speech last month, Mr Heng revealed that the National Jobs Council will focus on creating jobs and helping workers build deep skills to stay employable in the challenging economy.Mr Teo was brought in to handle the foreign worker dormitories issue after COVID-19 outbreaks in the dorms ended up infecting over 33,567 workers and counting. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that Mr Teo is playing an advisory role in the Government’s inter agency task force to handle the situation in the dorms.The veteran politicians’ involvement in what are perceived as manpower matters has raised questions about the capabilities of Manpower Minister Josephine Teo.Mrs Teo was just recently under public scrutiny for the way she handled the COVID-19 outbreaks at the foreign worker dormitories. Some Singaporeans blamed the minister for allowing the COVID-19 situation to spiral out of control among migrant workers even though she was warned in advance that this might happen due to the workers’ overcrowded living conditions.When she was asked why she did not act early in implementing safe distancing measures in the dorms before the coronavirus infection spread uncontrolled, Mrs Teo did not apologise and instead blamed a lack of hindsight.Expressing a wish to “rewind the clock” to implement safe distancing measures in the dorms earlier, she told the local press: “If possible, I really wish to know at which stage the infection has already spread to community and migrant workers group? If time can be rewound, this is what I wish I could know.”The source from who? Our MSM or foreign writer with agendas......

I believe that this is the only realistic path seeing that reducing the number of people will reduce the strain on the common facilities (toilets, shower area etc etc), and reduce the amount of dirt being brought in from their work sites. There are also arguments that the reason that dorms are in their bad states is also partially due to their own habits and culture where what they consider as ""clean"" might not be ""clean"" to Singaporean standards. 

To combat this, relocating them to less dense dorms seems to be most logical sense in improving their living conditions.

It is likely that the virus had been spreading in dormitories for some time, he said.Mr Wong said Singapore is dealing with two separate infection spreads.In foreign worker dormitories, numbers are rising sharply, he noted. But in the wider community, numbers are more stable.""This is a major and urgent issue that requires active intervention,"" he said. ""That is why we decided to put in more resources and set up a dedicated task force focusing on dorms.""On Tuesday, the Manpower Ministry (MOM) had announced the formation of an inter-agency task force to provide support to foreign workers and dormitory operators.The task force will ensure the well-being of workers and improve their living conditions by supporting dormitory operators as they implement circuit breaker measures.MOM is supported by the Ministry of Health, National Environment Agency, the SAF, the Singapore Police Force, Migrant Workers' Centre and other agencies.Explaining the Government's decision to set up a task force, Mr Wong said: ""We cannot rely solely on dorm operators anymore, given the current situation.""Manpower Minister Josephine Teo noted that there has been no cluster in dormitories until recently, even though a number of foreign workers have tested positive for the virus.""Bear in mind that dorms are home to foreign workers,"" she added. ""Within dorms workers interact with each other very regularly, very closely, they're like family, so the risk of transmission was always there.""Workers will now not be able to prepare their own meals, to reduce human contact, and cleanliness and hygiene have been stepped up. Existing sick bays will also be scaled up to take care of workers that need to be isolated.",2020-09-04 20:30:00,hardwarezone,clusters inrecord 287 new pore links found mustafa centre clusters dormitoriesrecord 287 new pore links found mustafa centre clusters singapore singapore saw sharp spike 287 thursday april 9 majority linked highest daily number reported date brings total number 1 910 global number crossed 1 5 million mark coordinating minister national security teo chee hean advising multi ministry task force handling situation said national development minister lawrence wong noting police singapore armed forces saf involved operations cut chain transmission thousands healthy especially working essential services moved army camps floating hotels vacant housing board blocks singapore also started active case finding swab testing various said health ministry moh director medical services kenneth mak press conference thursday preliminary investigations linked cluster mustafa centre clusters construction site project glory five associate professor mak said ministry believes visited mustafa centre employees fallen ill got infected transmitted infection co subsequently infected others many mild symptoms continued work delay picking said mr wong chairs ministerial task force along health minister gan kim yong likely spreading time said mr wong said singapore dealing two separate infection spreads numbers rising sharply noted wider community numbers stable major urgent issue requires active intervention said decided put resources set dedicated task force focusing tuesday manpower ministry mom announced formation inter agency task force provide support operators task force ensure well improve living conditions supporting operators implement circuit breaker measures mom supported ministry health national environment agency saf singapore police force centre agencies explaining government decision set task force mr wong said cannot rely solely operators anymore given current situation manpower minister josephine teo noted no cluster recently even though number tested positive bear mind home added within interact regularly closely like family risk transmission always not able prepare meals reduce human contact cleanliness hygiene stepped existing sick bays also scaled take care need isolated,1.0

1032,">**Summary**
 
>Boys and girls, to conclude, I would like to summarize for you the key lessons that I would like you to remember:
 
>(a) Data has context. It’s not simply a matter of how many infected cases a country reports. You need to understand where the data comes from and how it is obtained. The capacity limits for COVID testing means that we need to be wary about believing the data and it is not because anyone is intentionally under-reporting.
 
>(b) Don’t just believe what people tell you. Just because people tell you that if the dorms were better everything would be ok, you don’t just believe them. You ask why should it be? Don’t just take at face value. Just because someone has a PhD, don’t just believe him. Heck, don’t even believe me. Derive everything again by yourself from first principles.
 
>(c) Learn to use imagination and do thought experiments. Someone tells you, if you only listened to me and did this, everything will be good. Well, you just happily imagine that they were right and ask yourself, then what? The problem with these big mouths who talk a lot is that they just shoot off their mouths. They have no accountability to actually do anything. They have no sense of perspective, no sense of the costs and no sense of the practical constraints.
 
>(d) Have a sense of perspective. We are not the only country to have massive numbers of foreign or migrant workers. I don’t believe that the living conditions of our foreigner workers are the worst in the world. Other countries have no COVID infections in their dorms or dorm-equivalents we think? Are people so naive? Note that as far as I know, we are the *only* country, where the PM has appeared on national TV to assure the foreign workers. To tell them, not worry, Singapore will take care of them. Think about that for a moment. 
 
>(e) School v Real Life. My complaint about school is that it often misleads our students into thinking that every problem has a model answer. Not true in life. There are situations where you know that sh*t is going to hit the fan and yet all you can do is to feel sorry for yourself while it happens in slomo. COVID19 is one such moment for Singapore.

I've lost count the number of times a dead animal corpse just lay there, being ran over with cars and who knows what bits and pieces of them are aerosolised and inhaled by me.

Hopefully, we catch that before the infected chickens reach the end consumer.

1185,"It's about the attitude the government has towards feedback and the vulnerable. That's what would have prevented this situation. 

The development of PBDs in 2015 were supposed to have reduced the risk and intensity of potential disease transmission. Today we acknowledge that they have become breeding dens for it. Three ministers of manpower from 2015 until now. 

Workers welfare has been an issue raised in the MSM in recent years. Spoiled meals delivered to construction sites and dorms, more expensive prices in dorm supermarkets, panel doctors giving too little MC so employers don't have to be marked for an accident. Inadequate action. 

March. Tourist spots close by themselves, since some tourist spots become clusters. Invisible hand of the market, nothing needs to be done. Construction sites don't close, when a few clusters appeared. 

Healthserve feedbacks that ruling for doctors to only practice at one location to prevent transmission means volunteer doctor numbers are gutted. No exemptions. (This means the govt did recognise that some workers shouldn't be travelling from place to place as they may spread disease. Another type of worker has already been spreading disease by now too. Hmm...) The forum letter on potential dorm vector. No visible action. 

April. Volunteer doctor mentions a sick worker who was able to keep his food down after getting Bengali food in MSM article on the incredible medical translation site that started with Bengali. We're still arguing about food now. Urgent begging for volunteers reveals that not enough staff in MOM, civil service and military know how to speak Bengali. MOM not working with HOME and TWC2. 

If the government had a more open attitude, they would be more transparent about what they have been doing in various sectors to prevent disease. Stakeholders like NGOs would have a back and forth. Assistants would point out pertinent concerns for ministers to address. FWs would know their rights clearly and feel safe reporting violations.

We would have had more healthcare staff in the public system since they weren't being mistreated. Transport services wouldn't have been cut. An information blast on how the enhanced CB was set to stop on 4 may and not June 1 would have been sent when bubble tea and haircut queues started to form. We wouldn't be wondering what a private citizen married to our PM is doing for an unknown salary.

Ok back to residential ratios. The point of a foreign worker levy is to make hiring foreign workers more costly, not exactly to earn tax revenue. If the standards were increased and levies cut, employers don't have to pay more. If it were easier for good, experienced workers to find work instead of having to leave when they lose their job, there wouldn't be a brain drain when the leave for elsewhere or go home and change jobs. We wouldn't be hiring indebted noobs to replace them several months later, reducing productivity. 

And so what if labour costs go up? How much of a contractors and developers costs are labour? How much would tenders have to go up? For BTOs, how much can HDB subsidise, perhaps in a targeted way? How much is the cost to our monthly mortgage? Let's stop with the fear mongering. The civil service should be calculating the forecasted costs like the independent Congressional Budget Office does in the US. 

I'm not well informed. I'm just asking questions, look for pieces of information to answer these questions, and try to make sense of what the situation. So I felt that the emotional dismissal of 'what about NS' needed some unpacking. Was the opinion that NSFs have it worse than FWs based on reality? Is this really a zero sum game? 

To fund this I'll have to talk about reserves, but I've spent too much time on this already. We are unique because we are tax haven that is good to live in. But what if we could become a more attractive place for VHNWIs and above without diluting our tax haven status too much? Do we need to be reinvesting our half of our returns? Do our reserves have to grow above GDP and inflation? How far ahead of every other country do we need to be in order to be satisfied? (Like SIA, it's fine not to be number 1 in some places but like Changi Airport, it's good to be number 1 in others.) Isn't Covid-19 a chance to have some exit from (sudden) sunset industries?

1198,"Yeah I’m surprised too that people think migrant worker dorms look like SAF bunks. Anyone who has seen how an average (read: not the worst) foreign worker dorm room looks like will surely not suggest such a comparison. IMHO, when compared to foreign worker dorms, SAF bunks will easily qualify as being five star standard. Not just the aspects of cleanliness or amenities (even just the basic need of having a working toilet), though those are very important factors, but I’ll put them aside since many would assume these aspects are due to the workers not taking care or keeping clean. 

I believe the key issue behind how fast the virus can spread in worker dorms, potentially making it a “petri dish” situation, aside from the lack of cleanliness and/or hygiene in a majority of the dorms, are the issues of poor ventilation and the severe lack of physical distancing. Most worker dorm rooms would pack say, three bunk beds within the size of a bedroom in an average HDB flat (the BTO ones, not the older flats), leaving only enough room for everyone to get up and down the beds. FWIK (from being a volunteer with ItsRainingRaincoats), most of the rooms also do not have any drawers/cupboards/wardrobes/storage. Most of the workers store their belongings in their one luggage bag which they store underneath the bottom bunks of their beds.

And by the way, about the issue of cleanliness, most migrant workers do clean up after themselves, but as with all communal living, it only takes one bad apple to ruin it for everyone else. Just to quote an example, I’ve once had a housemate (I’m a room renter) who was super gross, leaving food waste and used sanitary pads lying around in the open everywhere in the house, even all over the floor of her room. 🤮 *shuddering just from recalling 😖. So no, it’s not about one’s level of education.

1200,"> # Parliament: Two-thirds of dorm operators flout licensing conditions each year, says Josephine Teo

> SINGAPORE - Almost two-thirds of the 35 dormitory operators here are punished each year for breaching dormitory licensing conditions under the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act (Feda).

> This adds up to about 20 operators, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said in Parliament on Monday (May 4). These 35 firms run the 43 purpose-built dormitories housing some 200,000 foreign workers.

> Outside of large dormitories, an average of 1,200 employers a year have also been punished for providing unacceptable accommodation for their workers, said Mrs Teo, responding to questions from MPs, including Workers' Party MP Png Eng Huat (Hougang), who asked about the virus outbreak among foreign workers.

> She told the House that accommodation standards for migrant workers have become better over the years, but acknowledged that further improvements could be made.

> The living conditions in these large dormitories have been under scrutiny in recent weeks as the number of workers infected with Covid-19 rises.

> ""We will see how standards can be raised, but keep in mind there are also older dorms which perhaps might not have reached these standards yet,"" said Mrs Teo, after showing MPs pictures of living conditions in newer dormitories.

> The minister said that when lapses are found, these must be rectified immediately. Dorm operators can be fined up to $50,000, jailed for up to a year, or both for such offences.

> For other housing types, employers can be fined up to $10,000, face a jail term of up to one year, or both under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act.

> She pointed out that her ministry has about 100 dormitory inspectors who work under the supervision of the Commissioner for Foreign Employee Dormitories, two deputy commissioners and eight assistant commissioners. Last year, these officers conducted 1,200 inspections and 3,000 investigations across the different housing types in which foreign workers in Singapore are accommodated.

> Apart from the 200,000 workers housed in large dormitories, there are about 95,000 workers living in factory-converted dormitories. Most of these workers are from the construction, marine and process sectors.

> Another 20,000 workers are housed in temporary quarters on construction sites.

> Related Story New facilities to be built for workers in dorms who have recovered from Covid-19 or have mild symptoms

> There are also 85,000 work permit and S Pass holders from the construction sector who live in HDB flats, private residential premises and other sites.

> While the Covid-19 situation in large dormitories are ""largely stable now"", the situation in factory-converted dormitories and quarters at construction sites presents a mixed picture ""and (is) taking up much bandwidth"".

> Responding to concerns raised by MPs, Mrs Teo said the Government has ""taken steps to raise the housing standards of our migrant workers"" over the years.

> It passed Feda in 2015, which imposes higher standards on dormitories that accommodate 1,000 or more workers - the Act requires recreational facilities to be provided, as well as amenities like mini-marts and Wi-Fi in common areas.

> ""They are also required to have health facilities like sickbays or isolation rooms and draw up contingency plans for quarantine arrangements,"" she said, adding that the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) had asked all Feda-licensed dormitories to set aside at least 10 quarantine rooms each in February, which have proved useful for isolating close contacts in facilities with few infected workers.

> For smaller accommodation types that are not covered under Feda, they have to comply with regulations under different agencies, she said.

> Mrs Teo also took MPs through how workers came to be housed in such large dormitories, noting that as more construction workers from China, Bangladesh, Myanmar and India came to Singapore in the early 1990s, the Government allocated land for self-contained dormitories with recreational facilities to be built.

> Explaining the thinking behind housing them in these communal facilities, she said: ""One important consideration was what would a migrant worker want at the end of the work day, if he cannot be with his family? Well, it is to be with his friends, cook a meal he would like, practise his religious beliefs.""

> But she also said that such environments now carry the risk of significant Covid-19 transmission, and there was a need to relook how people interact in homes and workplaces.

> ""What changes will be effective in reducing the transmission risks? Will these changes require different space requirements and technical standards or stronger regulatory levers that Mr Louis Ng (Nee Soon GRC) asked about?"" she said.

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> ""When this is over, we will reflect and thoroughly look into areas where we could have done better, so that we will be better prepared the next time.""

> She told members that Singapore has a responsibility to its migrant workers, many of whom have made personal sacrifices to come to work in Singapore and contribute to its development.

> ""We will do everything within our means to make sure that they too win the fight against Covid-19, and reunite with their families in time to come,"" she said.

1329,"I edited my post. It's clear that army dorms are not like FW dorms. Let's not talk about camps first, as Tekong dorms, where we are confined for 2 weeks and cannot get a breather by booking out, have to be arranged ro reduce transmission of disease. They are more spacious and have excellent ventilation with windows and ceiling fans at max speed. 

The distancing between and across bunk beds is greater than in the Purpose Built Dormitories. In PBDs, the headboards are placed headboard to headboard. Their head is so close to their neighbours' feet. Even in camps there's greater space between bunks,  and a wardrobe. In PBDs, their barang is on the bed, floor, and s-hook. The cookhouse is also well ventilated. 

Some people may see the pictures and videos of PBDs and somehow believe it is similar to their NS experience. Got camera angle one ok! You think the MSM won't try to make dorms look as spacious as possible? Photos look very artistic also. At home see PBD and army bunks all can seem very nice. There's definitely a difference when you're there.

There is fundamentally a difference between housing in camps and dorms. The number of men in a bunk fluctuates and is getting smaller in general due to decreased manpower in the military from smaller cohorts. Dorm operators are incentivised to keep occupancy at maximum. Even for stay-in, when others book out there's more space. Dorms no book out. And other than the extreme minority with no home outside the camp, we still have a home to look forward to and enjoy.

1339,"There are two components to the dorm problem which you do not clearly differentiate. One is the problem specific to COVID, which is that no special measures were taken to properly social distance the workers and ensure that adequate hygiene protocols were put into place. In my opinion, the government really dropped the ball on this one - they were quick to implement such policies for schools but did not foresee the same issue for dorms. This is what NGOs alerted them to at the onset of the crisis. However, they still failed to act on time, which is unforgivable in my eyes.

Secondly, there's a more wide ranging issue of poor conditions in dorms. This is what NGOs have been campaigning the government for years, but conditions remain poor. Nobody is asking for 5 star hotel accomodation for foreign workers, despite whatever strawman Ben Leong cooked up. However, it is undeniable that conditions are poor and fail to meet international standards. This is an issue which is only tangentially related to the dorm infections, but has been brought under the spotlight due to the infections, and rightfully so.

In the longer term, all FWs would vacate the dormitories to facilitate upgrade / deep cleaning. The potential upsides:1. Preserve mental wellbeing and improve living environment of FWs.2. Ease the pressure on healthcare system. 3. Provide business for economy.4. Reduce potential of riot.  Police could be deployed for other purposes e.g. contact tracing.  The potential downsides:1. Potential new clusters as Sars-Cov-19 might not be detected with what we have.  To mitigate the risk of transmission, FWs are to be isolated after work.

1435,"Its kind of hard to just push the blame to dormitory operators (DO) though. It's easy to say that the company could've provided solution. But solution cost money and who's footing the bill.

DOs usually does some form of optimization just like hospitals and hotels. What are the demands? How do we balance between quality and cost. I believe that you wouldn't expect DOs to operate at a loss unless they're doing charity and expected to make some profit.

Say that I open a dormitory with better facilities, everyone gets more space and place is cleaned regularly and better than others. Do you think that I will be capable of charging the same amount as what the other, lousier dormitories are charging?

Lemma: If I'm chosing a dormitory, would I pick a dormitory with poorer condition at the same price? Would DOs that charge exorbitant amount for poor condition survive? Those on the news are unsurprisingly cheaper than the rest in general.

Then you might say that, why not just set a requirement to make the conditions better. Then again who is paying for it? If it is no longer attractive to operate or invest in operating dormitories, how do we get people to do it? If the cost increases, are the workers suppose to pay for the increase? Or are the employers expected to absorb the fee? Or will the employers pass on the cost to their customers. And we have another recurring problem.

Then how are we going to ensure that cost of housing and maintenance does not increase if the cost is passed on the employers? How are we going to help those whos affected by this change?

Obviously, this would increase social distancing and *maybe* help somewhat. **But guess what? The workers will still be eating together and working together.

The below part is very true. But up for yourself to judge.

In a media release, MOM said enhanced measures and cleaning routines had been put in place at the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, Westlite Toh Guan Dormitory, Toh Guan Dormitory and Sungei Tengah Lodge.At these isolation areas, workers are quarantined in their rooms for a two-week period as part of efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. They also receive onsite medical support and enhanced health screening.COVID-19 infections have spiked in foreign worker dormitories recently, with cases linked to 10 such dormitories across the island. Out of Singapore's 2,108 COVID-19 cases, more than 500 cases are linked to dormitories.Photos and videos circulating on social media earlier this week appeared to show crowded and unsanitary conditions at the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol -  currently the largest coronavirus cluster in Singapore, with 306 cases. MOM said it had instituted enhanced waste management and sanitation regimes at the four isolation areas. The frequency of refuse collection and removal from the premises for disposal have been increased from once a day to three to five times daily, depending on the premises, said the ministry. It noted that disinfection and cleaning of common areas and washroom facilities are also being carried out an average of thrice a day at the four isolation areas. These measures will also be introduced at the Tampines Dormitory - where are there currently 49 COVID-19 cases - which was also gazetted as the fifth such isolation area on Friday. MOM also noted that dormitory operators had been working with external vendors as well as in-house cleaners to improve the cleanliness and sanitation in the dorms. The measures taken include increasing the rounds of cleaning at the dormitories up to five times a day and getting additional to clean frequently used areas such as toilets and corridors. External vendors have also been engaged to clear rubbish at the isolation areas, as well as increasing the frequency of disinfecting from twice to four times daily.  MOM officers have been working round the clock at the dormitories gazetted as isolation areas to ensure the foreign workers well-being is taken care of and the living conditions are of the highest standards, said the ministry. It added it would act on feedback provided by dormitory residents to determine possible areas of improvements. In a video posted on his Facebook page on Friday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Singapore was paying close attention to the welfare of foreign workers, amid the COVID-19 outbreak. ""They came to Singapore to work hard for a living, and provide for their families back home ...

1500,"> # COVID-19: Singapore to build new dormitories, improve living conditions for migrant workers

> SINGAPORE: The Government will construct new foreign worker dormitories as part of plans to reduce the current density in these accommodations.

> 

> By the end of this year, the authorities will create additional space to house about 60,000 workers, the Ministry of National Development (MND) and the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said in a joint media release on Monday (Jun 1).

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> These include Quick Build Dormitories (QBDs) that can be constructed “quite quickly” in a modular form with a low density. These QBDs can last for about two to three years and can house about 25,000 people in total.

> Eight sites have been earmarked for new QBDs by the end of 2020, including in Kranji, Tuas, Admiralty, Choa Chu Kang and Tampines.

> 

> Unused state properties, including former schools and vacant factories, will be fitted out temporarily to house about 25,000 workers, and the authorities are talking to contractors to build more construction temporary quarters, which are makeshift dormitories that keep the workers near their worksite.

> 

> Some of the state properties that will be refurbished include the former Bedok North Secondary School building, the former Anderson Junior College Hostel and tents at the National Service Resort and country club in Kranji.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> As part of longer-term plans, the Government is planning to build new purpose-built dormitories (PBDs) over the next few years that can house up to 100,000 workers. These dormitories, which will have amenities such as minimarts and barber services, will replace the temporary accommodations built this year.

> 

> About 11 PBDs will be ready in the next ""one to two years"", the media release said. Workers living in the PBDs will also have ready access to medical care and support.

> 

> ""With these additional PBDs in place, we will also have the capacity to decant

> workers from the existing dormitories, and to undertake major upgrading to these

> dormitories to ensure that they meet the new standards,"" the ministries said.

> Besides expanding housing availability for foreign workers, government agencies are developing a set of specifications for these new dormitories, the ministries added.

> 

> These specifications will look into the design, facilities, management and regulation of these dormitories, and will factor in social interaction and disease response needs.

> 

> “In land scarce Singapore, dormitories are a practical approach to housing our migrant workers,” the media release said.

> 

> “We aim to make dormitory living and design more resilient to public health risks including pandemics, with improved living standards that are benchmarked both domestically and internationally.

> 

> “We will take on board lessons learnt from the current COVID pandemic, and also seek feedback from relevant stakeholders.”

> 

> Some of the present set of standards that will be improved as part of a pilot include increasing the living space per resident from a minimum of 4.5 sqm per resident, including shared facilities, to at least 6 sqm, not including shared facilities.

> 

> There will also be a maximum occupancy rate of up to 10 beds per room. Currently, there are no limits - the ministries noted that in practice, there are about 12-16 beds in each room.

> 

> The new set of requirements will see only single-deck beds being used, with 1m spacing between the beds.

> More toilets and bathrooms will also be built so that there is at least one bathroom, sink and toilet for every five beds, instead of every 15 beds.

> 

> The Government is also studying the possibility of developing the new PBDs on a different model compared to the present system, where currently land is released for the commercial operators to bid, build or operate.

> 

> ""While the physical standards are being improved, it is equally important to uplift the capabilities of dormitory operators and make adjustments to the daily living habits of the dormitory residents,"" the ministries said.

> ""Everyone must do their part to minimise the risk of infection clusters. The pilot will therefore also seek to instil a new level of discipline on safe living within dormitories.""

> The ministries noted that cost will go up alongside these new housing arrangements, “but they will keep the workers safe and allow Singaporeans to continue benefiting from their contributions"".

> 

> The media release also said that some of the dormitories will be located closer to residential areas given the country’s land constraints.

> ""Singaporeans must therefore do our part too. We must reject the Not in My Backyard (NIMBY) mindset and instead appreciate these workers who keep Singapore going,"" the ministries said.

1597,"> # Fake videos being spread to create trouble in foreign worker dorms, risk 'serious' law and order incidents: Shanmugam

> SINGAPORE: Some people are deliberately spreading fake videos to ""foment trouble"" in foreign worker dormitories, Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said on Wednesday (Apr 29).

> These videos can lead to serious law and order incidents, he said, adding that the authorities were watching individuals who spread the videos ""very carefully"" and will charge them if a crime was committed.

> 

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> His comments come as hundreds of thousands of foreign workers have been barred from leaving their dorms to curb the spread of COVID-19, as they make up a majority of Singapore's new cases each day.

> Amid this situation, Mr Shanmugam said a number of fake and ""very malicious"" videos were circulating on social media, with one suggesting that a Bangladeshi worker in Singapore had committed suicide because of a lack of money and work.

> 

> Another video purportedly showed two men of South Asian origin fighting in a dorm in Singapore, when in fact the incident took place in Dubai, Mr Shanmugam said.

> Advertisement

> Advertisement

> ""It's to create panic, unhappiness, anger and hopefully violence,"" Mr Shanmugam told reporters via video conference. ""When people panic in such situations and get angry, they can of course riot.""

> Mr Shanmugam said the videos also serve to make Singaporeans believe that foreign workers here were being treated badly, despite authorities ensuring they continued to get paid, three meals a day and ""first-class medical treatment"".

> 

> The minister acknowledged that while it was impossible that every worker would be satisfied with the quality of the free meals, a ""majority of them"" said the quality of the food they received was good.

> ""But even now, people are deliberately circulating old photographs of food packets; sometimes food being thrown away from some places, not necessarily Singapore, and saying, 'you see, these workers are being ill-treated',"" he said.

> 

> ""And also encouraging them to come out and complain, even when there's nothing to complain about.""

> Mr Shanmugam said the authorities were watching the people who spread these videos and photos ""very closely"" and added ""where it's clearly criminal, we will charge"".

> However, he declined to give details on how many people were being investigated for circulating such posts, only adding that they comprised both locals and foreigners.

> 

> Mr Shanmugam reiterated that such posts could lead to ""serious"" law and order situations, including a ""riot-like situation"".

> ""You can see that when people are together and they are not going out to work, a small spark can create a serious incident,"" he said, referring to the Little India riots that took place in 2013.

> ""We need to be very careful. We are taking care of them, but at the same time they can be stoked into anger, creating law and order incidents through the use of falsehoods.""

Even if well after 14 days, the person should stay within premises for another week to ensure symptom doesn't show again. - Trace their movement for past 14 days which should be easy.

1612,"I shall reproduce Ben Leong's full post below for your reading convenience, since OP only posted the summary.

>I hope everyone is doing well. This past Semester has been quite a harrowing one and being cooped up at home for so long is making me really edgy. I am writing this note because I found one of my students sharing this note by one Dr Tan Meng Wah, with the comment “Good read.” I read, and I was horrified that my student thought it was a good read. 
 
>I think it’s drivel and I am well-aware of the Streisand Effect, but still I would encourage everyone to read it, before reading what I have to say. Always good to read two sides of the story and then decide. Don’t just listen to one side. 
 
>This note will be TL;DR, but given the complexities of what we will be discussing, cannot be helped. 
 
>**Pre-Amble (Can Skip)**
 
>And given the complex environment that is the Internet today, allow me to start with the following pre-amble to provide some context and some disclaimers. 
 
>1. This note is written mainly for my students because I think it is important for them to learn how to make sense of life and what happens, from first gathers “facts” and then analyzing the situation from first principles. It should be clear why I think that this COVID19 crisis presents us with a good teaching moment. 
 
>2. This is a very unpleasant note to write, because I will effectively be defending the Government. That’s something that’s almost as cool as having to wipe my 5-year-old’s behind every couple of hours after he poops because of CB (never had to do this before. :’(). Ordinarily, I wouldn’t bother to defend the Government, because I am not paid enough to do that. But these are not ordinary times. We don’t have enough reasonable voices saying reasonable things. We need more sense making during this time of confusion and anxiety. For this reason, I thought I better step up and say something. Earlier, I was also too swamped with work and e-exams.
 
>3. Declaration of potential conflict of interest: I am currently tangentially involved in the nation’s COVID19 efforts. SAF has been activated. SAF approached me because I have certain specialized skills and I am now effectively the commander of a small group of literally “keyboard warriors” supporting SAF, to support MOH in our (manual) contact tracing processes. The reason why I am declaring this is not because I want to pretend to be some kind of hero. We are not. My students and I are playing a v v small and insignificant part. All credit goes to the real frontliners who are wearing PPE fighting the virus daily. I am declaring this because if I don’t, and some kaypoh learns about this later, I will get accused of being some kind of PAP mole sent by the COVID Taskforce to do PR. Such is the perilous nature of the internet this days. Do good also scared people find out. Allow me to make clear that my team and I are the grunts. We don’t get anywhere close to dunno what Ministerial Task Force. I want to clarify that I have had no access whatsoever to any kind of privileged information and everything that I will be talking about in this post comes from information that is publicly available online.
 
>**Let’s Role-Play MTF**
 
>Dr Tan wrote a lot of the usual opposition drivel about how the Government is bad and the PAP is incompetent. I am not going to be bothered to address those. I am not sure that there’s anything new there and the Government can jolly well deal with it when they are done fighting COVID. Not my problem. I will keep my analysis to COVID19 related issues. 
 
>To better understand the crisis and how to deal with the crisis, let’s pretend for a moment that we’re the Ministerial Task Force (MTF) for COVID19.
 
>It is now Jan 2020. Wuhan is burning and it is in lockdown. We know that this is going to be a problem. We don’t know what we are dealing with exactly. We kiasi, quickly ban Wuhan, then we ban China and we form this dunno what MTF. 
 
>We don’t know what’s happening yet because the Chinese are too busy keeping their people from dying and studies have not been done. What do we assume? At this point, there are 2 choices: (i) we assume it’s going to kill us like SARS; and (ii) we can go with POTUS that this is just a “Chinese flu”. 
 
>We’re Singaporeans. Don’t be ridiculous. Of course we kiasi and assume SARS. We open the drawer and take out SARS SOP and execute. 
 
>Singapore’s ability to execute SOP is breath-taking. Clearly, if COVID19 were SARS, COVID19 would have been wiped out many times over. 
 
>To be fair, our initial execution was flawless. We were proclaimed the world’s Gold standard. So far, so good. 
 
>**To Mask or Not to Mask, That is the Question**
 
>This is where a lot of self-proclaimed geniuses will tell you that the Government had failed when it told the population that they didn’t have to wear masks and then had to U-turn. 4 doctors had come out to say that they advocated the wearing of masks in Feb 2020. Why didn’t the Government listen? 
 
>This is where I will take a short break to scold the Government for saying that no need to wear masks because “masks not required.” Siao. You tell my grandma that it’s not effective my grandma also won’t believe you. How can be not effective? If not effective, the medical personnel wear masks for what? To look good ah?
 
>Hold that thought.
 
>At the same time, there are also complaints that supply of masks running out. People complain cannot buy masks. 
 
>People don’t know this *that* time, but we later know because of Madam Ho, what happened at the same time was that while ST had a N95 factory line and were ready to ship masks back to Singapore, Taiwan had banned us from exporting the masks back to Singapore? Do we announce this to the public so that we can all be pissed at Taiwan together? No cannot. Must diam diam. We announce this, we will create panic*. 
 
> \*For now, all don’t panic and worry about masks -- confirm got enough: -will-have-too-many-mask-making-factories. Quality might be a problem but the supply is there. 
 
>Let’s come back to this question: should we make it compulsory to wear masks? This question needs to be answered at 2 levels

>(i) Suppose we did make it compulsory to wear masks, and remember, this was pre-CB, so everyone is out as per normal. That means we will burn ~5 million masks a day. Dr Tan talks so much. Where is he and all the others who talk a lot going to cough up the masks? Talk is cheap hor. Keep in mind that our “supposed” friends are screwing us over and we don’t dare to announce publicly. If people want to know why we didn’t stockpile 5 million x 365 days worth of masks, don’t have to put up PQ, I tell you. SARS SOP didn’t need that. So yes, the PAP Government was not omniscient enough to know we will have COVID19 this year. Damn lousy lah. People should vote Dr Tan in next GE. He is clearly omniscient. Did anyone calculate how much 5 million x 365 days worth of masks would have cost us if COVID19 didn’t happen? 
 
>(ii) For the second level, did we *really* think we need to make everyone wear masks? It might be surprising that this is even a question, but it is -- and this is what separates the people who actually learnt something about probability in school and those who only know how to answer exam questions. 
 
>This is Jan-Feb 2020. Singapore has activated the world’s most efficient contact tracing system. Every single infected one we catch, we send to NCID. All their friends kenna quarantined. It seemed to work. That’s why we’re the gold standard. What does that mean? That means that even though we know there are likely some infected people that we haven’t yet identified and caught, we don’t expect them to be many. Conservatively, let’s say 100. With hindsight, that’s maybe too small, but at *that* point, that’s as good as it gets.
 
>What is 100? Roughly, that’s probably the number of MediaCorp actors and actresses we have? I suspect MediaCorp has more. How often do you get to meet Zoe Tay or Fann Wong? I have never seen them in person in my life. 
 
>Note that you can only catch COVID from someone who has been infected. If there are only 100 of them running around, your probability of getting hemorrhoids is likely higher. 
 
>Let’s use an army analogy to make the situation more obvious. The masks are like bullets. If you are not likely to meet the enemy, you shoot the bullets for what? Conserve bullets when when they are needed and only the people likely to meet the enemy, i.e. firstline healthcare workers, should wear masks loh. 
 
>In other words, not wearing masks was the correct and most logical choice at that point. What other choice do people think we have? All wear masks, masks come from where? Dr Tan refers to this situation as a political consideration. Not enough masks is not enough masks simi sai political situation? Dr Tan and his 4 doctors can supply ah? 
 
>Basically, on the mask wearing issue, the Government did get the answer right (it was judged both impractical and of not urgent need), but got the working wrong, so kenna marked wrong. 
 
>Dr Tan mentioned that “To solve the shortage problem, the Government approached 400 suppliers in about 20 countries to buy more masks. At the same time, volunteers and female inmates from the Correctional Services were mobilized to help boost production of masks to 90,000 a day or 2.5 million masks a month.” 
 
>Implication is what? Singapore Government sleeping on the job and never go and try to buy masks? Well, what’s that ugly that looks like a bra, but not quite, in our house now? Dr Tan provide one or Hong Kong government procure for us he thinks?

1658,"Firstly, before this covid started, there were already outbreaks of infectious diseases like chicken pox in the dorms, at least 3 years ago. No visible action was taken to prevent such issues from happening again.

Then some organisations had warned, at the start of covid, the risks again. Still no visible action.

Then one FW got Covid. They managed to isolate him. This was back in Feb.

At that time there wasn't any indication of CB happening in future, and masks were not yet mandated, SHN had breaches and many who had to serve SHN were saying instructions were unclear. I believe you know this part.

Then all of a sudden our cases started picking up, with the dorms starting to get affected. Then CB, up to now.

Basically, everything that was done and wasn't, as above, led to the situation we see in the dorms now.

But what could have been prevented was if clearer enforcement were in place, and if FW dorms policies were strict enough. Additionally, many FWs seem to have reservations about seeking medical treatment, but I think it's possible that they are afraid of their employers coming down on them. There were even cases of Employers who initially wanted to send all their workers for the free covid tests so that they could potentially get some money from the govt. So another thing about enforcement by the MOM. 

But the main thing was, if it wasn't for the fact that despite a track history of infectious disease outbreaks, nothing much was seemingly done (at least a documentation or open plans in place for such a situation for the dorms, that unfortunately has finally happened), we would be in a different situation today.

That's the reason employers of FDWs are very very scared and silent about it...no wonder lah...Conclusion bad move and decision by MOM...Coronavirus: Employers who send healthy workers to hospitals for Covid-19 test may get work pass privileges suspended, warns MOMSINGAPORE - Do not send employees to hospitals unless there is a medical emergency, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has warned employers, after hospitals reported that employers were dropping off workers to have them tested for the coronavirus.""Employers who act irresponsibly by misusing medical facilities may have their work pass privileges suspended,"" it added.In a message sent to employers seen by The Straits Times on Wednesday (Feb 19), Mr Kevin Teoh, divisional director of MOM's foreign manpower management division, said the ministry had been getting feedback from hospitals that employers were sending their workers to be tested for Covid-19, as the disease is now known.ST has contacted the Health Ministry for more information on the extent of such behaviour.Mr Teoh reminded employers that hospitals will not test individuals who are well.""This is to ensure that medical facilities and resources are focused on unwell individuals who need medical treatment,"" he said.A worker who is unwell should be sent to a general practitioner, who will then assess if the worker needs to be taken to hospital.""Our hospitals are working hard to ensure that medical emergencies are handled promptly,"" said Mr Teoh.""We encourage you to be socially responsible and only send workers to the hospital if it is a medical emergency, as doing so otherwise will deny immediate treatment to those who need it.""He added that employers should monitor the health of their workers by checking their temperature twice daily and reminding them to observe good personal hygiene, such as washing their hands with soap frequently. MOM has been taking employers and workers to task for not following rules restricting workers’  entry and movements when returning from China.For example, it revoked the work passes of two workers and suspended their employers’ work pass privileges on Thursday (Feb 13) for breaching entry approval requirements.On Feb 9, it repatriated four work pass holders and suspended six employers for not complying with Leave of Absence rules.On Monday, the Government introduced the Stay-Home Notice scheme which requires all who return from China not to leave their homes for 14 days.MOM said the scheme also applies to all work pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China.This is stricter than the previous Leave of Absence scheme, where people could still leave their residence briefly for food and other necessities. ...-hospitals-for",2020-04-15 16:30:00,hardwarezone,lol mom really look foolish omg reason employers fdws scared silent no wonder conclusion bad move decision mom employers send healthy hospitals test may get work pass privileges suspended warns momsingapore not send employees hospitals unless medical emergency ministry manpower mom warned employers hospitals reported employers dropping tested employers act irresponsibly misusing medical facilities may work pass privileges suspended added message sent employers seen straits times wednesday feb mr kevin teoh divisional director mom manpower management division said ministry getting feedback hospitals employers sending tested disease known st contacted health ministry information extent behaviour mr teoh reminded employers hospitals not test individuals well ensure medical facilities resources focused unwell individuals need medical treatment said unwell should sent general practitioner assess needs taken hospital hospitals working hard ensure medical emergencies handled promptly said mr teoh encourage socially responsible send hospital medical emergency otherwise deny immediate treatment need added employers should monitor health checking temperature twice daily reminding observe good personal hygiene washing hands soap frequently mom taking employers task not following rules restricting entry movements returning china example revoked work passes two suspended employers work pass privileges thursday feb 13 breaching entry approval requirements feb 9 repatriated four work pass holders suspended six employers not complying leave absence rules monday government introduced stay home notice scheme requires return china not leave homes 14 days mom said scheme also applies work pass holders recent travel history mainland china stricter previous leave absence scheme people could still leave residence briefly food necessities hospitals,1.0

1769,"SINGAPORE  Foreign workers have been in the authorities sight early on in the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore at the start of the year, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on Monday (4 May).Delivering a ministerial statement in Parliament, she explained how the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) helped to prevent imported cases by limiting the return of work pass holders and monitoring returnees compliance with Leaves of Absence and Stay-Home Notices, among other things.Throughout this period, migrant workers were also on our radar, said Teo.Back in January, soon after the multi-ministry task force was set up, MOM reached out to dormitory operators to be more vigilant and to step up hygiene. In fact, one of the earliest media conferences that Minister Lawrence Wong and I held was at the Tuas View Dormitory, after we inspected their quarantine facilities in early February, she said.Wong helms the National Development Ministry and co-chairs the Multi-Ministry Taskforce tackling the spread of the virus.Teo added, We produced materials in the workers native languages to encourage them to take steps to protect themselves. Subsequently, non-essential facilities in the dormitories like gyms and TV rooms were closed. Meal-times and recreational hours were staggered. Intermixing between blocks was stopped.MOM officers also fanned out on weekends, to advise migrant workers to observe safe distancing measures and disperse big groups that were gathering at popular hangouts.Narrow focus on rooming arrangements may not prevent recurrenceIn February, the authorities detected the first COVID-19 cluster involving migrant workers at a construction site at Seletar Aerospace Heights. The five workers stayed at five different locations, only two of which were dormitories, Teo noted.Thereafter, there was no indication of higher prevalence of COVID-19 among migrant workers, compared to the general community, she said.Several MPs had raised queries on the outbreak of COVID-19 in dormitories. Jurong GRC MP Ang Wei Neng asked, among other things, about the lessons to be drawn from the management of dormitories and if safe distancing can be practically practised in the existing purpose-built dormitories.Meanwhile, Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng asked if MOM would consider raising the minimum gross floor area of 4.5 square metres for each resident in a foreign workers' dormitory; and not including the basic living facilities - such as living quarters, kitchen, dining, and toilet areas - in the computation for the minimum gross floor area.Nominated MPs Walter Theseira and Anthea Ong also asked if a Committee of Inquiry would be appointed to probe the COVID-19 outbreak in the dormitories.Responding, Teo said epidemiological findings show that within the dormitories which have clusters, not all blocks or rooms are equally affected. And across the different dormitories, infected workers were linked via common work sites.At the work sites, it was not uncommon for the infected workers to take breaks together, share food and utensils. Likewise, infected workers from different dormitories had gathered during their rest days to socialise and shop, for example at Mustafa. Back in the dormitories, workers spent time with their friends, cooking, eating and relaxing together, said Teo.The virus may have spread through all of these activities, much like how it spread among family members, religious groups and even colleagues, she added.Teo also noted that most infected workers showed mild symptoms of the virus and that many cases were uncovered only due to active case-finding or swab-taking.This may explain why up to the middle of March, the cases of workers at the dormitories testing positive were few and far between. Once evidence emerged that the virus had spread in the dormitories, we decided to deal with it squarely and quickly, and mobilise whole-of-government resources, the minister said.She added, Multiple channels of transmission among migrant workers, as appear to be the case, also means that we need a multi-faceted approach to dealing with the outbreak. A narrow focus on rooming arrangements may not prevent a recurrence. This consideration underpins the comprehensive approach of the Taskforce.-19-m...083406682.htmlHow the F is that a response to the question?!

1806,"Hmm. I think sg has been pushing pretty hard for productivity drive tho, don't you think so?

But for construction and Maintenance ops, it's really difficult to push for productivity. Can send ppl for training all they want but sometimes it's just hard for employees to translate training into actual productivity increase on the ground. I think HDB tries to also push some productivity innovations to private contractors when they build HDB flats (a good portion of flats are already built using pre-fabricated parts in fact) but there's a lot of friction. BCA is pushing a lot for more use of tech in construction as well.

At the end of the day, right now at least it's a lot to do with sgprn mindset. Let's say even for yourself, if someone offered you or your friends to work as a construction supervisor that is in charge introducing govt backed digital initiatives onto the ground workers will you wanna take it up haha? I don't think many ppl would at this juncture. 


Thus, I agree that we should back off of cheap labour. But I think it's unfair to think that Govt has not been pushing hard for it. At the end of the day, a big part of all this is also really up to the private contractors and if you push them too hard they may not even want to bother working on public projects anymore or find a deluge of stringent productivity requirements too hard for them to survive.

Yes, I definitely agree with you regarding the treatment of workers. Majority of these workers are some of the nicest people I've met. Most of the time they are very friendly and some even offer their assistance when I'm doing my work. One of my most memorable experiences is that one of the workers even asked me if I wanted coffee because he wanted to make it for me. I work mostly in people's homes and don't expect much from anyone but some Singaporeans really treated me like a dog while these foreign workers treated me as a friend. Most of the time when I'm there I always ask if their bosses treat them well and I've not heard anyone say bad things about their bosses. Some even tell me their bosses bring them out to eat and pay for them as well. So I'm grateful and thankful that not all bosses treat their workers as dispensable like what you mentioned. 
One thing I cannot get over is that there is a minority of people taking advantage of the foreign workers by preying on their gullibility and lack of knowledge. For example some rooms have WiFi extenders which obviously are not needed but the workers are convinced to buy them because of salespersons simply telling them that the product is good and that they need it for ""better"" WiFi all for the sake of commission.",2020-04-08 08:57:39,reddit,yes definitely agree regarding treatment majority nicest people met time friendly even offer assistance work one memorable experiences one even asked wanted coffee wanted make work mostly people homes expect much anyone singaporeans really treated like dog treated friend time always ask bosses treat well not heard anyone say bad things bosses even tell bosses bring eat pay well grateful thankful not bosses treat dispensable like mentioned one thing cannot get minority people taking advantage preying gullibility lack knowledge example rooms wifi extenders obviously not needed convinced buy salespersons simply telling product good need better wifi sake commission,1.0

That's the reason employers of FDWs are very very scared and silent about it...no wonder lah...Conclusion bad move and decision by MOM...Coronavirus: Employers who send healthy workers to hospitals for Covid-19 test may get work pass privileges suspended, warns MOMSINGAPORE - Do not send employees to hospitals unless there is a medical emergency, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) has warned employers, after hospitals reported that employers were dropping off workers to have them tested for the coronavirus.""Employers who act irresponsibly by misusing medical facilities may have their work pass privileges suspended,"" it added.In a message sent to employers seen by The Straits Times on Wednesday (Feb 19), Mr Kevin Teoh, divisional director of MOM's foreign manpower management division, said the ministry had been getting feedback from hospitals that employers were sending their workers to be tested for Covid-19, as the disease is now known.ST has contacted the Health Ministry for more information on the extent of such behaviour.Mr Teoh reminded employers that hospitals will not test individuals who are well.""This is to ensure that medical facilities and resources are focused on unwell individuals who need medical treatment,"" he said.A worker who is unwell should be sent to a general practitioner, who will then assess if the worker needs to be taken to hospital.""Our hospitals are working hard to ensure that medical emergencies are handled promptly,"" said Mr Teoh.""We encourage you to be socially responsible and only send workers to the hospital if it is a medical emergency, as doing so otherwise will deny immediate treatment to those who need it.""He added that employers should monitor the health of their workers by checking their temperature twice daily and reminding them to observe good personal hygiene, such as washing their hands with soap frequently. MOM has been taking employers and workers to task for not following rules restricting workers’  entry and movements when returning from China.For example, it revoked the work passes of two workers and suspended their employers’ work pass privileges on Thursday (Feb 13) for breaching entry approval requirements.On Feb 9, it repatriated four work pass holders and suspended six employers for not complying with Leave of Absence rules.On Monday, the Government introduced the Stay-Home Notice scheme which requires all who return from China not to leave their homes for 14 days.MOM said the scheme also applies to all work pass holders with recent travel history to mainland China.This is stricter than the previous Leave of Absence scheme, where people could still leave their residence briefly for food and other necessities. ...-hospitals-forI remember reading this news I was like wtf.

2014,"This seems more realistic. From a game-theoretic standpoint, if all other firms are housing workers using the lowest-cost method possible, then as an individual firm you can't hope to survive in the long run while still giving workers more living space and taking more safety precautions. And even if all the dorm operators willingly go above and beyond the minimum safety regulations, everyone has an incentive to deviate and squeeze more workers into one room. So there's something like a prisoner's dilemma and the point of failure here is really regulation, not individual firms.

You could argue that by making dorm operators bear the cost of treatment, they will internalise the costs and risks involved in squeezing so many workers into one space. But the social costs of a pandemic are way higher than the private costs of treatment: you're making them pay for the cost of treating each infected individual but you're not making them pay for the cost of them spreading the virus to others. So in equilibrium you'll still see not enough precautions being taken. And I would argue that with black swan events like a pandemic that happen so infrequently and have so many unknown unknowns, even if you impose a fine for each infected case that truly reflects the social cost of the pandemic, I don't think it is realistic to think that this will induce dorm operators to take the right precautions.",2020-04-14 17:00:36,reddit,seems realistic game theoretic standpoint firms housing using lowest cost method possible individual firm hope survive long run still giving living space taking safety precautions even operators willingly go beyond minimum safety regulations everyone incentive deviate squeeze one room something like prisoner dilemma point failure really regulation not individual firms could argue making operators bear cost treatment internalise costs risks involved squeezing many one space social costs pandemic way higher private costs treatment making pay cost treating infected individual not making pay cost spreading others equilibrium still see not enough precautions taken would argue black swan events like pandemic happen infrequently many unknown unknowns even impose fine infected case truly reflects social cost pandemic think realistic think induce operators take right precautions,1.0

2018,"Gold standard no more? Singapores response to the Covid-19 outbreak begins to tarnish-standa...ns-to-tarnish/SingaporeOnce considered the gold standard by many nations for its measures to address the coronavirus outbreak, the Singaporean Government is now facing criticism due to the rising number of local cases confirmed for Covid-19, as well as other issues that have recently surfaced, including poor living conditions at foreign workers dormitories, where 70 percent of new coronavirus cases are linked.Activists previously sounded the alarm that the overcrowded dormitories of migrant workers would be a threat to public health, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) reports.Singapores foreign workers dormitories are home to around 200,000 individuals employed in construction and other industries. Medical and logistics staff have been assigned to man outbreaks in these dormitories, and a new task force for the specific purpose of looking after the migrant workers was formed, headed by Teo Chee Hean, Singapores senior minister in charge of security.PM Lee assured the public in a video message posted on social media last week that the well-being of the foreign workers would be attended to.We have worked with their employers to make sure they will be paid their salaries, and can remit money home. We will provide them with the medical care and treatment they need, he added.However, others wonder if these measures could have been implemented earlier. Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), a workers rights group, had written a letter to The Straits Times (ST) on March 23, asking the Government to disclose their plan of action in case a mass infection should break out in the dormitories of migrant workers, which would assure the resident and non-resident community.While the issue of the welfare of migrant workers is not a new one, it has galvanized many Singaporeans into action, and more and more have commented on it, giving rise to a national debate.Veteran Tommy Koh wrote on Monday (Apr 7) that the way Singapore treats its foreign workers is not First World but Third World, in response to an ST article concerning the unhygienic and overcrowded conditions in foreign workers dormitories, while social media influencer and YouTube comic Preeti Nair, more popularly known as Preetipls, in six days raised more than twice the goal amount of $100,000 she had aimed to donate to HealthServe and TWC2 to help migrant workers.Local activist for foreign worker communities Kokila Annamalai took to Facebook to highlight the poor quality of meals the quarantined migrant workers had been receiving, with many netizens are taking up the same cry. Ms Kokila compared the meals the foreign workers were receiving to the ones that expatriates serving Stay Home Notices in posh hotels were being given.

2032,"I'll say again: I see little justification by NGOs to keep calling for more donations and more governmental resources when so much effort has already been made over the past two weeks to:

1) implement social distancing in dorms that pass standards,

2) Rehouse workers across the island in HDBs, army camps, newly constructed tentages, and etc.

The justifications provided by NGOs have always been on the basis of emotional appeals, regarding how migrant workers have came from far away to work on our infrastructures and other essential services, and they argue that in itself means they deserve better housing. So I ask: At what point is enough? Why is THIS extent not enough?

To be clear: The onus of responsibility is on them and everyone else who keeps making those claims. 

Again I'll say it: I appreciate the severity of the problem, but I don't see evidence for (1) why MORE resources should be given, and (2) to what extent are we supposed to help. Since you and so many others keep echoing that same claim even now, then provide your evidence and the rationale behind that.

You (and so many others like you) keep insisting that we are the ones who must come up with counter-arguments, even when this much resources are already committed across the nation. Why is the onus on us? Why are we not doing enough?

Since you argue that such social distancing measures are not enough, then are you going to be satisfied only when every single worker has their own individual housing in Singapore? I've already said that dorm operators that follow social distancing protocols can effectively maintain sufficient controls. Since you said these rules are not enough, then what should the ministry of health and manpower both change the rules to? Are you saying even army camps are not good enough, since there are 12-man and 16-man arrangements? By extension, are you saying the Ministry of Defence has not lived up to its duty and have neglected our conscripted citizens? Again, to what extent are you going to call for more resources? When are NGOs going to be satisfied? When are you going to be satisfied?

Again I'll say it: Improvements have been made in recent weeks to dorms. In this context, I've never referred to previous government approved dorms. Never.

It said the company has obtained planning permission from the URA in relation to the redevelopment project.Also, the Singapore Land Authority (SLA) would issue the company an offer to regularise the title restriction so as to reflect the approved use of the property as a worker dormitory, training centre and ancillary commercial use.SLA would also extend the use of the existing lease of Westlite Toh Guan by another 25 years from 2032 to 2057. The company said it understands from SLA that a development premium for the intensification of the property is not payable.Westlite Toh Guan dormitory was the first 2 foreign worker dormitories to be gazetted on 5 Apr as isolation areas under the Infectious Diseases Act, after a large surge in the numbers of infected workers were seen in the 2 dormitories.After its announcement on 14 Feb, Centurion Corporation gave a positive profit alert on 18 Feb to the public in relation to the good news it had received from URA and SLA earlier.It said that as the period of use for Westlite Toh Guan is extended by 25 years, the company would gain a fair value uplift on the investment property by S$70 million.
