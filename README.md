Capstone Project.

This project is currently ongoing. 

A model will be built to conduct sentiment analysis and topic modeling on forum posts regarding the government's handling of the COVID-19 outbreak in dorms.
Many people have expressed online their satisfaction or dissatisfaction towards how the government handled the situation. To find out the proportion of netizens who are supportive or against the government’s handling of the dorm outbreak, a model will be built to conduct sentiment analysis on online posts on the issue, to label the posts with a positive or negative sentiment. Topic modeling with then be conducted on posts from both classes to see investigate which topics are the most prevalent in the conversation surrounding this issue.

The guiding metric of the sentiment analyser (classification) model would be the accuracy score, f1-score and specificity score (minimise false positives). The baseline score would be the score if all predictions were of the majority class (either positive or negative sentiment). As for topic modeling, the success metric would be accuracy score.

Audience of project: Government agencies
This model could aid the government’s awareness of the conversation surrounding its response to the covid outbreak in dorms and help it suitably craft responses to address the peoples’ concerns regarding the issue. It can be used for other types of crises in the future, including economic and social issues.
