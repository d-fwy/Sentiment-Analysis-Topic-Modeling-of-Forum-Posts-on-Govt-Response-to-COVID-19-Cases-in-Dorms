"1. As of 23 April 2020, 12pm, the Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed and verified an additional 1,037 cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore. The breakdown is as follows:      a) Imported cases: 1      There are no imported cases today.      b) Cases in the community: 25 (22 Singaporeans/Permanent Residents1, 3 Work Passes)The number of new cases in the community has decreased, from an average of 34 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 25 per day in the past week. The number of unlinked cases in the community has decreased slightly, from an average of 20 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 18 per day in the past week. We will continue to closely monitor these numbers, as well as the cases detected through our surveillance programme.      c) Work Permit holders (residing outside dormitories): 30The number of new cases amongst Work Permit holders residing outside dormitories has continued to increase, from an average of 16 cases per day in the week before, to an average of 30 per day in the past week.       d) Work Permit holders (residing in dormitories): 982The main increase today continues to be for Work Permit holders residing in dormitories, where we are picking up many more cases because of extensive testing. Most of these cases have a mild illness and are being monitored in the community isolation facilities or general ward of our hospitals. None of them is in the intensive care unit.2. Details of these trends can be found in MOH’s daily situation Report (www.moh.gov.sg/covid-19/situation-report). Please refer to Annex A for the summary of the confirmed cases.3. Of the new cases, 75% are linked to known clusters, while the rest are pending contact tracing.Links between previous cases found4. In the past week (16 April to 22 April), MOH has uncovered links for 1,024 previously unlinked cases.5. Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases. Please refer to Annex B for details.Update on condition of confirmed cases6. 36 more cases2 of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 924 have fully recovered from the infection and have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities.7. As our care protocols adapt based on our understanding of the disease, we have re-categorised the confirmed cases to more accurately reflect where the confirmed cases are being cared for. There are currently 1,368 confirmed cases who are still in hospital. Of these, most are stable or improving, and 26 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. 8,874 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19. 12 have passed away from complications due to COVID-19 infection.8.

"Probably because foreign workers cannot vote and whatever impacts them doesn’t really resonate with what concerns the electorate (e.g. employment, housing, CPF, MRT etc)

I think the main party mentioning this is SDP, with CSJ regularly highlighting prior to the election about the  whole mask debacle and not locking down earlier. However, the angle he is taking is that these actions shows that the PAP is “inhumane” etc and doesn’t care about the health of citizens and are just greedy. (Up to you to decide whether that is a fair judgement)

Side note, opposition parties did use FW to attack the PAP in previous elections. In GE 2011, LTK brought up the issue of the government constructing a foreign worker dormitory near Serangoon Gardens, and how they did not listen to the concerns of residents and just went ahead to build it. Given that he won, that angle seems to resonate more with the electorate than the welfare of foreign workers.

That said, I can guarantee that there will be reforms with the FW dorms post elections. The government will have no choice but to issue new standards for dormitories and enforce them highly, given how the lax standards greatly affected the economy.",,2020-06-30 22:49:19,reddit,probably cannot vote whatever impacts doesn really resonate concerns electorate e g employment housing cpf mrt etc think main party mentioning sdp csj regularly highlighting prior election whole mask debacle not locking earlier however angle taking actions shows pap inhumane etc doesn care health citizens greedy decide whether fair judgement side note opposition parties use attack pap previous elections ge 2011 ltk brought issue government constructing near serangoon gardens not listen concerns residents went ahead build given won angle seems resonate electorate welfare said guarantee reforms post elections government no choice issue new standards enforce highly given lax standards greatly affected economy

"**TLDR: I disagree with most aspects of the arguments from the Critical Spectator poster (henceforth ""CS guy"") but I believe that this reasoning doesn't make him a racist.**

The word ""racist"" has been too frequently used as an end-all counterargument that it has lost its powerful original meaning. A racist is someone who deems his ethnicity to be superior to other ethnicities and acts based on this belief. A racist is an asshole by default, but the reverse is not necessarily true: you can be an inconsiderate, unsympathetic and uncompassionate idiot (like the CS guy) and **not** be a racist.

Reading the CS guy's post, I see that he opposes new dorm construction on economic and social grounds. These arguments are ridiculous. On the economic reason - I don't see any statistically significant reduction in housing prices in areas with dense foreign worker population (Little India, Jalan Besar, Bencoolen). In fact, these are lively areas whose ethnic diversity serves as a magnet to local/international tourists and a driver of economic activities (restaurants, shops, etc). In addition, the CS guy peppered his post with various unfounded, sometimes asinine assumptions: that people anywhere hate living next to ""social housing"", that migrant men want to ""hook up with maid girlfriends"", that the dorms would take up spaces that otherwise would be used to make parks and pools, etc. These are all broad, untenable assumptions that show how little he knows about how these migrants work and behave.

But - and this is a big but - those arguments don't make him a racist. By simply calling him a racist without taking on his arguments directly you won't change his opinion; rather, he will simply see you as a virtue-signalling SJW and the discussion will ground to a halt. If we want to have a conversation with somebody like the CS guy and influence the public discourse, let's avoid loaded terms like ""racist"", ""xenophobic"", etc unless they are really called for.",,2020-06-06 19:58:34,reddit,tldr disagree aspects arguments critical spectator poster henceforth cs guy believe reasoning doesn make racist word racist frequently used end counterargument lost powerful original meaning racist someone deems ethnicity superior ethnicities acts based belief racist asshole default reverse not necessarily true inconsiderate unsympathetic uncompassionate idiot like cs guy not racist reading cs guy post see opposes new construction economic social grounds arguments ridiculous economic reason see statistically significant reduction housing prices areas dense population little india jalan besar bencoolen fact lively areas whose ethnic diversity serves magnet local international tourists driver economic activities restaurants shops etc addition cs guy peppered post various unfounded sometimes asinine assumptions people anywhere hate living next social housing men want hook maid girlfriends would take spaces otherwise would used make parks pools etc broad untenable assumptions show little knows migrants work behave big arguments make racist simply calling racist without taking arguments directly won change opinion rather simply see virtue signalling sjw discussion ground halt want conversation somebody like cs guy influence public discourse let avoid loaded terms like racist xenophobic etc unless really called

For smaller dorms or smaller accommodation spaces, when outbreaks happen, you can manage it, you have quarantine. But when you have a much larger dorm, the requirements are quite different, the scale is very different. We need to weave this into the design of the dormitories themselves.

> Instead of just lowering the threshold, the more practical approach we believe is to add on additional requirements for dormitories above 1,000 beds. I emphasise again: existing regulations continue to be there. They continue to be important. They continue to cover a wide range of the concerns that we have today, and they will be looked at and will continue to be strengthened over time. But for the many PBDs that are going to come on line – the existing ones and the new ones – we do need these additional requirements because the scale of those dormitories is quite different.

Also noticed that the Joo Seng / Woodleigh area hasn’t been on the radar until recent years due to the new HDB estate developments, and given the near nature-reserve status of the Bidadari area as well, another point of contention would also be plans to conservation of nature while having plans for to improve the area in general which has ruffled the feathers of nature enthusiasts. More accessible facilities would be great, too, esp. since the CC is a good 20 mins walk away from me and it’s harder for us on this side to enjoy and access :(

"That's around the date when the number of positive cases that were Indian nationals starting shooting up, and more and more were formally linked to dorms/construction sites.

So after that I decided to save time by categorizing all adult male Indian nationals from then on to be dorm/construction-related. In March and earlier, there was still a decent chance that any Indian national could be an expat in some other industry. In April, sure, there could be a handful of Indian nationals that I mis-categorized, but there are vastly outnumbered by the dorm/construction workers.

"Foreign workers’ cramp living conditions very ideal for spread of COVID-19; So why no preparation for an outbreak?Activists such as Jolovan Wham have long criticised Singapore for the way it treats its foreign workers. It would probably be fair to say that they live in tight cramp quarters with low pay and no rights to citizenship even as they build the infrastructure in which we rely on.Even Professor Tommy Koh, Singapore’s Ambassador-at-Large commented that foreign workers are treated in a Third World manner.“…The government has allowed their employers to transport them in flat bed trucks with no seats. They stay in overcrowded dormitories and are packed likes sardines with 12 persons to a room. The dormitories are not clean or sanitary. The dormitories were like a time bomb waiting to explode. They have now exploded with many infected workers. Singapore should treat this as a wake up call to treat our indispensable foreign workers like a First World country should and not in the disgraceful way in which they are treated now..Given their housing arrangements, it comes as no surprise that the dreaded COVID-19 has reared its ugly head in these foreign worker dormitories.As of yesterday, 6 of the reported COVID-19 clusters are foreign workers dormitories and three that are construction sites.Bloomberg reports that:“Singapore reported its highest daily increase of coronavirus cases on Sunday, as infections rose among foreign workers housed in massive dormitories…….In particular, two previously reported clusters, involving dorms for foreign workers, saw a jump in the number of cases. These two dorms have now been declared “isolation areas” and any individuals residing there will have to stay in their rooms for 14 days to avoid the spread of the virus, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo. Almost 20,000 people live in the two dorms.”Countries the world over have asked its citizens to go into lock down in their own home to reduce the spread of the virus.But how are foreign workers who live so closely together in their dormitories ever to go into lock down or isolation properly? Even if they were to isolate themselves from the public, they still have to share their room with 10-20 other room mates.With people living so closely together, its conditions are pretty much ideal for the spread of the virus!Should Singapore not have done something earlier about this? It is after all not rocket science that the dormitories would be sitting ducks for the corona virus spread?Besides, cases having foreign workers being infected with COVID-19 are not new. There have been reports of the virus spreading in foreign workers’ accommodation as early as 10 February this year.Almost two whole months ago!Why didn’t the government act then? Why has the government not thought of measures to spread the foriegn workers out or find alternative housing in an event of a outbreak within a dormitory?Now, the workers in the two largest cluster of COVID-19 infection — S11 Dormitory @ Punggol (63 cases) and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory (28 cases) — are being isolated within the dormitories itself.This reeks of a potential repeat of the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship where the Japanese government is being accused of failing to isolate the crew of the Diamond Princess from the beginning of the quarantine, he said infected workers may have passed on “secondary or tertiary” infections to their fellow crew members and passengers, thereby exacerbating the deadly outbreak. At least 705 people contracted the virus during the quarantine, four of whom have died.Now word has it that the government is scrambling to refurnish housings to house these foreign workers for quarantine. But the government has had ample time to react but has seemingly done little or nothing? Why?Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo has said that the “key objective is to ensure the health and well-being of everyone, not just of our own people but also foreign workers helping our economy… We want to give foreign workers the assurance that the measures we take are in their interest as well as their well-being.”While the statement sends a strong feeling of intent, questions still remain as to whether this is a case of too little too late? If we genuinely cared about the welfare of our foreign workers, why wait till now to take action?We already know they live in close quarters. We already know that the virus tends to spread through close contact. Surely, it is a question of common sense to have done something about this earlier?Now that the virus has already begun to spread in the living quarters of the workers, it may well be too late to effectively stem the tide.Singapore prides itself as an efficient country. In view of this reputation of efficiency, it might be harder to believe that the government did not have an inkling that foreign workers would be susceptible to the outbreak and make preparation for it.",,2020-06-04 11:47:00,hardwarezone,cramp living conditions ideal spread no preparation outbreak activists jolovan wham long criticised singapore way treats would probably fair say live tight cramp quarters low pay no rights citizenship even build infrastructure rely even professor tommy koh singapore ambassador large commented treated third world manner government allowed employers transport flat bed trucks no seats stay overcrowded packed likes sardines 12 persons room not clean sanitary like time bomb waiting explode exploded many infected singapore should treat wake call treat indispensable like first world country should not disgraceful way treated given housing arrangements comes no surprise dreaded reared ugly head yesterday 6 reported clusters three construction sites bloomberg reports singapore reported highest daily increase sunday infections rose among housed massive particular two previously reported clusters involving saw jump number two declared isolation areas individuals residing stay rooms 14 days avoid spread said manpower minister josephine teo almost 20 000 people live two countries world asked citizens go lock home reduce spread live closely together ever go lock isolation properly even isolate public still share room 10 20 room mates people living closely together conditions pretty much ideal spread should singapore not done something earlier not rocket science would sitting ducks corona spread besides infected not new reports spreading accommodation early 10 february year almost two whole months ago didn government act government not thought measures spread foriegn find alternative housing event outbreak within two largest cluster infection s11 punggol 63 westlite toh guan 28 isolated within reeks potential repeat diamond princess cruise ship japanese government accused failing isolate crew diamond princess beginning quarantine said infected may passed secondary tertiary infections fellow crew members passengers thereby exacerbating deadly outbreak least 705 people contracted quarantine four died word government scrambling refurnish housings house quarantine government ample time react seemingly done little nothing minister manpower josephine teo said key objective ensure health well everyone not people also helping economy want give assurance measures take interest well well statement sends strong feeling intent questions still remain whether case little late genuinely cared welfare wait till take action already know live close quarters already know tends spread close contact surely question common sense done something earlier already begun spread living quarters may well late effectively stem tide singapore prides efficient country view reputation efficiency might harder believe government not inkling would susceptible outbreak make preparation

I have the same sentiments as you that we can improve their living conditions but I am against the fact that you are exaggerating their living conditions to seem like they live in horrible conditions which will misguide the public or those who are unaware. 

With regard to your second point, my opinion is that the current implementations are a necessary evil. The police are mainly there to enforce and make sure everyone stays put in the facility. With the sudden cluster outbreak and with covid at times having no symptoms, it's wise to contain the area and further prevent the spread. At least now we are able to identify suspects of covid, keeping them in place and dealing with them efficiently. It is a necessary evil because its the easiest way to contain the spread of the virus and prevent unlinked cases from increasing. 

With regard to not practicing social distancing, the workers are already in a facility where covid is apparent. The role of social distancing is to prevent further spread of the virus. In a way, the current measure is working because we are preventing the spread of covid to the outside world by containing the area. This move is similar to issuing a shn just that it's in a larger scale, affecting more people and enforced. With regards to multiple people being in the same room, the rooms are not as small as you think. The easiest way to describe would be that the size and layout of the room is similar to the bunks in tekong although they are smaller by a bit. Despite this there is also only a limited space in the dormitory, it's not feasible to move people around to maintain a super safe social distance. There's just no choice because in order to put social distancing in rooms into practice, the facility would have to move people out of rooms. Then the next issue would be where to move people without rooms? In my opinion the best solution now would be to have the facility management and the authorities to go through with workers why the place is under lock down and explain to them why the current measure is necessary. They should also gather all workers to address any concerns workers will have. This may quell any anger or resentment that occupants will have towards people in authority.",,2020-04-08 11:54:10,reddit,sentiments improve living conditions against fact exaggerating living conditions seem like live horrible conditions misguide public unaware regard second point opinion current implementations necessary evil police mainly enforce make sure everyone stays put facility sudden cluster outbreak times no symptoms wise contain area prevent spread least able identify suspects keeping place dealing efficiently necessary evil easiest way contain spread prevent unlinked increasing regard not practicing social distancing already facility apparent role social distancing prevent spread way current measure working preventing spread outside world containing area move similar issuing shn larger scale affecting people enforced regards multiple people room rooms not small think easiest way describe would size layout room similar bunks tekong although smaller bit despite also limited space not feasible move people around maintain super safe social distance no choice order put social distancing rooms practice facility would move people rooms next issue would move people without rooms opinion best solution would facility management authorities go place lock explain current measure necessary should also gather address concerns may quell anger resentment occupants towards people authority

"Ex-Deputy Prime Ministers Tharman and Teo Chee Hean brought in to handle manpower matters -deputy-prime...r-matters/After Senior Ministers Tharman Shanmugaratnam and Teo Chee Hean were roped in to handle manpower matters like the jobs council and the foreign worker dormitories situation, some Singaporeans are speculating whether Manpower Minister Josephine Teo was given too big a portfolio for her to cope with.Mr Tharman and Mr Teo served as Singapore’s Deputy Prime Ministers from 2011 to 2019. The pair stepped down from their posts and became Senior Ministers on 1 May 2019, following a Cabinet reshuffle that was designed to give fourth-generation (4G) ministers more exposure and responsibilities so that they can better support the next Prime Minister who will come from their cohort.The Cabinet reshuffle saw the ruling People’s Action Party’s (PAP) 4G cohort accept several promotions that resulted in them leading two-thirds of the Government’s ministries. Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat kept his ministry but also succeeded Mr Tharman and Mr Teo as Singapore’s sole Deputy Prime Minister, giving rise to speculation that he is the ruling party’s Prime Minister designate.Besides Mr Tharman and Mr Teo, fellow veteran politician Lim Swee Say stepped down from his post as Manpower Minister and was succeeded by Josephine Teo, who became Singapore’s second female minister to helm a ministry after Minister for Culture, Community and Youth Grace Fu.While Mr Tharman and Mr Teo seemed to take a backseat to allow the younger ministers to take charge, they have now taken on important responsibilities that pertain to manpower.Current DPM Heng Swee Keat tapped on Mr Tharman to chair the new National Jobs Council. Asserting that his predecessor has “both detailed knowledge and deep expertise in this issue” in his latest supplementary budget speech last month, Mr Heng revealed that the National Jobs Council will focus on creating jobs and helping workers build deep skills to stay employable in the challenging economy.Mr Teo was brought in to handle the foreign worker dormitories issue after COVID-19 outbreaks in the dorms ended up infecting over 33,567 workers and counting. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that Mr Teo is playing an advisory role in the Government’s inter agency task force to handle the situation in the dorms.The veteran politicians’ involvement in what are perceived as manpower matters has raised questions about the capabilities of Manpower Minister Josephine Teo.Mrs Teo was just recently under public scrutiny for the way she handled the COVID-19 outbreaks at the foreign worker dormitories. Some Singaporeans blamed the minister for allowing the COVID-19 situation to spiral out of control among migrant workers even though she was warned in advance that this might happen due to the workers’ overcrowded living conditions.When she was asked why she did not act early in implementing safe distancing measures in the dorms before the coronavirus infection spread uncontrolled, Mrs Teo did not apologise and instead blamed a lack of hindsight.Expressing a wish to “rewind the clock” to implement safe distancing measures in the dorms earlier, she told the local press: “If possible, I really wish to know at which stage the infection has already spread to community and migrant workers group?

"There are more than 40,000 Malaysians still in Singapore and the Malaysian state of Johor hopes that Singapore will make exemptions for them to be tested for Covid-19 before they are allowed to return to the state.More Malaysian workers are making their way back from Singapore after the Republic began implementing stricter measures to address the pandemic under a period known as the ""circuit breaker"". The measures which began on April 7 and will go on until May 4 have seen most workplaces and schools closed in order to reduce the risk of infections.Currently, Malaysians who test negative in Singapore will be able to go home and be quarantined there, while those without any certification or prior testing will be required to undergo compulsory 14-day quarantine at one of the government centres statewide.Johor Mentri Besar Hasni Mohammad said the state was working with the Malaysian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the matter with their counterpart in Singapore given that the city-state presently does not conduct Covid-19 tests unless a person has showed symptoms.Singapore's High Commissioner to Malaysia Vanu Gopala Menon previously said there was currently no requirement by the Singapore government to provide random Covid-19 tests for foreign workers while Singapore's Ministry of Health has said that Covid-19 testing is only performed when clinically indicated, for patients and their close contacts.""That means a Malaysian can't get the test done in Singapore unless they are symptomatic, "" Datuk Hasni said in an interview in the Johor district of Iskandar Puteri.""We hope Singapore will allow for some exemptions so that Malaysians who want to return can get this test done at its clinics or hospitals, "" he said.Hasni said he was confident that the matter would be discussed through the Malaysia-Singapore Special Working Committee on Covid-19 for a solution to be reached.He said since Malaysia implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) on March 18 to curb the coronavirus, it has resolved certain issues, including easing the movement of cargo, essential and non-essential items between both countries as well as accommodation for Malaysian workers in Singapore.""The government will not stop Malaysians returning from Singapore and I can assure them that our frontliners have taken all the necessary steps and procedures at our border, "" he said.Hasni urged returning Malaysians to give their full cooperation to the frontliners conducting the necessary screening and testing at the checkpoints.On the number of Malaysians returning from Singapore after the island republic started its own measures to curb the spread of the virus, Hasni said the biggest influx was registered on April 3 with some 3,400 people.

However, this is due to significant amounts of discrimination, systematic and otherwise, that their communities have faced for a long time. What you would want to do, as a society, is give a chance to those who overcome the stereotype - in other words, the black guy who, despite his poor upbringing, seems like a genuinely good person. Why use cultural stereotypes to judge someone instead of judging him or her based on their actions, their words, and their character?

I also agree that there's this unfortunate tendency to label someone as racist and leave it at that. I think this results in unnecessary polarisation and doesn't explore the bases of their beliefs and prejudices - hence not actually reducing racism, but driving it underground. This is probably a more significant problem in Singapore than it is in other countries because we actually have laws, vaguely written, which punish people who commit hate speech.",,2020-06-07 08:27:15,reddit,agree sense statistically speaking discrimination based ethnicity makes logical sense black community us example statistically higher crime rates poorer academic scores however due significant amounts discrimination systematic otherwise communities faced long time would want society give chance overcome stereotype words black guy despite poor upbringing seems like genuinely good person use cultural stereotypes judge someone instead judging based actions words character also agree unfortunate tendency label someone racist leave think results unnecessary polarisation doesn explore bases beliefs prejudices hence not actually reducing racism driving underground probably significant problem singapore countries actually laws vaguely written punish people commit hate speech

"I made this graph for those who have been trying to grapple with estimating the risk to the general public vs foreign worker dorms and construction sites.

Please note that lately, when MOH announces cases at night, the count includes cases confirmed that day as well as ""overflow"" from the day before. Therefore, the numbers in this chart don't tally with the announced numbers, and the data for 10-Apr are incomplete as more cases will be added on today.

The testing/reporting system may be under strain as of the cases announced last night, only 50+ were from yesterday and the rest were from the day before.

**Cases that aren't related to foreign worker dorms and constructions sites seem to be on a downward trend since 7/4/20**; hope it stays that way. It was only 51 cases and I included some China/Myanmar/Thai cases that could turn out to be dorm/construction-related but aren't formally linked yet.

I did this using the data at []() and ordering by local transmission and nationality. Classifying whether a case is likely linked to a foreign worker dorm or construction site is inexact. Basically all Bangladeshi adult males are assumed to be dorm-related; I also classified all Indian (nationality) males confirmed after Mar-31 to be dorm-related.

"> # Coronavirus: Conditions in dorms not main reason for clusters, says Tan Chuan-Jin

> The massive outbreak of coronavirus cases among migrant workers in dormitories cannot be attributed to bad living conditions alone, even if there are abysmal examples, said Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin yesterday.

> Rather, the highly contagious nature of the coronavirus and the fact that dorms involve groups of people living in close quarters are more likely to have contributed to the spread, said Mr Tan, who was Manpower Minister from 2014 to 2015.

> Speaking on the sidelines of an event for migrant worker dorms yesterday, Mr Tan said it was important not to conflate the two issues of bad living conditions and the Covid-19 pandemic, which he called a healthcare crisis of ""monumental proportions"".

> ""For example, in our universities, if the hostels remained open and the students were there, you would expect a massive outbreak to occur as well. If people are living in close quarters, given the contagious nature of this virus, outbreaks will occur,"" he said.

> Tackling questions regarding the outbreak in the dormitories, that as of yesterday has hit more than 18,000 cases, Mr Tan said it was not about ""white-washing"" cases of ""abysmal"" dorm conditions, but one should not generalise that all living conditions are as such.

> There were 741 new Covid-19 cases reported yesterday, bringing Singapore's total to 20,939.

> The living conditions of lower-paid foreign workers have been in the spotlight recently when dorms emerged as huge clusters where the coronavirus has spread. The outbreak highlighted the cramped and poorly maintained living spaces of some of these workers and their low-quality catered meals.

> On Monday, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo assured Parliament that the Government will see how housing standards for migrant workers can be further raised.

> Mr Tan said: ""It doesn't excuse (bad conditions), it is not acceptable and we need to take stringent action against those who violate the law - but it doesn't represent the whole space and that's the context that is important.

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> ""It is important to speak to the migrant workers as a whole for their lived experience to have a sense of the conditions. And given the scale and nature of this outbreak, we should not conflate the causes with these less-than-accurate generalisations.""

> When asked about the raising of dorm standards here, Mr Tan said there are things that can be improved on and the Government will be taking stock of the lessons learnt and the adjustments that need to be made.

> ""It is something that we will work on, but meanwhile, let's grapple with the (present) issues, look after our people and look after all the people who are here in Singapore who are affected in different ways,"" he said.

> During an online forum organised by the Institute of Policy Studies on Wednesday, analysts said a whole-of-society effort is needed to improve the wages and living conditions of foreign workers here.

> Not only must the Government take the lead in making structural changes, but Singaporeans, too, must change their us-versus-them mindset and take up collective responsibility, said the panellists.

"Didn't need proof, lol. It was inevitable. 

Society is a hot mess of discombobulating, incoherent and inconsistent ideas. And the bottom line is everyone has a voice, everyone is able to influence the outcome. It's simultaneously empowering and discouraging. 

Back in 2011, the influx of foreign labour was the, if not one of the largest, election issue. It cost the PAP a talented Foreign Minister (oh - and a GRC. Whatever). Since 2011 you can track a very clear and blunt shift in policy, focused on keeping FWs away from the public eye. The Little India Riots didn't help, and the public furor only cemented the policy turn as being the right thing to do (if only to avoid public outrage). 

Now, one can persist in laying that at the feet of the PAP, saying that's the PAP abdicating moral responsibility, etc. But another can also make the argument that the PAP was simply following their democratic mandate and listening to the people. *I find it very hard to accept any denial that the voters back in 2011 had a hand in creating the standard of living that FWs experience now*.  

Consequently, while I applauded the outpouring of goodwill to the FWs in the Covid saga, the inevitable pushback was inevitable. Because society is a hot mess. 

My response above was to the comment that we can simply ignore these people, that their views are inconsequential because they're ""wrong"". No. We can't. That's not how democracy works. They will have their voice. There will be an opposition party who will, under the temptation of quick and easy votes, champion their cause. And if none of the existing opposition parties are stupid enough to take up that flag, the likelihood of them creating their own opposition party to raise that voice only increases. 

It is inevitable. The only way we have forward is to continue to show that they are a misguided minority in our society, and their views do not hold water in dictating how the country decides to treat FWs.",,2020-06-02 15:17:48,reddit,didn need proof lol inevitable society hot mess discombobulating incoherent inconsistent ideas bottom line everyone voice everyone able influence outcome simultaneously empowering discouraging back 2011 influx labour not one largest election issue cost pap talented minister oh grc whatever since 2011 track clear blunt shift policy focused keeping fws away public eye little india riots didn help public furor cemented policy turn right thing avoid public outrage one persist laying feet pap saying pap abdicating moral responsibility etc another also make argument pap simply following democratic mandate listening people find hard accept denial voters back 2011 hand creating standard living fws experience consequently applauded outpouring goodwill fws saga inevitable pushback inevitable society hot mess response comment simply ignore people views inconsequential wrong no not democracy works voice opposition party temptation quick easy votes champion cause none existing opposition parties stupid enough take flag likelihood creating opposition party raise voice increases inevitable way forward continue show misguided minority society views not hold water dictating country decides treat fws

> Meals will be provided for the workers, as well as healthcare supplies including masks, thermometers and hand sanitiser, said the task force.

> Further safe distancing measures will also be implemented at all other worker dormitories, including staggering of meal times and minimising the inter-mingling of workers.

> However it should be made clear that foreign workers do not inherently have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19, said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong.

> ""It's not an issue of targeting a particular group, they are not of higher risk,"" said Mr Wong.

> ""The issue we have here is foreign worker dorms have now emerged as a cluster of infection, a new vector for transmission, despite the precautions we have taken.""

> Meanwhile the authorities are readying the Singapore Expo as a community care facility, according to Health Minister Gan Kim Yong.

> ""The Singapore Expo is being prepared as the next community care facility,"" he told reporters.

> These facilities are meant for housing patients who have more or less recovered but who could still be infectious, he added.

> Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had on Friday announced heightened safe distancing measures to act as a “circuit breaker” to curb the spread of COVID-19.

> Under the enhanced measures which will kick in next week, schools and workplaces – except those running essential services – will be closed for nearly a month until May 4. Food establishments will stay open only for takeaways or delivery.

> Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said on Sunday a third round of support measures will be rolled out to help businesses and households tide through these unprecedented “circuit breaker” measures.

> The “Solidarity Budget” will be announced when Parliament sits on Monday and comes less than two weeks after Mr Heng unveiled a record-breaking S$48 billion supplementary Budget.

"No. I’m talking about even preemptive actions. Like dorm workers should have been flagged as a high risk group when you have so many people living in such close quarters and so many of them going out the risk of outbreak within the dorm is massive.

"Thanks for your comments, they're very good points.

On OM, I see what you mean by the value in using it as a key indicator, but I would argue that CCL would also fall under the category of companies with low operating expenses. Comparing it to a similar asset class - the 3 largest Industrial REITs in Singapore, we see that CCL's OM is roughly in line with theirs, and indeed a little on the low side. Financing cost is also not included in OM.

**Operating Margin of Industrial REITs in Singapore (2017 - 2019)**

||**2019**|**2018**|**2017**|**Average**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Ascendas REIT**|73.30%|73.01%|73.56%|73.29%|
|**Mapletree Log REIT**|85.74%|84.48%|83.66%|84.62%|
|**Mapletree Ind REIT**|76.51%|76.43%|75.41%|76.12%|

This high OM seems to be mostly attributable to low depreciation costs. On depreciation, looking deeper CCL as a whole registered $3,113,000 (or 1.24% per annum) in depreciation expenses in 2019, of which only $607,000 (or 1.048% per annum) were attributable to their main assets, their buildings, on long-term property assets of $1,275,879,000 which seems a little low.

"First of all, no one knows what the labor cost component of building HDB flats is. MND has never revealed the cost of building flats in Singapore. 

Secondly, if you increase the pay for doing dirty work, employers will shift to more automation and technology. For example, the construction industry has been using more prefab technology in recent years. Hence, you may not see a proportionate increase in the labor component of building costs even if you double FW salaries. 

Thirdly, MOM collects a shitload of levy for foreign workers. Why can't this money be returned to the FWs in the form of higher pay? With higher pay, you can attract better skilled workers and improve productivity. Right now, foreign workers in the construction industry use Singapore as a stepping stone to better paying jobs in the middle east.

"-gue...igmcLuuodWKDsMQuote:This post is for those of you who somehow still don't understand how it is that China achieved getting the virus outbreak under control. There are no lies about it. There are no new cases and when a few crop up, the controls here are quickly put back in place. Our children are STILL not back to school even though there are no new cases. And this is even if President Trump wonders whether ""those numbers seem light"". I don't whether to laugh, cry or throw dishes at the wall.Here is exactly what we did and how we did it. (Living here for 21 years and having been here through the entire winter months up to now, I am extremely familiar with what has happened here on the ground along with thousands of other foreigners here as well, including our community through many of the chambers of commerce.) If you were also here in China during this time, then you fully understand this situation as well, please feel free to add anything I may have missed in the comments.1. The reason China does NOT have any new cases and got the virus completely under control in a few weeks is because even BEFORE any province had less than a hundred cases, the ENTIRE country was COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN. And EVERY person at all times outside wears a MASK. It is mandatory, not optional. What don't you understand about this crystal clear explanation?2. For example, here where we live in Liaoning province, we only had 89 cases and the ENTIRE province was shut down.3. ALL public transportation, EVERY retail shop, EVERY office building, EVERY school. EVERYTHING was ENTIRELY shutdown.4. The ONLY thing you could do was go to a nearby grocery store with temperature and QR scan controls to buy groceries. That's it. Every 3-4 days I went out to one of the two large markets that were open. On entering, they took your temperature and you scan the QR code to track where and when you were so they can back trace who you were in contact with later if you later developed symptoms.5. After shopping, then go back home and enjoy your self isolated. With your children at home because the schools were shut. It has been a struggle to keep Vincent busy in a routine, moving him from playtime to online courses to reading to playing downstairs. But we're doing great.6. THIS is what WE did for weeks. More importantly, THIS is what EVERY province across the ENTIRE country WITHOUT exception DID. This was provinces with very few cases.7. We didn't WAIT. The govt said do it, we did it. Its called civic duty and sacrifice to your community in the society in which you live.8. By end of February, most provinces had no new cases. All controls remain in place, now relaxed. If and when any small clusters of new cases pop up, those controls will instantly be turned ON again. So there will never be another large outbreak ever again anywhere in China.9. Updated here: As of now, all cities have rolled out the ""Green Health QR Code APP across China's cities. Every Chinese citizen has it on their mobile devices. Here in Shenyang, for example, you need to QR scan show your green health code when you enter the subway, or a mall. Simple. If for some reason, it is yellow you can 't go and if it is red, you belong at home in quarantine. The software works for foreigners in most cities. Here in Shenyang, it is not updated yet. So foreigners need to show their passport and register in a manual book in that case. (UPDATE the version that works for foreigners in Shenyang is now available) Perfect? Nope, definitely not. Annoying at times? Sure. But its a system in action being rolled out and tweaked at lightning speed across the country. Privacy? Hah, don't make me laugh. You better get over that one anywhere on planet earth.So now I want to ask you. DO YOU HAVE ANY MORE SILLY QUESTIONS ABOUT WHY THERE ARE NO CASES HERE IN CHINA?Or do you still believe the latest CIA ""Intelligence"" report and other media on how things are still bad in China, which by the way are just trying to make you feel better about how bad things are there instead?And another point regarding all the cremation urns in Wuhan. This is because ALL people who had died from January 1st onward were never released during the outbreak lockdown period because, as I told you all businesses were shut down, which would include ceremony/cemetery services for urns. So it was a backlog of the normal # of people who die which is also thousands plus the virus patients who died.And on the millions of cell phones cancelled, that's because all the workers on very low salaries/income at home for 3 months cancelled their mobile subs to save money while they knew they were stuck at home for at least two months.Are you done speculating? I surely hope so.Thanks, God Bless, Go Home and Stay Home until the end of May and don't touch ANYTHING outside your home, Use sanitizer and wipes. Don't get near ANY PERSON whose history you don't know. Tough. Simple. Do It. I told you before, act like you're going camping for a few weeks.

"In a Facebook post on Apr. 13, co-chair of the Multi-Ministry TaskForce for Covid-19 Lawrence Wong gave an update on the Covid-19 situation in Singapore.Wong shared three charts detailing the three types of infected cases in Singapore:Imported casesCommunity casesWork permit and dormitory casesThe charts document the number of cases in each category up to Apr. 11.Wong mentioned that the number of community cases increased with the wave of imported cases, but the numbers have seen ""some moderation in recent days"".Wong attributes this to the safe distancing measures that have been put in place.However, he noted that the number of cases related to work permit holders and dormitories have increased sharply, and will likely continue to do so as Singapore undertakes ""more aggressive testing"" of workers staying in the dormitories.He reiterated that Singapore has a ""comprehensive strategy"" to take care of foreign workers in the dormitories, and assured the public that the government is ""going all out to tackle this"" though it will take some time for the effects of the circuit-breaker measures to show.""We will only see the full effects of the circuit breaker in the next one to two weeks.

Dormitory owners(not company owners) charge exorbitant rates to the companies that rent from them. A good first step is probably looking into those rates, and compare the rental price to the living conditions there.
