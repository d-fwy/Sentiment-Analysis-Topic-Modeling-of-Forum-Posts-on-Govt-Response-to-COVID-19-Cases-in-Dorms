However, NSFs and NSmen are probably better educated with regards to hygiene practices and precautions to be taken against the virus, and are also likely to be less clustered in general.

Hence the danger and potential for a cluster to form in camps. Also, i'm sure stand by bunks are being conducted more rigourously now but still...i wouldn't exactly trust the standards of a typical NSF haha.

">The problem is that theres uncertainties but govt is doing nothing to  help manage them while they're the ones causing it. Like when will this  cb end? When they said one month,  i think a lot of people were willing  to tahan and accept it, even those retailers. One month isnt that bad.  Then it became 2 while most of the cases werent in community but migrant  dorms. Then its 3. When community cases were 4 on average per day. If  we can't even open up at that number,  how can we be certain we will  ever hit phase 2 when phase 1 will definitely cause community cases to  go up?

To be fair, the whole situation is so fluid that no one can know what will happen. To say the government is not trying to help the retailers is also BS. The JSS scheme, rental waivers those are things that the government is trying to help businesses.

That said, there will be some business that will go bust because they were already tethering on the edge. As much as we would like to save all business, there is no way the government can do it.

"1) Literally difference in belief once again. Like I said, I don't believe in capitalism. Negative externalities will never be covered by the market, are you insane? How much compromised rivers and seas polluted by waste and natural water resources occupied by private enterprise do you need before you realize government intervention is needed to mitigate that shit?

2) Sure you can be critical, the hell are you on about. I didn't try to censure you or attack your freedom of speech. I can simply attempt to shoot down your criticism if it's a stupid criticism. I think your proposal that tech would magically solve the problem is unrealistic, and I think your proposal that simply putting in regulation is stupid. 

Your entire argument boils down to this: prodding the market will fix it.

You are underestimating the shithole the market is.

3) Again I think you're being dumb. You back yourself into a corner if you criticise coal but provide zero alternatives. What do you do when asked so what? You just tell them to have the market find alternative for you. Meanwhile the market is doing everything in their power to fund the notion that coal is a necessary evil through fudged bias studies, and that coal isn't that bad. 

That is not true. It's because of extremely convincing proposals that alternatives are viable and the cost will be lowered that countries adopted a different policy.

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Monday (13 April) confirmed a record daily rise of 386 new COVID-19 cases, bringing the total to 2,918 here.

> On Sunday, 32 more patients have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, bringing the total of recovered patients to 560.

> Most of the 976 hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while 31 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit. A total of 988 cases who are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19 are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Eight have died from complications due to COVID-19 infection, including a 90-year-old Singaporean man who succumbed to the disease on Saturday.

> At least 17 clusters linked to foreign worker dormitories have been identified thus far, including the largest cluster at S11 Dormitory@Punggol, which is linked to 365 cases.

> Eight such dorms have been gazetted as isolation areas, including the newly confirmed cluster at Acacia Lodge and Cochrane Lodge II.

> As of Sunday noon, the MOH has identified 28,140 close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 12,088 are currently quarantined, and 16,052 have completed their quarantine.

> As of 7 April noon, 72,680 swab tests have been carried out, of which 47,486 of them involved unique individuals. 

> The COVID-19 Temporary Measures Act, passed in Parliament on Tuesday, gives authorities the power to ban events and gatherings, or impose conditions on how they are conducted, during the “circuit breaker” period lasting till 4 May.

> Those caught flouting these regulations will be fined $300 and subsequently face prosecution for repeated offences.

> Under the Act, the penalty for first-time offenders is up to a $10,000 fine, a jail term of up to six months, or both. For second-time or subsequent offenders, the penalty is a fine of up to $20,000 along with a possible jail term of up to a year.

> People who flout their five-day medical leave or stay-home notices and do not wear masks if they have to leave their place of accommodation to seek emergency medical treatment are also subjected to similar penalties.

> Part of the “circuit breaker” measures – announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last Friday – include the closure of schools and most workplaces. Only essential services like food establishments, markets and supermarkets, transport, and key banking services will remain open during the month-long closure.

> In a Good Friday address, Lee reiterated his call for Singaporeans to stay home, as COVID-19 cases continue to rise in foreign worker dormitories as well as in the general population.

> Over the weekend, the authorities issued a slew of measures, including the closure of beaches, facilities in parks and gardens and playfields.

> Wearing masks was also made compulsory for commuters on public transport, as well as while those visiting supermarkets, convenience stores, pharmacies, and shopping malls.

> Stadiums have also been closed, while parents are not allowed to drop off their children with grandparents on a daily basis.

> To date, there are over 1.8 million COVID-19 cases globally. More than 115,000 have died from the virus, with the US holding the record for the highest global death toll at over 22,000.

> At over half a million cases, the country also holds the record of having the largest number of patients globally, followed by Spain at over 169,000 cases, Italy at over 156,000, followed by France at over 132,000.

> China, where the virus originated, has over 82,000 cases and earlier last Tuesday reported no new coronavirus deaths for the first time since it started publishing figures in January.

"Invisible hand of the market. 

The only things that I think government should directly intervene in are inelastic goods.

For Singapore, I refer to housing/medicine/food/water as inelastic. 

For the rest, the government should still regulate them but allow the market to run its course. If the regulations result in higher manpower costs, these costs will be transferred eventually onto the end consumer who consumes this product. 

For instance, if FW regulation leads to increase in manpower cost which leads to renovation becoming more expensive, then the end customers who want to use these FW for renovation will just have to pay more. 

I am not the one consuming a product based on the labour of these FWs.

"The cleanliness and sanitation at four of the foreign worker dormitories that have been gazetted as isolation areas has vastly improved, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Friday (Apr 10). In a media release, MOM said enhanced measures and cleaning routines had been put in place at the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, Westlite Toh Guan Dormitory, Toh Guan Dormitory and Sungei Tengah Lodge.At these isolation areas, workers are quarantined in their rooms for a two-week period as part of efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19. They also receive onsite medical support and enhanced health screening.COVID-19 infections have spiked in foreign worker dormitories recently, with cases linked to 10 such dormitories across the island. Out of Singapore's 2,108 COVID-19 cases, more than 500 cases are linked to dormitories.Photos and videos circulating on social media earlier this week appeared to show crowded and unsanitary conditions at the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol -  currently the largest coronavirus cluster in Singapore, with 306 cases. MOM said it had instituted enhanced waste management and sanitation regimes at the four isolation areas. The frequency of refuse collection and removal from the premises for disposal have been increased from once a day to three to five times daily, depending on the premises, said the ministry. It noted that disinfection and cleaning of common areas and washroom facilities are also being carried out an average of thrice a day at the four isolation areas. These measures will also be introduced at the Tampines Dormitory - where are there currently 49 COVID-19 cases - which was also gazetted as the fifth such isolation area on Friday. MOM also noted that dormitory operators had been working with external vendors as well as in-house cleaners to improve the cleanliness and sanitation in the dorms. The measures taken include increasing the rounds of cleaning at the dormitories up to five times a day and getting additional to clean frequently used areas such as toilets and corridors. External vendors have also been engaged to clear rubbish at the isolation areas, as well as increasing the frequency of disinfecting from twice to four times daily.  MOM officers have been working round the clock at the dormitories gazetted as isolation areas to ensure the foreign workers well-being is taken care of and the living conditions are of the highest standards, said the ministry. It added it would act on feedback provided by dormitory residents to determine possible areas of improvements. In a video posted on his Facebook page on Friday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Singapore was paying close attention to the welfare of foreign workers, amid the COVID-19 outbreak. ""They came to Singapore to work hard for a living, and provide for their families back home ...

"There are a lot of places [where work permit holders can live](-and-permits/work-permit-for-foreign-worker/housing/various-types-of-housing). Some we don't normally think of, such as ""construction temporary quarters"" and ""temporary occupation license"". Only Malaysians and work permit holders in the services and manufacturing sectors are allowed to live in HDBs. Construction workers are not. The services and manufacturing work permit holders can only come from Malaysia, China, HK, Macau, South Korea, and Taiwan.

The vast majority of Singapore's cases are the intersection of three groups: construction workers, dorm-residents, and (unfortunately) Bangladeshi and Indian foreign workers. Most cases fall in all 3 groups; it's like a Venn diagram of 3 circles that mostly overlap. But there are, for example, PRC and Myanmarese construction workers who are dorm-residents who got it. 

Common sense suggests that most of these non-dorm WP holders are either construction workers (got it from colleagues) or Bangladeshi/Indian foreign workers (got it from friends), rather than completely new clusters of HDB-renters, as most people are imagining.

The MOH report on the 30th, when there were quite a lot of non-dorm WP cases, notes ""**The vast majority of these cases are workers in the construction sector serving their Stay-Home Notice (SHN) requirements**.""

 One such non-dorm WP cluster is [234 Balestier Road](-19-update-april-15-4-clusters/) (shophouses).

"Why the PAP has failed14 Feb - there was a foreign worker tested positive for COVID-19 and he was rushed into ICU a day later. 17 Feb - 2 more foreign workers were tested positive for the virus. 18 Feb - it was revealed that they formed a new cluster from a work site.News came out and employers rushed to send their foreign workers, who are unwell, to the hospital for a swab test.19 Feb - MOM published a news article from Mr Kelvin Teoh (divisional director of MOM for foreign workers) that employers must not send the foreign workers to the hospital or they may have their WORK PASS privileges suspended. Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet. The poor foreign workers in numbers of 300,000 became victims of the PAP government, due to their lack of hindsight and that huge stench of arrogance to listen to the public when many threads about the issue was raised in and around mid Feb.

"What most people fail to realise is that construction is actually an extremely low margin business. Average profit margins for large construction firms are 1.5-2% globally. Dorm operators enjoy considerably higher margins but they are often squeezed heavily by the main construction firms due to the aforementioned thin margins. 

In such a thin margin business, price increases are almost always passed on to the consumer. The competition in this industry is also nowhere near as intense as some of other large regulated industries (e.g. banks); and this further diminishes the bargaining power of consumers vis a vis companies.

Finally, as much as people demand better conditions for workers, most of us fail to put our money where our mouth is. Think of the sweatshop scandals from big firms like Apple, H&M, Nike etc. For all the feel-good ""demands"" for better worker conditions - people continue to purchase these companies' goods despite their perpetuation of these practices.

"> # COVID-19: Singapore confirms 611 new cases, total at 33,860

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 611 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Friday (29 May) noon, bringing the total to 33,860.

> Of them, the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories, said the ministry, while three others are Singaporeans or permanent residents.

> It added that more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> This story will be updated later.

> MOH’S STATEMENT IN FULL

> From Monday, the MOH will publish a list of locations visited by cases in the community for over 30 minutes. This list – which excludes residences, workplaces, healthcare facilities, and public transport – will be updated on a rolling 14-days basis or one incubation period, the ministry said.

> As a precautionary measure, the MOH advised those who had been at these locations during the specified timings to monitor their health closely for 14 days from their date of visit.

> They have also been urged by the ministry to visit the doctor if they develop symptoms such as cough, sore throat, as well as fever and loss of taste or smell, and inform the doctor of their exposure history.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of over 2,600 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tuas View Dormitory and Jurong Penjuru Dormitory.

> The four are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some 400,000 foreign workers live in dorms here in Singapore.

> Some 20,000 infected foreign workers are expected to be discharged by the end of this month, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong at a press conference on 12 May.

> With 1,018 more cases of COVID-19 infection discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, a total of 18,294 cases – more than half of the total infections here – here have fully recovered from the infection, said the MOH on Thursday.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while seven are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Apart from 23 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, nine others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and two whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> It had also noted that 86 male foreign workers aged 25 to 59 died due to heart disease in Singapore in 2018.

> As of 25 May, the ministry has conducted 334,691 swab tests, of which 218,996 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 58,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 38,400 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

"I'm not sure how I'm insinuating it's a problem of race or nationality. It is a fact that the vast majority of people living in dorms where outbreaks are happening happen to be foreign workers, hence my use of the term ""foreign worker dorms"".

My core claim remains unrefuted- that the dorm problem, by virtue of being the covid problem, affects Singaporeans, and hence is deserving of our tax money. If the situation calls for more money and attention, it should get it if it helps the dorm problem. I don't think I need to provide a full breakdown of where funds should go to make that point understandable. If my failure to do so makes you think this point is invalid, then I concede that it is invalid.

If you are of the belief that dorms which satisfy social distancing protocol are akin to those living in HDB in terms of covid risk, I don't know what to tell you. Look at pictures of foreign dorms - even the government-approved ones - they are nowhere near HDB level of distancing. I am not saying all dorm Operators are flouting the rules: I am saying following the rules still make them the most prone.

"Less revenue is your excuse to have people standing close in MRT? What’s the point of social distancing outside when running if you are going to have people cramped up in a train? That defeats the purpose. 

I am very concerned about the spread of virus. You seem to think because a place has been disinfected it can’t be infected again. I have news for you, any infected person touches the surface again when your disinfectant evaporates, can contaminate it! 

Buses and trains are ripe for it. Clusters get disinfected. Not every place an infected person has been. You can’t even trace every person you came into contact with, let alone every surface. Even in one city! You either think reality is a video game or we live in 2045. 

People are supposed to go out with masks. Most are, some are not. And wearing masks doesn’t mean you don’t touch surfaces or items in a supermarket. You don’t need to breathe in the virus. Touch is enough. Bring yourself up to speed.

By focusing on narratives to state foreign cases (all infected locally) are the problem because local cases are declining, the government is setting a bad expectation. One you have bought and refuse to budge from. You are entitled to believe what you want and see things your way. As I am. 

If you are unwilling to see obvious undertones in labeling workers staying in dorms as foreign cases separates from “local cases” whatever that means, you are part of the problem for me. So please suit yourself.

FWs would rarely speak up about this because they’re often banned from contacting NGOs for help, and may not even know about their rights or dare to fight back for fear of being sent home. Even if they win a case, the employer could simply shut down the company and empty the funds so that the worker gets paid no compensation. 

This is on top of all the pay transparency issues within the industry (no time logs, no breakdowns of their pay, being give significantly less than what they were initially offered, not even being paid sometimes and when owed too much money the employer just pack and leave).

"> # COVID-19: All foreign worker dormitories to be 'effectively' in lockdown - Josephine Teo

> SINGAPORE — All 43 purpose-built foreign workers dormitories here will soon be “effectively” on lockdown, affecting some 200,000 workers.

> During a virtual press conference led by the COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce on Tuesday (14 April), Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said that the authorities aim to apply the same safe distancing measures implemented in isolation areas to the remaining dorms.

> Thus far, eight dorms have been gazetted as isolation areas, with the latest being Cochrane Lodge II.

> “While these (other) dorms are not presented as isolation areas, we aim to apply the same safe distancing measures so that they are effectively also on lockdown,” said Teo.

> Some 7,000 healthy workers who are providing essential services have already been moved out of the dormitories.

> They would be placed at various activated sites such as SAF military camps, the Changi Exhibition Centre, floating hotels, or floatels, that are typically used for offshore accommodation, as well as vacant Housing Board blocks in Tanjong Pagar and Jurong.

> About 1,300 healthy workers will be progressively relocated in batches to three floating hotels berthed at Tanjong Pagar Terminal over the next few weeks. The first batch of 31 healthy workers have been moved to a floatel.

> At least 19 clusters linked to foreign worker dormitories have been identified as of Monday night, including the largest cluster of 586 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol.

> Those linked to S11 account for nearly half of the total 1,193 cases linked to clusters at foreign worker dorms and construction sites.

> On Tuesday, the Ministry of Health’s director of medical services Kenneth Mak said there were another 334 new cases of COVID-19 infection in Singapore, taking the total to 3,252.

"Minister for Manpower Josephine Teo on Tuesday (Apr 14) thanked foreign workers for their hard work in Singapore and their cooperation as the country fights to curb the spread of the COVID-19 outbreak.In a video, Mrs Teo extended her Tamil New Year greetings to foreign workers in Singapore, wishing them good health.""Today is the start of the new year for you, but it is difficult to celebrate without family and friends,"" said Mrs Teo in the video.""The COVID-19 outbreak has affected all of us, but I know it is especially hard for you. I want to thank you for all your hard work in Singapore and for your cooperation during this period.""On behalf of all Singaporeans, I wish you good health in the new year. Stay safe for your families, stay safe for your friends,"" she said.Ministry of Communications and Information of Mr Iswaran, who also appeared in the video, also paid tribute to foreign workers for their contribution to Singapores development and growth.Amid COVID-19, Mr Iswaran said he understood the foreign workers concerns about their wages and that is why the government is working with their employers to ensure that they will continue to be paid in this period.We are also making arrangements to ensure that you get the necessary healthcare and also the services for food and for your accommodation, and also for the larger needs in terms of IT and Wi-Fi connectivity so that you can stay connected to your families, he added.Singapore has put in place strict safe distancing measures during what it calls a circuit breaker period to stem the spread of COVID-19. The measures - which include shutting down non-essential workplaces and schools - will be in place for one month until May 4.A large number of Singapore's recent COVID-19 cases have been from foreign worker dormitories.Several dormitories have been declared as isolation areas, meaning residents have to be quarantined in their rooms.Concerns have been raised about the welfare of foreign workers in dormitories, and the ability of dorm operators to implement COVID-19 safe distancing measures, with photos and videos circulating online of crowded and unsanitary conditions.The Ministry of Manpower has since stepped in to help manage the situation - saying it has ensured better distribution and quality of meals, as well as improved waste management and hygiene conditions.Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said on Sunday that the Government has short-term and long-term plans in place to improve conditions at foreign worker dormitories.In the immediate term, the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force has set up a special group to look at the measures needed for foreign worker dormitories, said Mr Heng.This includes raising standards of cleanliness and hygiene and reducing the concentration of foreign workers in the dormitories, said Mr Heng, adding that authorities are looking into housing foreign workers in other facilities.Mr Iswaran said on Tuesday that the implementation of circuit breaker measures to contain the spread of COVID-19 had imposed much inconvenience and challenges for all, but that it was important for everyone to work together.It is important that all of us whether we are citizens, permanent residents, or workers from overseas like you, that we all come together and do our part so that we can overcome this challenge, he said.He wished them a Happy New Year, Happy Vishu and Happy Vaisakhi.-12638796",,2020-04-14 11:28:00,hardwarezone,minister manpower josephine teo tuesday apr 14 thanked hard work singapore cooperation country fights curb spread outbreak video mrs teo extended tamil new year greetings singapore wishing good health today start new year difficult celebrate without family friends said mrs teo video outbreak affected us know especially hard want thank hard work singapore cooperation period behalf singaporeans wish good health new year stay safe families stay safe friends said ministry communications information mr iswaran also appeared video also paid tribute contribution singapore development growth amid mr iswaran said understood concerns wages government working employers ensure continue paid period also making arrangements ensure get necessary healthcare also services food accommodation also larger needs terms wi fi connectivity stay connected families added singapore put place strict safe distancing measures calls circuit breaker period stem spread measures include shutting non essential workplaces schools place one month may 4 large number singapore recent several declared isolation areas meaning residents quarantined rooms concerns raised welfare ability operators implement safe distancing measures photos videos circulating online crowded unsanitary conditions ministry manpower since stepped help manage situation saying ensured better distribution quality meals well improved waste management hygiene conditions deputy prime minister heng swee keat said sunday government short term long term plans place improve conditions immediate term multi ministry task force set special group look measures needed said mr heng includes raising standards cleanliness hygiene reducing concentration said mr heng adding authorities looking housing facilities mr iswaran said tuesday implementation circuit breaker measures contain spread imposed much inconvenience challenges important everyone work together important us whether citizens permanent residents overseas like come together part overcome challenge said wished happy new year happy vishu happy vaisakhi 12638796

"Mustafa staff got infected. Whether they got infected by Singaporeans or tourists or dorm workers, we don't know. But it's quite possible that Mustafa staff were the intermediary that transmitted from local or imported cases, to the worker dorms.

We don't actually know that ""a few Bangladeshi/Indian workers already got the virus in February and started spreading it"".

"Oh alright, I kinda get what you mean.

His point here is to use your basic instincts to figure out the validity (ie someone making sense) of each arguments presented, not really about the legality. 

For example, the point he mentioned was 'if the dorms were better (of the conditions) the situation be better'. In this case, to evaluate if the argument is valid, draw on your own experiences, instincts to see if the situation is dependent on living conditions.

If you have lived in a clean environment but still got sick easily (or lived in a dirty environment but never got sick much) then your basis is that the covid situation in dorms is not necessarily dependent on living conditions.

If you have lived in a clean environment and never got sick much and then lived in a dirty environment and got sick frequently, pr vice versa, then your basis is that the covid situation in dorms is very likely linked to living conditions.

These examples and analysis show that basic instincts may not encroach into the issues of legality. 

Basic instincts don't always have to mean a right or wrong, but more on what makes more sense to the person thinking. It can be right from Person A's POV, but wrong from Person B's POV.

"I live nearby. I mentioned it in one of my previous post a few days ago. 

Honestly, I’m glad they’re doing this because we know that special times call for special needs. We also know that these blocks were going to be torn down and were kind of sad cos they’re an icon of the neighbourhood but efforts to save them went unheard. So it’s kind of nice that these blocks can have a final lease of life before they’re gone. 

As a nearby resident, my worry was that if they bring the virus over from the dorms, it’s too close to home. At the very least there needs to be a proper barrier from the residential communities (I know, this sounds like putting them in jail but hear me out). These blocks are right next to elderly rental flats, home of the most vulnerable group of people in this COVID crisis. It’s also right next to Redhill market, where many elderly come from other neighborhoods even to do their daily grocery shopping. It’s also literally 3 minutes away from the MRT station. My worry is that if they don’t follow the rules of lockdown, spreading the virus around the neighbourhood would have dire consequences given the average aged population here. 

Which is why I’m glad to see that the authorities have set up a barricade around the blocks so that the entry and exit points are limited and more importantly, controlled. It’s not ideal but it’s a compromise I think we all have to accept in special times like these. From what I understand, They are still able to come out of the residences to make essential purchases so they are not say utter lack of freedom like a convict. They have to follow lockdown rules like the rest of us so we are as much a convict in our own homes as they are.

So ya, to address some of your concerns (specifically the downvotes guy who talked about property prices and deleted his comment while I was typing reply to him so I’m reposting this as a parent comment instead), most residents here are understanding enough to know whats going on and we applaud this measure taken. We know it’s only short term, and we care less about property prices and more about the virus spreading as new elements are introduced in the neighbourhood and we don’t know for sure how things will play out. 

Ps: they’ve been working on this for weeks now, so please do give the govt some credit here. They did not as some have claimed, do nothing for the dorm workers, but instead have been working quietly in the background until things are up and and running before they announce it. I can assure you first hand based on the massive effort and how long they took to refit the place, that **they’ve been working on this waaaaayyy before the recent clusters at the dorms broke out (less the initial cluster at S11 at Seletar).** In fact, they’ve only moved in two days ago to the first few flats which are ready, they’re still working on the other blocks in the precinct at this very moment.

"-highligh...er-dormitories5TH APR 2020    The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) had issued advisories on enhanced precautionary measures in dormitories to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission. However transmissions within foreign worker dormitories have continued to rise and we are seeing more confirmed cases and workers who are ill. The S11 Dormitory @ Punggol (2 Seletar North Link) and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory (18 Toh Guan Road East) are of particular concern.2.    The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has decided that further measures are necessary to contain the risk of further transmission among the foreign workers within these two dormitories. This would keep the workers safe, as well as protect the wider community from widespread transmission from these clusters. Both S11 Dormitory @ Punggol and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory have been declared as isolation areas. Onsite medical support has been deployed, along with provision of food and essential supplies.Measures to contain further outbreak3.    The S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, with 13,000 resident workers, and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory, with 6,800 resident workers, have been gazetted as isolation areas. Given the rising number of confirmed cases, this is necessary to avoid the risk of further transmissions from any potentially infected workers to others in the dormitories, as well as into the community. Workers who are symptomatic have already been isolated.4.    Within these two dormitories, precautionary steps have also been taken to protect workers who are well. All the affected workers will not go to work. Access to recreational facilities will be regulated to reduce the inter-mixing of workers. Movement between blocks is prohibited. Workers have also been advised to cease social interactions with others who do not reside in the same room or floor.5.    MOM is working closely with all dormitory operators, to implement similar measures within their premises with immediate effect. Efforts are also underway in the larger dormitories to reduce the density of their resident workers, by transferring some among them to alternative accommodation during this period.Support provided to workers6.    The workers will continue to be paid their salaries for the duration of the quarantine. Their period of absence from work is treated as paid hospitalisation leave as part of the workers leave eligibility under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA). Their employers are eligible to claim for the $100 daily quarantine allowance.7.    Arrangements will be made to cater three meals a day for all affected workers for the duration of the quarantine. They will also be issued with reusable masks, surgical masks, thermometers, hand sanitisers and other essentials so they can keep themselves safe and comfortable.8.    Onsite medical support has been deployed to support the workers residing at both dormitories. The dormitories have also implemented enhanced health screening measures, such as requiring workers to check and report their temperature twice daily, as well as the regular monitoring for fever and respiratory symptoms. Those who are unwell will be isolated and will be assessed by medical personnel for further attention. Support provided to companies with affected workers9.    Companies that are providing essential services with workers affected by this quarantine order will be supported and arrangements will be made to ensure these essential services can continue to be provided.Advisory to dormitory operators10.   Dormitory operators and workers living in dormitories are reminded of the importance of maintaining high standards of hygiene and cleanliness to safeguard their own health and those of others who are living in the same space. Safe distancing measures must be strictly adhered to. These include measures such as no inter-mixing of workers between dormitory blocks and floors, and for workers to stay within their rooms and to minimise interactions.11.   Social responsibility is critical in slowing the transmission of the virus. We need every individual to play their part in the fight against the virus. Those who are unwell, even with mild flu-like symptoms, should not be at work. They must see a doctor immediately to prevent spreading illness to others.MINISTRY OF HEALTH & MINISTRY OF MANPOWER5 APRIL 2020wow.. 100 per day? do the employers even pay the workers that much?",,2020-05-04 19:53:00,hardwarezone,highligh er dormitories5th apr 2020 ministry manpower mom issued advisories enhanced precautionary measures minimise risk transmission however transmissions within continued rise seeing confirmed ill s11 punggol 2 seletar north link westlite toh guan 18 toh guan road east particular concern 2 multi ministry taskforce decided measures necessary contain risk transmission among within two would keep safe well protect wider community widespread transmission clusters s11 punggol westlite toh guan declared isolation areas onsite medical support deployed along provision food essential supplies measures contain outbreak3 s11 punggol 13 000 resident westlite toh guan 6 800 resident gazetted isolation areas given rising number confirmed necessary avoid risk transmissions potentially infected others well community symptomatic already isolated 4 within two precautionary steps also taken protect well affected not go work access recreational facilities regulated reduce inter mixing movement blocks prohibited also advised cease social interactions others not reside room floor 5 mom working closely operators implement similar measures within premises immediate effect efforts also underway larger reduce density resident transferring among alternative accommodation period support provided workers6 continue paid salaries duration quarantine period absence work treated paid hospitalisation leave part leave eligibility employment manpower act efma employers eligible claim 100 daily quarantine allowance 7 arrangements made cater three meals day affected duration quarantine also issued reusable masks surgical masks thermometers hand sanitisers essentials keep safe comfortable 8 onsite medical support deployed support residing also implemented enhanced health screening measures requiring check report temperature twice daily well regular monitoring fever respiratory symptoms unwell isolated assessed medical personnel attention support provided companies affected workers9 companies providing essential services affected quarantine order supported arrangements made ensure essential services continue provided advisory operators10 operators living reminded importance maintaining high standards hygiene cleanliness safeguard health others living space safe distancing measures must strictly adhered include measures no inter mixing blocks floors stay within rooms minimise interactions 11 social responsibility critical slowing transmission need every individual play part fight against unwell even mild flu like symptoms should not work must see doctor immediately prevent spreading illness others ministry health ministry manpower5 april 2020wow 100 per day employers even pay much

"I think it's good from a purely scientific perspective. I work in physics, so I try to understand things through that lens. This is a few weakly coupled systems; the dorms is weakly coupled to the wider population. The coupling goes via one of two routes: non-dorm FWs, and healthcare/isolation facility workers. Separating non-dorm FWs is a good proxy for the coupling strength, which I'm sure MOH keeps an eye on. 

In addition, non-dorm FWs themselves are weakly coupled, cause in this case most of those infected are construction industry FWs living in non-dorm residences, such as on-site or shophouses.

"I made this graph for those who have been trying to grapple with estimating the risk to the general public as cases have been exploding. A lot of these cases are probably happening in foreign worker dorms and construction sites, relatively ""isolated"" from the general public, but MOH has not provided a breakdown.

I did this using the data at  []()  and ordering by local transmission and nationality. Classifying whether a case is likely linked to a foreign worker dorm or construction site is inexact. Basically all Bangladeshi adult males are assumed to be dorm-related; I also classified all Indian (nationality) males confirmed after Mar-31 to be dorm-related. China nationals and Myanmar nationals were only classified as dorm-related if they were officially linked. Obviously there could be errors.

The spike at 7th April is horrifying. It is a sum of what was announced on 7th April, plus a lot of cases announced yesterday were actually attributed to the 7th. This way of announcing also means that a lot more cases confirmed yesterday could be added today; this is not a real dip.

Is it justified to fine the dormitory owners and make them foot the medical bill partially?-12643698SINGAPORE: Singapore reported a record 447 new COVID-19 cases on Wednesday (Apr 15), taking the national total to 3,699.

Five are work permit holders living outside the dormitories. I believe Minister Jos said she already got tell the dorm owners to beef up controls? So where does the buck stop?

"1) Bringing in 10 foreign workers using a hammer is just disingenuous to the work they are doing. Give some actual level of research if you want to make a proposal that upgrading tech will significantly reduce the need for foreign workers.

How many skilled workers are needed to operate the vehicle, what is the lump-sum cost of investment and what is the upkeep cost? How much can you save with this technological upgrade that will eliminate maybe half of foreign worker workforce? How much training is necessary and how long will it take to implement?

""Just upgrade lah"" is something you hear too often from ignorant bosses and ignorant masses. It provides absolutely zero solution, and zero steps towards the solution. Ideas are cheap, execution is everything.

2) I can agree with this. However, you talk about capitalism in your third point. Don't allow the successful to have landed property, lose the successful. This disgusting world you are living in is controlled by the 1%.

Then again, how much landed space do you really think that will clear up?  I don't think that shit will be the solution to this problem here.

3) You don't need to solve the problem, but unless you actually tried to tackle the problem you don't understand why this is a problem that's so damned hard to solve. Logistic is everything.

When there’s a confirmed cluster and advice has been given to reduce social distancing, why are some of them still standing at the corridors looking down on crowds congregating on the ground floor? That’s only going to worsen the outbreak. 

My NS and reservist was served in a compound with just such living conditions. 
The bunk beds were packed so close together that I could touch the edge neighboring bunk bed when I reach my arms out from my bed. There was no metal cabinets between as there was just no space for it. 
There was a table in the middle of the room but if people were to sit there, you wouldn’t be able to walk to the other side of the room - you had to walk out of the room and go to the other side via the corridor. 
As NSFs we brought in our own fans as the air circulation in the room was just shit. 
During reservist, the building I was housed in had problematic pipes. You’d better be the first or second batch of people to bathe as the whole bathing area will be flooded up to the ankle if you were slow. 


As much as the foreign workers are housed in less than ideal conditions that many of us wouldn’t want to live in given a choice, they made the choice to come to Singapore to earn money.

"Just a tiny virus karang Kabo.If war time all just hug n cry in parliammentAs the global infection rate and death toll from the Covid-19 pandemic race upwards, people are playing the blame game, and it’s resulting in fraught relations and strained bilateral ties.Thanks to Lawrence Wong’s words, “hindsight” is now a word in popular usage. It’s easy for people to criticize their govts’ handling of the virus outbreak, but they have the wisdom of hindsight. And with hindsight, govts and their virus-fighting task force can now see there were alternatives and they would do things differently. What is easy to notice in hindsight was, alas, not at all obvious at the time. Everybody can be wise after the event.Those who have foresight are a rare breed while those who have the benefit of past experiences of virus outbreaks or have read a lot about them are plentiful. The former are foresighted, original thinkers who foresee warning signs and may come up with proactive steps to combat the coronavirus. The latter, with the advantage of hindsight, are able to dispense good advice, and I’ve seen plenty of such concerned, well-meant folks advising others to wear mask always, minimize social contact, avoid the crowds, dissolve crowded living conditions and so on and so forth. Their ideas were derived from previous epidemic experiences, thus they aren’t original.Mr Lawrence’s statement of “not having the luxury of the benefit of hindsight” is, to all intents and purposes, an admission of the authorities’ lack of foresight. Maybe the elected representatives of the people are somewhat good at governing the country, but when it comes to snuffiing out an unknown, invisible enemy that remains elusive and a real handful, they’re found wanting. It’s a difficult warfare, when you think about it, fighting public enemy number one not on the battle field but by staying at home! Not surprisingly, some countries have actually thrown in the towel.  With Lawrence’s admission of failure, shall we overlook their lack of success, at least for now?",,2020-11-04 02:00:00,sgtalk,tiny karang kabo war time hug n cry parliammentas global infection rate death toll pandemic race upwards people playing blame game resulting fraught relations strained bilateral ties thanks lawrence wong words hindsight word popular usage easy people criticize govts handling outbreak wisdom hindsight hindsight govts fighting task force see alternatives would things differently easy notice hindsight alas not obvious time everybody wise event foresight rare breed benefit past experiences outbreaks read lot plentiful former foresighted original thinkers foresee warning signs may come proactive steps combat latter advantage hindsight able dispense good advice seen plenty concerned well meant folks advising others wear mask always minimize social contact avoid crowds dissolve crowded living conditions forth ideas derived previous epidemic experiences thus original mr lawrence statement not luxury benefit hindsight intents purposes admission authorities lack foresight maybe elected representatives people somewhat good governing country comes snuffiing unknown invisible enemy remains elusive real handful found wanting difficult warfare think fighting public enemy number one not battle field staying home not surprisingly countries actually thrown towel lawrence admission failure shall overlook lack success least

My point if you actually bothered the rest of my comment instead of just focusing on the semantics is that it's unfair of the article to lump ALL the dorms together as lacking the proper standards.

"""they didn't know the risk"" might be letting them off way too lightly.

in 2015 when the dorms bill was passed, multiple MPs mentioned outbreaks of infectious diseases.

  
**Mr Gan Thiam Poh:** Whether it is a smaller dorm with a few hundred residents or a bigger one with 1,000, similar problems could arise. In the event of an infectious disease outbreak, racial or national tension, for example, the tipping point can be reached at 100 or 200 workers. 

**Yeo Guat Kwang:** the licensing framework will no doubt enhance the ability to deal with large-scale public and personal security, and even health and also pandemic incidents arising within dormitories. 

**Lee Bee Wah:** I would think putting a few hundred people under a roof is a sizeable crowd. It poses challenges to manage even with just 50 people under one roof, from fire safety, cooking area, toilets to space for clothes. Failure to manage the living quarters of a few hundred people can certainly give way to problems in terms of public health and safety, security and public order.

**Ms Foo Mee Har:** I am also pleased with the requirement for sick bay isolation facilities to contain any infectious disease outbreak, which could spread quickly in a densely populated dormitory.

**Tan Chuan Jin:** We are also aware of healthcare concerns. For smaller dorms or smaller accommodation spaces, when outbreaks happen, you can manage it, you have quarantine. But when you have a much larger dorm, the requirements are quite different, the scale is very different. We need to weave this into the design of the dormitories themselves.",,2020-04-17 01:06:08,reddit,didn know risk might letting way lightly 2015 bill passed multiple mps mentioned outbreaks infectious diseases mr gan thiam poh whether smaller hundred residents bigger one 1 000 similar problems could arise event infectious disease outbreak racial national tension example tipping point reached 100 200 yeo guat kwang licensing framework no doubt enhance ability deal large scale public personal security even health also pandemic incidents arising within lee bee wah would think putting hundred people roof sizeable crowd poses challenges manage even 50 people one roof fire safety cooking area toilets space clothes failure manage living quarters hundred people certainly give way problems terms public health safety security public order ms foo mee har also pleased requirement sick bay isolation facilities contain infectious disease outbreak could spread quickly densely populated tan chuan jin also aware healthcare concerns smaller smaller accommodation spaces outbreaks happen manage quarantine much larger requirements quite different scale different need weave design

"Did you honestly think MOM/MOH failed to foresee this? They probably did because every individual in Singapore had a higher probability to be infected when we allowed tens of thousands of msians to come into Singapore when MCO was implemented there as well as the returning Singaporeans from abroad. None of the msians served a 14 day SHN while it took some time before returning citizens were quarantined in hotels. Some clusters have already formed there and then and it's untraceable. Could even be linked originally from Msia/western countries.

Especially so for the FW workers who may be dealing with medical waste or waste in general. Used masks from an unknowingly infected carrier etc.. Transmission in this case was inevitable but our strategy in dealing with the virus at that time was reactive to the facts present at hand...

TBH I'm sure they were probably just crossing their fingers that the virus doesn't get to our FW workers dormitories. How could they not foresee? Social distancing was already being preached before the spread in the dormitories and any retard in MOM can tell you that those dormitories are not benchmarks of safe distancing.

It was just that the authorities are just biding their time waiting for it to happen before they 'react' to the 'facts' once again. For years MOM has nv really been a champion of FW rights. It's really evident now because you see all the dirt surfacing about how they are treated by their employers and how dorm operators are allowed to get away scot free for their deplorable management. It really is a case of out of sight out of mind. It has really been rotten for quite awhile and this covid19 truly brought out the stink.

Seriously there needs to be heavy enforcement and penalties for errant employers not just those of FW labourers but those of any immigrant (hello fake degree mills). What we lack sorely is an independent ombudsman that doesn't scream conflict of interest. We really exposed ourselves greatly when we allowed such a sizeable workforce from Msia to enter or risk crippling our economy. We have become far too dependent on cheap labour. It's a sick addiction. We need to think about what life's like without them. I'm not advocating for an exodus but a healthy sizeable reduction where we can still stand on our 2 feet or at least hobble along. Delicate balancing act way above my pay grade. Simply put, businesses have to innovate and invest towards less labour intensive technologies because it's damn certain no Singaporean can compete with the wages of a msian living in msia. Its simple mathematics.

PA grassroots leaders helloooo?? Too many scratching of backs within our govt and associated businesses. We need proper investigative journalism to call out these folks because they have sat on their high horses far too long to the detriment of greater society. In short.. follow the money.

I'm more pissed at MOM allowing the labour situation to be the state it is in now then the covid19 numbers. It was a time bomb that has been ticking for years prior to this. The reform doesn't just need to come in addressing migrant workers' living and working conditions in the near immediate future but as well our will to wean ourselves off cheap foreign labour so that we are not vulnerable to their absence as well as making businesses pay a liveable wage to the local workforce. It should also be legislated that no CEO should earn 1000 times the lowest paid employee to push for a more equitable distribution of wealth within a company. I have a dream...

In a dark way I'm kinda glad that covid19 has happened the way it did if not all these issues will never come to light and remain under the rug. It will definitely cause many countries around the world to look inwards as well and we are no exception. This globalisation machine needs some major recalibration before more Trump-like politics take over the world and I'm speaking as someone who is pro globalisation.

PAP's intention of capitalising on this period to hold elections to have us riding on the ""feel good"" wave when our numbers were not that crappy have backfired big time. It really speaks of their arrogance in insulting our intelligence. They did the same with LKY's death back in 2015 to great success. There are so many domestic issues to be debated and addressed before voters can exercise their rights in an informed manner. But I'm also guessing their arrogance is fuelled by our political ignorance. So people need to be less apolitical unless you're on either side of the camp no matter what. There should be more than one voice in a healthy society were the words muttered by the chinese Dr. Li Wenliang who blew the whistle on this virus.

">**But guess what? The workers will still be eating together and working together. Do people understand how infectious this virus is? Even healthcare workers in full PPE can still catch it. Confirm will still kenna. Who are we kidding?** 

For someone who claims to know statistics well, Ben really has a very poor understanding with how infections and distancing work. From a large population standpoint, infections are **not** a ""one-and-done"" deal. Statistics is hard to understand, but let me break it down for everyone. When you social distance for 23 hours a day, just because for the last hour you have dinner with friends, it doesnt mean that those 23 hours are somehow ""wasted"". If that were the case, we would ban everyone from leaving home even for groceries. 

Instead, the **probability** of you catching the virus has been lowered through distancing. Instead of 100 social interactions a day, distancing lowers that number to 1. Now your probability of getting infected is reduced by 99%. It doesnt stay at 100% just because you had that 1 social interaction. 

Its stupid to think that the **probability** of catching and spreading the virus would still be the same just because people **work and eat together.** 

If dorms had more space, we could have reduced the probability of FWs catching and spreading the disease. On a population-level, this would translate to concrete and significant reductions in the number of people infected. Ben Leong is a joke of a prof if he cant understand simple laws of probability and chance.

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 876 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Sunday (10 May) noon, bringing the total to 23,336.

> The vast majority of the new cases are foreign workers living in dorms, said the ministry. Three cases are Singaporeans/permanent residents.

> The MOH said more details will be shared when its daily press release is issued at night.

> More than 50 clusters linked to foreign worker dormitories have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Tuas View Dormitory and Sungei Tengah Lodge.

> The three are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some 400,000 foreign workers live in dorms here in Singapore.

> This story will be updated later.

> The ministry on Saturday confirmed that 2,296 patients have fully recovered from the infection. Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while 23 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Apart from the 20 COVID-related deaths, six patients who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including a 44-year-old Bangladeshi man who died of a heart attack on Tuesday.

> As of 4 May, the ministry has conducted 175,604 swab tests, of which 123,525 were done on unique individuals.

"It’s alarming how the government is pushing the narrative that foreign worker cases are significantly increasing but community transmission is decreasing. They can call it “local transmission” if that helps. 

Isn’t the infection of thousands of these workers the result of “community transmission”? How did they get it from one another? Local transmission of course. 

Calling it foreign cases only alludes to the fact that they are foreigners. But they live on the same land as you, and got the cases here locally! 

The Govt logic is simple: if you discount these workers as members of the community, you can report low community transmission. Problem solved. 

It’s truly pathetic that the people who live in ivory towers and take pride in the magnificent infrastructure of Singapore have no regard for those who built them! 

Take your money and shut up. If you behave in a way that undermines the Govt, all the money will be taken back. And without the money, what else is there in life? It’s hard to argue with people who take home hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. They can’t see beyond that money. So unless you have much of it, your life isn’t worth much.

"SINGAPORE  Foreign workers have been in the authorities sight early on in the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore at the start of the year, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on Monday (4 May).Delivering a ministerial statement in Parliament, she explained how the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) helped to prevent imported cases by limiting the return of work pass holders and monitoring returnees compliance with Leaves of Absence and Stay-Home Notices, among other things.Throughout this period, migrant workers were also on our radar, said Teo.Back in January, soon after the multi-ministry task force was set up, MOM reached out to dormitory operators to be more vigilant and to step up hygiene. In fact, one of the earliest media conferences that Minister Lawrence Wong and I held was at the Tuas View Dormitory, after we inspected their quarantine facilities in early February, she said.Wong helms the National Development Ministry and co-chairs the Multi-Ministry Taskforce tackling the spread of the virus.Teo added, We produced materials in the workers native languages to encourage them to take steps to protect themselves. Subsequently, non-essential facilities in the dormitories like gyms and TV rooms were closed. Meal-times and recreational hours were staggered. Intermixing between blocks was stopped.MOM officers also fanned out on weekends, to advise migrant workers to observe safe distancing measures and disperse big groups that were gathering at popular hangouts.Narrow focus on rooming arrangements may not prevent recurrenceIn February, the authorities detected the first COVID-19 cluster involving migrant workers at a construction site at Seletar Aerospace Heights. The five workers stayed at five different locations, only two of which were dormitories, Teo noted.Thereafter, there was no indication of higher prevalence of COVID-19 among migrant workers, compared to the general community, she said.Several MPs had raised queries on the outbreak of COVID-19 in dormitories. Jurong GRC MP Ang Wei Neng asked, among other things, about the lessons to be drawn from the management of dormitories and if safe distancing can be practically practised in the existing purpose-built dormitories.Meanwhile, Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng asked if MOM would consider raising the minimum gross floor area of 4.5 square metres for each resident in a foreign workers' dormitory; and not including the basic living facilities - such as living quarters, kitchen, dining, and toilet areas - in the computation for the minimum gross floor area.Nominated MPs Walter Theseira and Anthea Ong also asked if a Committee of Inquiry would be appointed to probe the COVID-19 outbreak in the dormitories.Responding, Teo said epidemiological findings show that within the dormitories which have clusters, not all blocks or rooms are equally affected. And across the different dormitories, infected workers were linked via common work sites.At the work sites, it was not uncommon for the infected workers to take breaks together, share food and utensils. Likewise, infected workers from different dormitories had gathered during their rest days to socialise and shop, for example at Mustafa. Back in the dormitories, workers spent time with their friends, cooking, eating and relaxing together, said Teo.The virus may have spread through all of these activities, much like how it spread among family members, religious groups and even colleagues, she added.Teo also noted that most infected workers showed mild symptoms of the virus and that many cases were uncovered only due to active case-finding or swab-taking.This may explain why up to the middle of March, the cases of workers at the dormitories testing positive were few and far between. Once evidence emerged that the virus had spread in the dormitories, we decided to deal with it squarely and quickly, and mobilise whole-of-government resources, the minister said.She added, Multiple channels of transmission among migrant workers, as appear to be the case, also means that we need a multi-faceted approach to dealing with the outbreak. A narrow focus on rooming arrangements may not prevent a recurrence. This consideration underpins the comprehensive approach of the Taskforce.-19-m...083406682.htmltrying to douse the fire with oil  They should jsut admit they imposed the social distancing measures to late lah.",,2020-04-05 17:50:00,hardwarezone,singapore authorities sight early outbreak singapore start year said manpower minister josephine teo monday 4 may delivering ministerial statement parliament explained ministry manpower mom helped prevent imported limiting return work pass holders monitoring returnees compliance leaves absence stay home notices among things throughout period also radar said teo back january soon multi ministry task force set mom reached operators vigilant step hygiene fact one earliest media conferences minister lawrence wong held tuas view inspected quarantine facilities early february said wong helms national development ministry co chairs multi ministry taskforce tackling spread teo added produced materials native languages encourage take steps protect subsequently non essential facilities like gyms tv rooms closed meal times recreational hours staggered intermixing blocks stopped mom officers also fanned weekends advise observe safe distancing measures disperse big groups gathering popular hangouts narrow focus rooming arrangements may not prevent recurrence february authorities detected first cluster involving construction site seletar aerospace heights five stayed five different locations two teo noted thereafter no indication higher prevalence among compared general community said several mps raised queries outbreak jurong grc mp ang wei neng asked among things lessons drawn management safe distancing practically practised existing purpose built meanwhile nee soon grc mp louis ng asked mom would consider raising minimum gross floor area 4 5 square metres resident not including basic living facilities living quarters kitchen dining toilet areas computation minimum gross floor area nominated mps walter theseira anthea ong also asked committee inquiry would appointed probe outbreak responding teo said epidemiological findings show within clusters not blocks rooms equally affected across different infected linked via common work sites work sites not uncommon infected take breaks together share food utensils likewise infected different gathered rest days socialise shop example mustafa back spent time friends cooking eating relaxing together said teo may spread activities much like spread among family members religious groups even colleagues added teo also noted infected showed mild symptoms many uncovered due active case finding swab taking may explain middle march testing positive far evidence emerged spread decided deal squarely quickly mobilise whole government resources minister said added multiple channels transmission among appear case also means need multi faceted approach dealing outbreak narrow focus rooming arrangements may not prevent recurrence consideration underpins comprehensive approach taskforce 083406682 htmltrying douse fire oil should jsut admit imposed social distancing measures late

"basically half the population at risk if the dorm cases explode.it's basically out of control at this moment.There is another issue with the dormitory isolation. I visited a few before and each room have at least 4 workers sharing (number varies with each different dormitory).

"> # Record 287 new Covid-19 cases in S'pore, links found between Mustafa Centre and clusters in foreign worker dormitories

> SINGAPORE - Singapore saw a sharp spike of 287 coronavirus cases on Thursday (April 9), with the majority linked to foreign worker dormitories.

> This is the highest daily number reported to date and brings the total number of cases here to 1,910, as the global number of cases crossed the 1.5 million mark.

> Coordinating Minister for National Security Teo Chee Hean is now advising the multi-ministry taskforce on handling the Covid-19 situation in foreign worker dormitories, said National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, noting that the police and Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) are involved in operations there.

> To cut the chain of transmission in dormitories, thousands of foreign workers who are healthy - especially those working in essential services - will be moved to army camps, floating hotels, and vacant Housing Board blocks.

> Singapore has also started active case finding and is swab-testing workers in various dormitories, said the Health Ministry's (MOH) director of medical services Kenneth Mak at a press conference on Thursday.

> Preliminary investigations have linked the cluster at Mustafa Centre with clusters at the construction site at Project Glory and five dormitories.

> Associate Professor Mak said the ministry believes that foreign workers had visited Mustafa Centre, where some employees had fallen ill, and gotten infected there.

> They then transmitted the infection to their co-workers, who subsequently infected others at their dormitories.

> ""Many had very mild symptoms and so they continued to work, that's why there was a delay in picking them up,"" said Mr Wong, who chairs the ministerial task force along with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong. It is likely that the virus had been spreading in dormitories for some time, he said.

>

> 

> Mr Wong said Singapore is dealing with two separate infection spreads.

> In foreign worker dormitories, numbers are rising sharply, he noted. But in the wider community, numbers are more stable.

> Related Story Coronavirus: Sungei Tengah Lodge is 4th foreign worker dorm gazetted as isolation area

> ""This is a major and urgent issue that requires active intervention,"" he said. ""That is why we decided to put in more resources and set up a dedicated task force focusing on dorms.""

> On Tuesday, the Manpower Ministry (MOM) had announced the formation of an inter-agency task force to provide support to foreign workers and dormitory operators.

> The task force will ensure the well-being of workers and improve their living conditions by supporting dormitory operators as they implement ""circuit-breaker"" measures.

> MOM is supported by the Ministry of Health, National Environment Agency, the SAF, the Singapore Police Force, Migrant Workers' Centre and other agencies.

> Explaining the Government's decision to set up a task force, Mr Wong said: ""We cannot rely solely on dorm operators any more, given the current situation.""

> Manpower Minister Josephine Teo noted that there has been no cluster in dormitories until recently, even though a number of foreign workers have tested positive for the virus.

> ""Bear in mind that dorms are home to foreign workers,"" she added. ""Within dorms workers interact with each other very regularly, very closely, they're like family, so the risk of transmission was always there.""

> Workers will now not be able to prepare their own meals, to reduce human contact, and cleanliness and hygiene have been stepped up. Existing sick bays will also be scaled up to take care of workers that need to be isolated.

> Related Story Coronavirus explainers: What you should know to protect yourself

> Related Story Coronavirus visual guide: Interactive graphics on the pandemic

> Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said that despite circuit breaker measures kicking in on Tuesday, social gatherings are still taking place. More than 10,000 written advisories have been issued over the past two days to those who did not observe safe distancing.

> ""This cannot continue,"" he said.

> Mr Wong added that enforcement efforts will be stepped up against those who continue to flout safe-distancing measures.

> ""We hope Singaporeans will comply not just because of enforcement efforts but really out of a necessity for all of us to do our part,"" he said.

"-wo...gy-jo-teo/When asked in Parliament on Monday (May 4) whether the government will consider issuing an apology to migrant workers in Singapore on the Covid-19 outbreak in dormitories, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said that none of the workers she interacted with have demanded an apology.Teo said that based on interactions and feedback she received from migrant workers, they instead ask about the present situation, how not to fall sick, and if they do, how to ensure their wages are paid.Singapore's migrant worker community has come under focus during the Covid-19 outbreak, with 90 per cent of the country's 18,205 cases concentrated amongst work permit holders.eo was responding to a question posed by Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) Anthea Ong:""Will the government consider issuing an apology to the migrant workers, given the dismal conditions that they are currently in, because the conditions of the dormitories and all the other conditions? Especially now that they're in complete lockdown, for the sake and safety of Singaporeans.""Responding to Ong, Teo replied that she had not come across any migrant workers asking for an apology:""Ms. Anthea Ong asked about an apology. We interact very closely with the workers themselves, on a very regular basis at the dormitories, and even outside the dormitories whenever I'll ask teams, you know, follow up on their requests and feedback.I think what they’re focused on is how we can help them to handle this present situation, not fall sick, and if they fall sick, help take care of them, how to look after their wages being paid, how to ensure that they can send money home.These are the things that they have asked of us. I have not come across one single migrant worker himself that has demanded an apology.""This Ah Ong is real goondu. What about the local community got infected?

"> # COVID-19: Singapore confirms 344 new cases, with seven community cases

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 344 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Saturday (6 June) noon, bringing the total to 37,527.

> Of them, the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories, said the ministry, while seven others are classified as cases in the community.

> “Based on our investigations so far, there are seven cases in the community, of whom three are Singaporeans/permanent residents and four are work pass holders,” it added.

> The ministry added that more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of over 2,700 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Jurong Penjuru Dormitory, and Tuas View Dormitory.

> The four are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some 400,000 such workers live in dorms here in Singapore.

> National Development Minister and co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce Lawrence Wong had at a 12 May press conference said that some 20,000 infected foreign workers are expected to be discharged by end-May.

> This story will be updated later.

> With 305 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, a total of 24,209 – over 60 per cent of total cases here – here have fully recovered from the infection, said the MOH on Friday.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while four are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Over 12,000 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 24 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, nine others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and two whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> As of 1 June, the ministry has conducted 408,495 swab tests, of which 264,393 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 71,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 46,400 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

> The MOH has been publishing a list of locations visited by cases in the community for over 30 minutes since last Monday.

> This list – which excludes residences, workplaces, healthcare facilities, and public transport – will be updated on a rolling 14-day basis or one incubation period, the ministry said.

> As a precautionary measure, the MOH advised those who had been at these locations during the specified timings to monitor their health closely for 14 days from their date of visit.

> They have also been urged by the ministry to visit the doctor if they develop symptoms such as cough, sore throat, as well as fever and loss of taste or smell, and inform the doctor of their exposure history.

"> # Forum: Why foot the bill for dorm operators that have profited for years?

> Singaporeans have now learnt that operating mega dormitories for foreign workers is not a bad business at all (Rethink mega dorms beyond Covid-19 outbreak, May 14). For example, for the 2019 financial year, the net profits of Singapore Exchange-listed companies Centurion Corp, Wee Hur Holdings and Lian Beng Group from their dormitory and other businesses were $103.8 million, $34.9 million and $32.9 million, respectively.

> Singaporeans must therefore be puzzled as to why taxpayers will now be footing the bill for the increased operating costs incurred by such operators due to the dormitory lockdowns and stay-home notices (Govt to absorb added costs for dorm operators during circuit breaker, May 12).

> At a time when many deserving demands are competing for tight public finances, those who have profited for years from business models that have now come home to roost must not expect taxpayers to clean up after them.

">I said even if we took action earlier, the Dormitory spread will still happen because guess where those people are going to be locked down if we started it earlier.

Isn't this a convoluted reasoning? You are looking at it specifically from a time frame whereby it augments your statement.

ie There is community spread. The community spread has ALREADY reach the dormitory. Therefore an earlier lockdown, regardless, will still spread among the dormitory resulting in huge case numbers because of the conditions. Basically the only way for your statement to be true, you need a first spark to start the fire.

However, when ppl are talking about earlier lockdown, ppl meant it as a whole, to even prevent community spread(dormitory being an ideal hotspot does not equate to the virus will travel there by themselves) . Unless you are suggesting that an earlier lockdown WILL still result in spread because erm... magic? Because Taiwan definitely manage to prevent community spread by acting earlier.

"Wife of grassroots leader in workers dorm business, shows their Sentosa weekend party home to mediaIt was earlier reported that as of Wed (8 Apr) this week, active COVID-19 clusters have been found at 9 different foreign worker dormitories in Singapore.A few of the 9 are operated by companies linked to grassroots leaders of Peoples Association (PA). The top 2 foreign worker dormitories with the most number of confirmed COVID-19 cases as of yesterday (10 Apr) were S11 Dormitory (306 cases) and Westlite Toh Guan (69 cases). Both have been gazetted by the government as isolation areas under the Infectious Diseases Act.In particular, Westlite Toh Guan is run by public listed company Centurion Corporation Ltd, helmed by two PA grassroots leaders who are joint chairmen of the company: David Loh Kim Kang and Han Seng Juan. Han was awarded PBM in 2010 and BBM in 2015, while Loh got his PBM in 2011 and BBM in 2016.They were both given public service medals for helping out at Potong Pasir SMC under MP Sitoh Yih Pin. In the general election of 2011, PAP managed to wrestle back Potong Pasir from opposition and its now under PAP.Another board member of Centurion Corporation, Rajah & Tanns lawyer Chandra Mohan, is also a grassroots leader awarded with PBM and BBM in recognition of his contribution towards community services in Northwest Community Development Council (NWCDC).Hans Sentosa Cove weekend party home has rooms inspired by four seasonsFurther checks online revealed that socialite Susanna Kang is married to Han. In fact, 4 years ago, Mrs Han opened up their weekend party home at Sentosa Cove for reporters to take a look (Chic abodes: Two stylish women open up their homes).Mrs Han is said to be a fixture in society magazines, often seen wearing head-turning gowns and ensembles, complete with elaborate hairstyles.At the Hans Sentosa Cove weekend home, the ST reporter noted the creative streak in its design. Standing on a 9,000 sq ft plot of land, the expansive house is a weekend home and features rooms inspired by the four seasons, the reporter wrote. It is here that the family entertain friends and host dinners for close business partners about once a month, with as many as 100 people gathering at what has come to be known as the Party House.Apparently, Mrs Han wanted a house that has the wow factor for the purpose of entertaining guests. It was built in 2012. A curtain weighing more than 2,721kg imported from Germany and made of high-grade stainless steel cloaks the perimeter of the second floor. It can be pulled back to get an unblocked beautiful view of the sea.When guests arrive at the four-storey house, they descend a long flight of stairs into a cavernous basement. Mrs Han said, I meant for it to be like a runway, where guests can sashay and strut their stuff down the stairs. Its also the perfect spot to see the rest of the house. As you look up from the stairs, you get a good look at what else there is to explore.The basement is filled with futuristic-looking furniture from well-known brands and designers such as Italian label Moroso and renowned architect Zaha Hadid. An Hermes screen, made of a wood frame and scraps of crocodile skin taken from the cutting-room floor at the French luxury houses atelier, adds a luxurious touch. A luscious green wall, filled with creepers growing under ultraviolet light, is encased behind a misty glass screen, creating a tropical spring feel for the basement. Adding to that wild factor are two taxidermied peacocks that preen regally next to the bar.The dining room has a 22-seat custom-made table with bronzed legs and a high-gloss finish  the result of multiple layers of lacquer. It beautifully reflects American industrial designer Karim Rashids topograph-shaped chandelier that was made as part of Swarovskis Crystal Palace collection.The upper floors were designed for smaller break-out groups for relaxation especially after a nice dinner. On second level there are 3 rooms: One is a karaoke and media room, complete with decor of KTV lounges for the feel of the real thing, said Mrs Han. Another has a masculine vibe with a dark brown sofa by Italian furniture-maker Poltrona Frau and a well-stocked wine chiller. Here, the men can kick back and relax with cigars, while talking business, politics or any other matters. The third room simulates a chic ski resort cabin. Mrs Han has the air-conditioning ducts trained on this area so that the blast of cold air creates that icy feeling. The floor is covered in a fluffy, white carpet and there is a fireplace that runs on ethanol. It produces flames, but not heat.For parties around the pool, guests head to the summer room in the attic that is designed to look like a ships cabin. Sofa beds face the infinity pool outside. For movie nights, a hidden projector comes down and guests can kick back or sleep over if they want to and wake up to a sea view. I get my respite here. Its quite peaceful looking at the blue, open sea, she said.She described her Sentosa home as a modern kelong as it is surrounded by water but the family does not live there. Their family home is a good-class bungalow in Bukit Timah.(Pictures of the Hans Sentosa Cove weekend home from ST Photo):Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) warns about crammed condition in foreign worker dormitoriesMeanwhile, non-profit organization Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) has been warning about the crammed conditions in foreign worker dormitories being highly conducive to spread the coronavirus (Forum: Employers practices leave foreign workers vulnerable to infection, 23 Mar).Writing to ST Forum on 23 Mar, TWC2 said, Currently, foreign workers are housed 12 to 20 men per room in double-decker beds. They are transported to work on the back of lorries sitting shoulder to shoulder. Neither of these conditions conforms with social distancing. The risk of a new cluster among this group remains undeniable,TWC2 warned and advocated that new dormitory should require more space per head and no more than four persons to a room.On TWC2 website, it shows a picture of how crammed the condition is at a dormitory (Westlite Mandai) run by Hans company.Indeed, about a week later after TWC2 wrote to ST to warn everyone, clusters of COVID-19 started breaking out in different foreign worker dormitories.Perhaps Han should ask his wife to use her creative streak to also help design the Centurions foreign worker dormitories so that the workers can have less crammed spaces to live in?

"Singapore is looking ahead to a “recovery phase” for foreign workers currently isolated in dormitories to allow them to resume working safely, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said on Sunday (May 10).These workers, some of whom have recovered from Covid-19, will be able to return to work as various businesses eventually resume operations. This involves getting the workers tested to ensure they have properly recovered, and to continue monitoring their health, she said.The new system will involve the distribution of medical technology — including 20,000 pulse oximeters — to worker dormitories and other places they reside in, Mrs Teo added. A pulse oximeter gives an early warning of deteriorating health by measuring the level of oxygen in the blood.Conducting tele-medical consultations will also be used for foreign workers using tele-kiosks at dormitories or via mobile phones. Since April 25, about 400 consultations between doctors and foreign workers have taken place via phones, the Ministry of Manpower stated in a media release on Sunday.“The whole point of the recovery is aligned with our approach to eventually allow more activities in the economy to resume,” said Mrs Teo, who spoke to reporters after attending the unveiling of a new Covid-19 medical facility at the JTC Space @ Tuas, catering to foreign workers who do not reside in purpose-built dormitories.The vast majority of new Covid-19 cases in Singapore in recent weeks have been among foreign workers housed in dormitories.Mrs Teo said: “We are very mindful that from the worker standpoint, ultimately they are here in Singapore to work. And then from their employers' standpoint, workers are here to support their business. The main objective of this recovery phase is how to enable this to happen in a safe way.”She said to achieve this, changes in where the foreign workers live and where they work have to be made.Mrs Teo added that the ministry is now planning a “whole stream of activities” in order to bring about safe living, as well as safe working for these workers, noting that the virus spreads quickly due to communal living, even if hygiene levels are high.“By safe living and safe working, what we will also enable is for the businesses to continue in a safe way,” she said.Mrs Teo said the overall operation is “a fairly large piece of work” and that a technical media briefing would be held later to provide further details.A very important aspect of this recovery phase will be focused on how to strengthen health monitoring and surveillance in dormitories, she said. The ministry is, therefore, looking to use technology to enable more effective medical monitoring.“We are introducing new measures that will help us to look after the health conditions, and to do the health surveillance of our foreign workers in a more comprehensive way,” she said.“And we hope that by doing so, we will be able to help the individual worker prevent the recurrence if he has already been infected, or for those who have not been infected to prevent them from falling sick in the first place,” said Mrs Teo.The*new Covid-19 medical facility, which will start operations on Monday, includes a medical post and a swab isolation facility with 150 cubicles for foreign workers to reside in. Of those, 120 will be for workers waiting for their results while the other 30 will be for those who have tested positive. Results usually come back within two to three days.The medical post is the fifth of its kind outside of those that are available in the 43 purpose-built dormitories. The swab isolation facility is the third of its kind.A worker will be transported to the medical facility by shuttle bus if he feels the onset of symptoms of acute respiratory infection. He will be assessed by a doctor at the medical post, who will then determine if the worker is required to take the swab test or not.USING TECHNOLOGYMrs Teo said that about 8,000 pulse oximeters had been issued, with another 12,000 to be given out progressively. The priority is to issue the small, easy-to-use devices to workers with Covid-19 displaying mild symptoms in order to see if their health deteriorates.“So, in all, we're looking at maybe about 20,000 pulse oximeters that will be made available to our foreign workers in the purpose-built dorms, factory-converted dorms as well as the construction temporary quarters.”Another technological innovation at the medical facility is a tele-kiosk machine which facilitates video consultations with doctors and is connected to devices that can monitor vital signs such as blood pressure, oxygen saturation and temperature.Workers who are awaiting their results can connect to a doctor through this machine as doctors are available at all times and medication will be delivered to the workers if necessary. Eight tele-kiosks have been installed in other dormitories.A teleconsultation service via personal mobile devices to provide care after hours has also been set up, enabling workers to contact doctors through WhatsApp video call. Medication will be delivered to the workers if necessary.“When the workers eventually return to work their work hours are not likely to be the same for each and every one of them,” Mrs Teo*said.“Some of the workers may return to the dormitory at a time where the medical outposts cannot remain open,*so we have to look at what are some of the more sustainable ways to continue to perform this health monitoring, which is a very important part of taking care of the foreign workers.”She added: “We want them to stay healthy. We want them to be able to continue to support their employer. In order to be able to do so, we must find ways to protect their health. And if there is any cluster that is forming, we need to have some way of detecting it so that we can act fast.”-covid-19",,2020-10-05 22:55:00,hardwarezone,singapore looking ahead recovery phase currently isolated allow resume working safely manpower minister josephine teo said sunday may 10 recovered able return work various businesses eventually resume operations involves getting tested ensure properly recovered continue monitoring health said new system involve distribution medical technology including 20 000 pulse oximeters places reside mrs teo added pulse oximeter gives early warning deteriorating health measuring level oxygen blood conducting tele medical consultations also used using tele kiosks via mobile phones since april 25 400 consultations doctors taken place via phones ministry manpower stated media release sunday whole point recovery aligned approach eventually allow activities economy resume said mrs teo spoke reporters attending unveiling new medical facility jtc space tuas catering not reside purpose built vast majority new singapore recent weeks among housed mrs teo said mindful standpoint ultimately singapore work employers standpoint support business main objective recovery phase enable happen safe way said achieve changes live work made mrs teo added ministry planning whole stream activities order bring safe living well safe working noting spreads quickly due communal living even hygiene levels high safe living safe working also enable businesses continue safe way said mrs teo said overall operation fairly large piece work technical media briefing would held later provide details important aspect recovery phase focused strengthen health monitoring surveillance said ministry therefore looking use technology enable effective medical monitoring introducing new measures help us look health conditions health surveillance comprehensive way said hope able help individual prevent recurrence already infected not infected prevent falling sick first place said mrs teo new medical facility start operations monday includes medical post swab isolation facility 150 cubicles reside 120 waiting results 30 tested positive results usually come back within two three days medical post fifth kind outside available 43 purpose built swab isolation facility third kind transported medical facility shuttle bus feels onset symptoms acute respiratory infection assessed doctor medical post determine required take swab test not using technologymrs teo said 8 000 pulse oximeters issued another 12 000 given progressively priority issue small easy use devices displaying mild symptoms order see health deteriorates looking maybe 20 000 pulse oximeters made available purpose built factory converted well construction temporary quarters another technological innovation medical facility tele kiosk machine facilitates video consultations doctors connected devices monitor vital signs blood pressure oxygen saturation temperature awaiting results connect doctor machine doctors available times medication delivered necessary eight tele kiosks installed teleconsultation service via personal mobile devices provide care hours also set enabling contact doctors whatsapp video call medication delivered necessary eventually return work work hours not likely every one mrs teo said may return time medical outposts cannot remain open look sustainable ways continue perform health monitoring important part taking care added want stay healthy want able continue support employer order able must find ways protect health cluster forming need way detecting act fast
