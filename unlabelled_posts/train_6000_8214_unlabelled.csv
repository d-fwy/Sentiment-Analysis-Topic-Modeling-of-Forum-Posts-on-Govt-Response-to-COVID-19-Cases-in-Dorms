Those who've run the dorms have been doing this years, and there's very little chance of them changing their ways, and if at all they do, there's a question of whether they'll do it fast enough.

Wonder what happened to the message? The moment I clicked post, it disappeared and I don't see it on his wall except for only his messages.*Hong Kong, with much domestic unrest and violence, managed to do a better job than your government in dealing with the COVID19 pandemic crisis. Meaning they were in the midst of a crisis management, when this COVID19 pandemic crisis happened, and they managed it so well too. In fact quite a number of countries, Taiwan, New Zealand, South Korea, etc, with higher population than us with Ministers earning much less than you and your Ministers, have carried out a better crisis management, with foresight. You and your Ministers are earning an exorbitant amount of salary and failing miserably during this COVID19 pandemic crisis. Your worth should be evident, not during the good times but times like this adverse condition. It's fine if you and your government had erred but at least be accountable and apologetic, instead of going on your defence to give excuses. This is not the first time. Each and every time you have messed it up, it's always going on the defence with excuses. Never apologetic with reasons. It's fine to be wrong. No one is perfect. For at least once be bold enough to be accountable, apologetic and be outright about your next course of action.

"The Republic has been aggressively testing foreign workers for the coronavirus, even those who are well and have no symptoms, the multi-ministry task force told a press conference on Tuesday (April 21).Authorities have refrained from testing every single person in the larger community because of their sheer number, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, who co-chairs the task force.Singapore has a ""very strategic way"" of conducting tests, he explained.He said: ""We have millions of Singaporeans, and we will not be able to test every one of them. So... we do targeted testing.""For instance, tests are done on essential workers who need to go out to ensure that they are not carrying the infection while going to work.A random testing programme, known as sentinel surveillance, is also used to pick up cases in the community that would otherwise have gone undetected.This programme is aimed at finding people who have the virus, but have very mild symptoms or do not meet criteria that will make them a suspect case.Such testing has revealed that there are still cases of Covid-19 being transmitted in the community, some of whom remain infectious despite mild symptoms, said Mr Gan.""That is why we need to put in extra effort (with) these circuit breaker measures, to make sure that we are able to bring down these community cases, particularly those that are unlinked,"" he said.The Health Ministry's Director of Medical Services, Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, said that although the number of tests conducted varied on a daily basis, it could rise to between 2,800 and 3,000 on some days.Between 1,500 and 2,500 of these tests were being carried out on foreign workers.Mr Gan explained that testing helped to give a sense of the prevalence of Covid-19 in the dormitories, allowing the authorities to identify those where the disease is more widespread, and determine the level of response.It also enables those in charge to identify infected patients and get them the necessary medical attention.Noting that over 5,000 foreign workers had already tested positive for the virus, Assoc Prof Mak said: ""We've in fact (tested) more than that, because there's also those (that) tested negative as well. So the number continues to grow.""But Singapore is prepared for the increased pace of testing. Earlier on Tuesday, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, in an address to the nation, said that in addition to developing and manufacturing its own test kits Singapore was also getting them from overseas.Mr Gan explained during the press conference that this was intended to help keep testing options open here.""We want to be able to also use different models, different test kits, different ways of testing,"" he said.He added that the purchase of test kits from overseas was also intended to help Singapore increase its testing capacity and capabilities, in order to prepare for the eventual lifting of circuit breaker measures.""Our testing is not just for now... as we progress in opening up our circuit breaker measures, we will need to increase our testing capability because we need to make sure that there is no transmission in the community - and in order to make sure that there's no transmission in the community, we need to test a lot more,"" he said.-on-foreign",,2020-04-21 22:27:00,hardwarezone,republic aggressively testing even well no symptoms multi ministry task force told press conference tuesday april 21 authorities refrained testing every single person larger community sheer number said health minister gan kim yong co chairs task force singapore strategic way conducting tests explained said millions singaporeans not able test every one targeted testing instance tests done essential need go ensure not carrying infection going work random testing programme known sentinel surveillance also used pick community would otherwise gone undetected programme aimed finding people mild symptoms not meet criteria make suspect case testing revealed still transmitted community remain infectious despite mild symptoms said mr gan need put extra effort circuit breaker measures make sure able bring community particularly unlinked said health ministry director medical services associate professor kenneth mak said although number tests conducted varied daily basis could rise 2 800 3 000 days 1 500 2 500 tests carried mr gan explained testing helped give sense prevalence allowing authorities identify disease widespread determine level response also enables charge identify infected patients get necessary medical attention noting 5 000 already tested positive assoc prof mak said fact tested also tested negative well number continues grow singapore prepared increased pace testing earlier tuesday prime minister lee hsien loong address nation said addition developing manufacturing test kits singapore also getting overseas mr gan explained press conference intended help keep testing options open want able also use different models different test kits different ways testing said added purchase test kits overseas also intended help singapore increase testing capacity capabilities order prepare eventual lifting circuit breaker measures testing not progress opening circuit breaker measures need increase testing capability need make sure no transmission community order make sure no transmission community need test lot said

"For a short term solution, yes you are right. However it would become another cycle hidden away from us in the future when the foreign workers and their living conditions becomes forgotten and the companies decide to start exploiting loopholes in the systems.

Collectively I still feel such situations could have been overall avoided if not for the fact that singaporeans have become an entitled nation. The hard truth is that no one would do their work for the meagre salary. Theres also the hard labour that is not enticing under the hot sun or stifled conditions within construction. We should have been learning from examples like Australia, where they pay their labour workers well and a huge bulk of the hard labour jobs consists of their own people. This also creates a sense of pride within our community.

Going back to the main point, if we as a nation has been in such a situation where we dont rely on foreign workforce, the housing situation might not have happened and any form of exploitation would have been greatly reduced which in turns lead up to the fact that when a pandemic occurs, which is does throughout history, such a scenario we see unfolding would not have occurred.

"The reason why it seems the burden is placed on you by me (and many others like me) is because you are the one making the claim that the current level of government attention toward the dorm problem is disproportionately high. I (and apparently, many others like me)  recognise the importance of tackling the dorm problem, and maintaining the same level of attention, effort, and expenditure of resources.

Quibbling over individual policies (and demanding for new alternatives that even the government hasn't figured out yet) is besides the point. The genesis of the argument is that you think government is placing too much emphasis on the dorm problem. I have told you why that is not the case - because the dorm problem IS the Singapore covid problem. 

Your comments seems to suggest the current measures taken on the dorm problem are considered ""enough"" - have they been?The cases have increased exponentially. The first isolation areas were gazetted on April 5, 18 days ago. Given the suspected incubation period is 14 days, does it seem like they are ""enough"" to contain the spread? I personally do not feel so.

Let me note here that I do not blame the government. I believe that they are, in good faith, doing their job to the best of their ability. I am merely positing that they should continue undertaking all that is necessary to curb the dorm problem. You are the one suggesting they should do less.

"Again, this is capitalism. If  the govt is doing the work in coming up with ideas and solutions to keep construction companies profitable, then is it really capitalism? Might as well keep the profits for ourselves then. The solution on our end is just set the minimum requirements, then let the market decide for themselves how they want to work things out. Its the same with other forms of regulations we have. Take the example of internet banking that is happening right now. Govt sets the minimum requirements and the private sector competes with each other for the license and figures it out for themselves how to get it done. We dont have to go into detail to tell them how to do it. You want government to provide them with programmers and coders and customer support staff? No. You set the floor, and let the companies do the work. That's the point of capitalism.

And if it ends up making things harder for the FW, then we adjust and try again. Policy is always open-ended in that sense.

"Weighing Singapore's response to the Covid-19 pandemicDid Singapore overlook Covid-19 cases in foreign worker dormitories; give wrong advice on mask-wearing; and is it too lax in its circuit breaker measures?-19-pandemicThe plaudits had come early for Singapore in its fight against the coronavirus.Around the world, epidemiologists and media reports held the country up as a model to emulate for bringing the outbreak under control with a strategy of aggressive testing, meticulous contact tracing and strict isolation.Yet, from being hailed by some as the ""gold standard"" in tackling the virus, the Republic is now referred to by others as a ""cautionary tale"" of how potent the coronavirus is as well as the risks of easing up on measures to contain it.This has led some to question the approach taken in recent weeks: Did the Government overlook the situation in the dormitories? Should mask-wearing have been mandated from the start? Could an earlier and stricter lockdown have prevented the current situation?Often, this is done with 20/20 hindsight. But with what is known about the virus being debunked week to week and the situation evolving daily, it is normal for people to feel uncertain and wonder if the authorities have got it right.BLINDSIDED BY BUGThe most pressing situation now is the one playing out in the purpose-built mega dormitories and factory-converted dorms housing over 320,000 of the 720,000 foreign work permit holders (excluding foreign domestic workers).An explosive growth in Covid-19 cases in these compounds has led to 19 of them being declared isolation zones as of Monday, while all other purpose-built accommodations housing foreign workers have been placed under partial lockdowns.Yesterday alone, close to 1,100 cases were recorded among foreign workers, and health experts warn that if the spread is not curtailed fast, deaths will almost be certain, and hospitals will be overstretched.Could this disaster have been prevented? Some critics believe so.The workers sleep 12 to 20 to a room, with even larger numbers sharing facilities like bathrooms and kitchens, and migrant worker groups have lobbied for better living conditions for years.On March 23, Transient Workers Count Too, or TWC2, had warned of a cluster possibly breaking out, given that the workers live in such close quarters that it is impossible to practise safe distancing.The non-governmental group had alluded to how this could be averted - it would require the rehousing of hundreds of thousands of workers. But it acknowledged that it is unrealistic for additional dormitories to be built in mere weeks or months.With attention at the time focused elsewhere, especially with the flurry of Singaporeans returning home from abroad having to be kept apart from the rest of the population to prevent the spread of the virus, it is doubtful that the public would have appreciated the need to peremptorily expend huge resources to rehouse workers from dormitories at the time.Yet, in the recent weeks alone, thousands of workers have had to be moved out of dormitories and into alternative housing at military camps, floating hotels and vacant Housing Board blocks, with more areas such as sports facilities and hotels set to be converted for such use.So inevitably the question has arisen of whether it could have been done before the super spreading event at Mustafa Centre seeded the infections in the dormitories.Several factors may have informed the decision to manage outbreaks as they happen, say experts.The first Covid-19 cases involving foreign workers in February had been successfully contained, and never ""exploded into big clusters"", in the words of Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the multi-ministry coronavirus task force.Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said this suggests that responses put in place such as testing, contact tracing and isolating cases were adequate.Also, precautions were already being taken at the compounds, with temperature checks, increased cleaning of shared spaces, and hand sanitisers for workers to use.Prof Teo said the current crisis at the dormitories was the result of what epidemiologists call a super spreading event that is difficult to predict.""This is what we mean by a very unfortunate event that, in hindsight, people will say we should have known,"" he added.Such events have driven epidemics and once they happen, it is crucial to quickly recognise and understand them to arrest the spread.On this count, Nanyang Technological University's Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine visiting professor Annelies Wilder-Smith believes the Government is on the right track in thinning out the dorms. But she warned that it is now a race against time and the infection could ""spread like a fire, and Singapore has to move faster than the speed of the virus"".At the same time, gazetting the worst-hit dorms as isolation areas is necessary to keep the infection from spilling over into the general population.Prof Teo cautioned that this should not be misconstrued as ""discrimination"", adding that such a classical public health response was also employed in Hong Kong during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) epidemic, when an entire apartment block had to be closed off.As long as workers are also being cared for and protected in the dorms, this is probably the best way to control the dormitory outbreak, said Professor Wilder-Smith.Both experts said that a lesson to take away from this is that the spread of Covid-19 can quickly go out of control in situations where people live side by side, not just in dormitories, but also in old folks' homes.TO MASK OR NOT?Another issue that is hotly debated now is whether the Government was wrong to urge people not to wear masks in the initial phase of the outbreak.Then, ministers had discouraged people from using masks, citing advice from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and other experts on the Sars-CoV-2 virus being spread through droplets and not aerosols.Officials also noted that in the light of a global shortage, it was best to conserve the use of such protective gear to ensure that it is available to medical professionals when they need it to care for patients.As more became known about the disease, the Government has in the past weeks changed its stance, distributing reusable masks to everyone and mandating the wearing of masks in public. While the WHO has maintained that healthy people do not need to wear masks, officials have acknowledged that it may become common practice.Some have called it a flip-flop.Others have attributed the rise in cases in Singapore to people not wearing masks, pointing to how in places like Taiwan, Hong Kong and South Korea, where the practice is commonplace, the numbers of infections have been kept low.But experts point out that these regions have also espoused other key public health responses to the pandemic such as rigorous testing, comprehensive contact tracing and strict isolationHas not wearing masks been detrimental here?Prof Teo said this is not borne out by the data on community transmission.Up until March 24, there had mostly been fewer than 10 cases of such transmissions a day, he said, adding that the numbers would have spiked by February had the limited use of masks been a big factor. With such small numbers of infected people roaming around in the community, the chances of people catching the disease when going about their daily life were also small, and there was thus no need for the widespread adoption of masks early on, he added.He likened the wearing of surgical masks in the early days to people wearing motorcycle helmets everywhere they go.""Does the helmet protect one from head injury? The answer is yes. But why does one not wear it to, say, FairPrice to shop? Because we perceive our risk of getting a head injury from grocery shopping to be very low,"" he said.""Similarly, when there is very little transmission, wearing a face mask is similar to wearing a motorcycle helmet while buying groceries. We need to manage or perceive risk in an objective way.""With a shortage of N95 respirators and surgical masks worldwide, experts believe that every country's priority should be to maintain inventories of such protective equipment for doctors, nurses and first responders.If healthcare workers get infected or die in large numbers, healthcare systems will collapse, causing panic in society.Thus, encouraging the use of masks has to be balanced with the preservation of the limited resource. If three-quarters of the 5.6 million people here use just two surgical masks a day, Singapore will expend more than 58.8 million masks a week.Now, with scientists discovering that pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic infected people might unwittingly spread the virus, the advice on mask-wearing has changed, and people are encouraged to wear a reusable mask in public so as to protect others.Ironically, it has been an uphill task to get everyone to comply, and it has not been hard to spot people without masks in public.LAISSEZ-FAIRE LOCKDOWN?The third issue is whether an earlier and more complete lockdown would have helped Singapore avoid the current situation, where daily Covid-19 cases have breached the 1,000 mark.From the get-go, Singapore has taken a calibrated approach to managing the outbreak, with measures changing as the situation evolved.While testing, contact tracing and quarantining have been a constant, the Government has preferred a proportionate response in implementing safe distancing measures gradually, instead of having a more draconian total lockdown.For some, this calibrated approach, with rules changing on a daily basis, has seemed wishy-washy and confusing.If Singapore had taken a more cut and dried approach, imposed a police-enforced lockdown with curfews and stopped public transport as some countries have done, could it have eradicated the virus?Debate on this topic has intensified as lockdowns take their toll on economies and public life around the world, and countries contemplate the loosening of restrictions to allow some modicum of normal life to resume.Ironically, some commentators were citing Singapore as the model of what a less stringent lockdown might look like. With the surge in numbers now, Singapore is also pointed to as an example of the risks that premature easing up might entail, making it plain that no easy, one-size-fits-all solution exists for this very unusual outbreak.Prof Wilder-Smith believes that for some countries like Singapore and New Zealand, completely locking down is possible and can potentially bring infections to zero.But she added that this would include ringfencing the country from even its own citizens who are overseas and want to return.Also, such a total lockdown would have to be maintained for some time for infections to be kept out, as the world has missed the boat on containment and infections can easily be reintroduced once Singapore opens its borders.""Four weeks ago, I would say every country should go for containment. But worldwide, we have missed that chance,"" Prof Wilder-Smith said. ""If it's one or two weeks, we will all gladly do it. But we don't know how long this situation will last and a total lockdown can mean long-term suffering with very strict restrictions for months and months to come, which also causes major damage.""As for an earlier lockdown, Prof Teo said data in the early days did not justify it.A lockdown reduces physical interaction and helps to break chains of transmission. But with the number of cases spreading in the community in the double digits daily at most, a lockdown would have been akin to using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, bringing unneeded disruption to life when cases could have been controlled through strategies like contact tracing, testing and isolation.Elsewhere, in Wuhan, where the virus had first emerged, and in Italy, one of the worst-hit European countries so far, lockdowns substantially reduced the number of new cases for a time.But experts now agree that it is mostly a delaying tactic, and believe that cases will rebound when the restrictions are lifted.So far, lockdowns are estimated to cost a staggering total of US$7.8 trillion (S$11.2 trillion) worldwide. In Singapore, the economic toll of the current partial lockdown is predicted to be around $10 billion. As people work from home and children stay away from school, there have also been more reports of domestic abuse and mental health issues.After just 15 days of the circuit breaking period in Singapore, there are also signs of ""lockdown fatigue"", with people venturing out and crowding the only places where they are now allowed to visit such as supermarkets and parks.This is why governments around the world have struggled to find the right balance between imposing strict restrictions to resolve the pandemic and not causing irreversible harm to the economy and society.At the same time, for a calibrated approach to work, rules have to be kept simple. For now, caveats and exemptions for mask-wearing and enlisting the help of grandparents for childcare support, for instance, have caused confusion and led to non-compliance.LONG ROAD AHEADIn an interview with CNN on March 29, when asked about Singapore's success, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had cautioned against complacency, pointing to a long road ahead, as other ministers had also done. Indeed, several had said early on that the outbreak could last into 2021, raising some eyebrows at the time.""I hesitate to talk about success because we are right in the midst of a battle which is intensifying,"" said PM Lee. ""With great effort, I think it (Singapore's measures) has helped to keep the number of cases down, but I am under no illusions that we have won. We are just going in, and there is a long battle ahead.""His words have rung true and Singapore is in the news again, this time as a cautionary tale.Harvard University professor of epidemiology Marc Lipsitch, who had praised Singapore's approach in a research paper, said, when asked, that while Singapore has done admirably well in how long it was able to maintain a degree of control while keeping up significant economic activity, he never believed with certainty that the epidemic would be kept under control here.He told The Straits Times: ""But I see the failure of containment after a significant period of time as reflecting the strong challenges of this virus (even more than Sars, for example) rather than the failure of any specific location.""Prof Wilder-Smith said: ""So Singapore looked good three weeks ago and not so now... We should not be too early in making judgments and should maybe wait until the end to compare.""With scientists predicting that lockdowns might have to last until next year, and new information indicating that recovering from the infection may not confer immunity for long, governments will have to be careful about allowing hubris or complacency to set in while a vaccine is being developed.This is yet another fine balancing act.Prof Teo said: ""Definitely we should not be arrogant and we should not be mocking the efforts of other countries... Equally, it does not mean Singapore is arrogant or smug if we share our experiences with other countries.""In a crisis faced by the whole world, sharing those experiences becomes crucially important as a case study of what has worked and what hasn't.""",,2020-04-22 10:23:00,hardwarezone,weighing singapore response pandemicdid singapore overlook give wrong advice mask wearing lax circuit breaker

"SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 287 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday (Apr 9), the largest daily increase so far and more than double yesterday's highest record, the multi-ministry task force dealing with the coronavirus said during a press conference on Thursday (Apr 9).This brings the national tally to 1,910.Of the new cases, 219 are linked to existing clusters, with at least 160 cases linked to the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol.A total of 19 cases are linked to previous cases, with 46 unlinked cases, the task force said. Three of the latest cases announced are imported. 314 cases have been discharged from acute care, and 705 cases have been moved to a community isolation facility, the task force said. Singapore has also seen six fatalities from COVID-19, the task force said. It was reported on Wednesday a 32-year-old Indian national died after taking a swab test, and was confirmed to have COVID-19 after his demise.READ: Day 2 of COVID-19 'circuit breaker' sees more than 3,000 breaches of safe distancing measuresThe task force said that with the help of the police and Ministry of Defence, it established a link between the  cluster at Mustafa Centre shopping mall and the Project Glory construction site as well as a number of foreign worker dormitories: S11 [email protected], Sungei Tengah Lodge, Tampines Dormitory Cochrane Lodge II  and Toh Guan Dormitory. Director of medical services at the Ministry of Health Assoc Prof Kenneth Mak described how some of the dormitory cases were linked to the Mustafa Centre cluster.""We believe that the workers had visited Mustafa and they subsequently transmitted the infection to their co-workers,"" he said.  ""Transmission most likely occurred through close contact,for example at meal times, during breaks, and also between co-workers at work due to physical proximity at work sites,"" he said.Subsequently, they could have spread the infection to colleagues and friends within the dormitories, he added.

""true blue"" singaporeans married to foreign spouses and ""true blue"" singaporean offspring of at least one foreign spouse? will singaporean spouses of prcs and indian nationals and filipinos + their singaporean kids not be disillusioned with their own country if one of their foreign parents constantly has to cop shit (""tiong"", ""cheena"", ""ceca"", ""pinoy"", ""foreign trash"") from the lowest common denominators because of the xenophobia that your manifesto will enable?

perhaps you should consider that hyper-neoliberal economic policies and the lack of proper worker protections in singapore are the real issues at hand - and that foreigners, despite being an easy target, are not responsible for the ills that we face?

2) how do you plan to renegotiate trade agreements with superpowers like china and india when singapore is a small fry with little manoeuvering room and a practically non-existent domestic market? how do you plan to account for the fact that FTA renegotiations are virtually unheard of? if the usa of all countries cannot renego the TPP, what sort of hubris are you filled with to genuinely believe that china and india will waste their time on a small fry like singapore and put our interests first over theirs?

they would sooner cancel the csfta and ceca and destroy our industries and small businesses in the process than give an inch.

"A forum letter published in Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao that links the COVID-19 outbreak in dormitories to the personal hygiene and living habits of foreign workers shows ""underlying racism"", Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said.""I think the letter reveals some underlying racism ... Because it typecasts an entire group - several hundred thousand of them - as lacking in personal hygiene, on the basis of their background, because they all come from backward countries,"" he said in an interview with Lianhe Zaobao on Friday (Apr 17).Mr Shanmugam also said that the letter is xenophobic and deeply insensitive, and reflected a ""lack of understanding of why we have this transmission of COVID-19 amongst our foreign worker population"".Singapore has seen a spike in its number of COVID-19 cases in recent weeks, with the majority of new cases involving foreign workers from dormitories.On Friday, Singapore reported 623 new infections, of which 558 were linked to foreign worker dormitories.Kranji Lodge 1 on Saturday became the 13th foreign worker dormitory to be gazetted an isolation area, meaning residents will have to be quarantined in their rooms.To date, more than 3,200 of Singapore's 5,050 cases are attributed to foreign worker domitories.The forum letter, published on Apr 13, questioned if foreign workers were to be blamed for the rise in cases, pointing to their eating habits and alleged lack of personal hygiene.Mr Shanmugam, however, said that the number of cases at foreign worker dormitories were primarily due to communal living, pointing out that foreign workers live, work and cook together.""Personal habits are extremely important  washing of hands, keeping yourself clean are very important,"" he said.""But when you put people together, when they sleep in the same room, they cook together and they are in close proximity over a long period of time, of course there will be high levels of transmission.""Mr Shanmugam also acknowledged concerns over the living conditions in dormitories, saying that conditions in the newer dormitories were ""quite okay"", while standards in the older ones varied.""As (Manpower) Minister Josephine Teo has said, look, we will fix this up after COVID-19, and we will deal with the older dorms,"" he said.With foreign worker cases expected to continue rising amid aggressive testing, Mr Shanmugam said there is a need to educate people on the reasons.""The circulation is limited, they are in community isolation,"" he said.""The cross-infection from that person to the rest of the community, whether Singaporean or PR, or foreign worker, is extremely minimised through our isolation approaches.""Some people have also expressed concern that foreign domestic workers, because of potential interaction with foreign workers on their days off, could be another group at risk of being infected in large numbers.Current data shows that infection among foreign domestic workers is very low, said Mr Shanmugam.Foreign domestic workers have to comply with circuit breaker measures and must remain in their employers' homes on their rest days.""The evidence so far is that they get the infection from their employers, not from outside,"" he added.Looking at the bigger picture, Mr Shanmugam said Singaporeans have a duty to care for foreign workers and show them empathy, adding that the Government and community have moved to help them.Fifty-seven per cent of Singaporeans have been able to become professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMET) because of foreign workers, he said.""They clean Singapore, they build our HDB flats, they build our buildings, they handle our waste management, they form the base of our economy,"" he added.""And therefore they are helping us build our prosperity.""Mr Shanmugam cautioned Singaporeans against making sweeping statements about foreign workers, even as he acknowledged that racial fault lines run deep.""As Singaporeans, I would say, whether Chinese, Indian or Malay, or Eurasians, others, we are really kind, compassionate, generous people,"" he stated.""We are bigger than the sentiments expressed in that letter.""-12654924huh?

"> # COVID-19: Singapore confirms 876 new cases, total crosses 23,000

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) has confirmed 876 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Sunday (10 May) noon, bringing the total to 23,336.

> Of the cases, 860 are foreign workers living in dormitories, said the ministry. There is one imported case and four cases in the local community.

> There are also five new clusters: a construction site at 15 Serangoon North Avenue 1, a construction site at Tanah Merah Coast Road, 9 Woodlands Industrial Park E1, 11 Woodlands Industrial Park E1 and 515 Yishun Industrial Park A.

> Also, the ministry said that it had recently found that 33 cases from a laboratory were false positives, “due to an apparatus calibration issue for one of its test kits”. This was discovered as a result of its regular reviews of laboratory tests.

> Subsequent retesting at the National Public Health Laboratory confirmed that these were negative cases. “There were no false negative results discovered from our review,” MOH said. “MOH has taken immediate actions to rectify the situation. The laboratory has stopped all tests and is working to resolve the calibration issue.”

> In addition, the ministry said, “There were two results that had been equivocal, and were subsequently verified to be negative upon re-testing.”

> It added that all equivocal results are sent to the National Public Health Laboratory for re-testing. “As a precautionary measure, we had categorised Cases 18669 and 19360 as positive while pending verification, and isolated them.”

> Further epidemiological investigations and contact tracing have uncovered links between previously announced and new cases.

> This includes the five additional cases that are now linked to the cluster at Mustafa Centre (145 Syed Alwi Road), which has a total of 129 confirmed cases currently

> One additional case is linked to the cluster at Acacia Home (30 Admiralty Street), which has a total of 17 confirmed cases now.

> More than 50 clusters linked to foreign worker dormitories have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Tuas View Dormitory and Sungei Tengah Lodge.

> The three are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some 400,000 foreign workers live in dorms here in Singapore.

> 

> A total of 425 more cases of COVID-19 infection have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities. In all, 2,721 have fully recovered from the infection.

> There are currently 1,097 confirmed cases who are still in hospital, with 22 of them in critical condition in the intensive care unit. A total of 19,498 are isolated and cared for at community facilities. These are those who have mild symptoms, or are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19.

> Apart from 20 who have passed away due to COVID-19 complications, six patients who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including a 44-year-old Bangladeshi man who died of a heart attack on Tuesday.

> As of 4 May, the ministry has conducted 175,604 swab tests, of which 123,525 were done on unique individuals.

> This translates to about 30,800 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and around 21,600 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

"Why the PAP has failed14 Feb - there was a foreign worker tested positive for COVID-19 and he was rushed into ICU a day later. 17 Feb - 2 more foreign workers were tested positive for the virus. 18 Feb - it was revealed that they formed a new cluster from a work site.News came out and employers rushed to send their foreign workers, who are unwell, to the hospital for a swab test.19 Feb - MOM published a news article from Mr Kelvin Teoh (divisional director of MOM for foreign workers) that employers must not send the foreign workers to the hospital or they may have their WORK PASS privileges suspended. Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet. The poor foreign workers in numbers of 300,000 became victims of the PAP government, due to their lack of hindsight and that huge stench of arrogance to listen to the public when many threads about the issue was raised in and around mid Feb. To this day, neither did Mr Kelvin Teoh nor Josephine Teo nor PAP Taskforce apologise to Singaporean and the foreign workers.(Saw this comment on fb)Importantly, from 1st Feb 2020 onwards, the instruction ""Do not wear a mask if you are well"" started to be published in the Straits Times daily...

If you close schools, whats the trigger to reopen them?In Singapore, we want life to go on as normal. We want businesses, churches, restaurants and schools to stay open. This is what success looks like. Everything goes forward with modifications as needed, and you keep doing this until theres a vaccine or a treatment.On testing, the threshold for getting a test is pretty low. For the first week, we tested only people from Wuhan or Hubei province, then we tested anyone who had been in China within the last 14 days.By the end of January, all of our public hospitals could do tests. Then we moved to enhanced screening  we tested anyone coming to a hospital with a respiratory illness, anyone who had been in contact with a COVID-19 patient.Now, its even become more liberal. If youre a hospital staff member with a mild cold, well give you a test.But if youre a normal person with no contacts with anybody and mild symptoms, wed just send them home.

"It is a common misconception to think that the Mustafa cluster is some huge means of spreading between dorms. Actually, out of the 87 cases in the cluster, the great majority are Singaporeans.

\#908: 36 yo male Bangladeshi, may be linked to #788 (57 yo SG woman)

\#938: 64 yo male Indian (probably too old to be a dorm resident)

\#1015: 41 yo male Indian

"-to-ta...39249.htmlSINGAPORE — Despite having heightened surveillance and tightened precautions in Singapore’s migrant worker dormitories early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, the measures “turned out to be insufficient”, said Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean on Thursday (11 June).In a 25-minute speech televised on regional broadcaster CNA, Teo pointed out to the novel coronavirus being much more infectious than its genetically-related counterpart, which causes the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).During the 2003 SARS outbreak, Singapore recorded 238 cases of the disease and 33 deaths.In comparison, the city-state has confirmed 39,387 COVID-19 cases, including 25 related fatalities to date. Some 94 per cent of the total are foreign workers living in dorms.“On 25 March, we recorded zero cases in our dormitories. Just 10 days later, on 4 April, when the number increased to 26 cases, we acted decisively to isolate the dormitories,” said Teo, who is also Coordinating Minister for National Security.“However, the infectiousness of this virus and the communal living conditions in the dormitories meant that in a fortnight, by 20 April, we were recording more than 1,000 new cases per day in the dormitories.”While Singapore may have gained experience in tackling the SAR outbreak here, “no two crises are the same”, Teo said. The efforts to fight the COVID-19 outbreak in the migrant worker community is “a major challenge”, he added.On the mobilisation of the Singapore Armed Forces and Home Team to combat the COVID-19 outbreak, Teo pointed out that the task is not a mission that they have been specifically prepared and trained for.“But they demonstrated their readiness and flexibility by stepping up to establish the joint task forces within days, to support their MOM (Ministry of Manpower) and MOH (Ministry of Health) colleagues who were already on the frontlines”, he noted.The taskforces had deployed teams to all the dorms to look after more than 300,000 workers and supported the MOH’s overall medical support plan.Teo reiterated that the authorities are currently testing and clearing every worker living in the dorms to ensure they are well and can safely resume work.“The operations are still ongoing, to bring the dorm situation fully under control. But the number of daily cases has already come down to between a third and half of the peak. About two-thirds of the patients have already fully recovered,” he added.Teo’s delivery is the third in a series of national speeches by cabinet ministers, following the address by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong last Sunday and National Development Lawrence Wong on Tuesday. Minister for Trade and Industry Chan Chun Sing is scheduled next to deliver his speech on Sunday.",,2020-11-06 21:01:00,sgtalk,ta 39249 htmlsingapore despite heightened surveillance tightened precautions singapore early pandemic measures turned insufficient said senior minister teo chee hean thursday 11 june 25 minute speech televised regional broadcaster cna teo pointed novel much infectious genetically related counterpart causes severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 2003 sars outbreak singapore recorded 238 disease 33 deaths comparison city state confirmed 39 387 including 25 related fatalities date 94 per cent total living 25 march recorded zero 10 days later 4 april number increased 26 acted decisively isolate said teo also coordinating minister national security however infectiousness communal living conditions meant fortnight 20 april recording 1 000 new per day singapore may gained experience tackling sar outbreak no two crises teo said efforts fight outbreak community major challenge added mobilisation singapore armed forces home team combat outbreak teo pointed task not mission specifically prepared trained demonstrated readiness flexibility stepping establish joint task forces within days support mom ministry manpower moh ministry health colleagues already frontlines noted taskforces deployed teams look 300 000 supported moh overall medical support plan teo reiterated authorities currently testing clearing every living ensure well safely resume work operations still ongoing bring situation fully control number daily already come third half peak two thirds patients already fully recovered added teo delivery third series national speeches cabinet ministers following address prime minister lee hsien loong last sunday national development lawrence wong tuesday minister trade industry chan chun sing scheduled next deliver speech sunday

"Real change might come out of this situation, but at the expense of lives. It takes an extreme case and a real hazard to public health to get the ministries to force employers and dorm operators to do something. The foreign worker situation was already a ticking time bomb which exploded during the 2013 Little India riot. 

I'm surprised to see that some SGers don't know how little the typical Bangla earns - $17-$18 a day. Yeah, that's a lot back in rural Bangladesh BUT they pay SG prices for food etc and there's the huge payment for the middlemen.

HDB and other developers are reaping in HUGE profits by exploiting these workers. They don't need to invest in safer or more efficient equipment and practices - why rent more machinery when you can get a bunch of Banglas to do the work by hand (literally). Developers don't pass the savings to buyers anyway, so there's nothing to be lost by paying workers more and giving them decent welfare.

In other developed countries (ex the Emirates), construction workers are paid professional wages, have decent working conditions. There's a construction site along my commute (this is pre-lockdown days) and I was struck by the difference between a US site and the SG sites I was used to seeing: There's a much fewer workers, everyone is wearing proper protective gear and workers seem healthy and well-fed!

"> # S'pore must be prepared to pay higher construction costs due to new Covid-19 regulations: Wong

> Everyone in Singapore must be prepared to pay higher costs for construction work in Singapore due to Covid-19 safety measures, says Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong.

> Wong, who jointly heads the Multi-Ministry Taskforce on Covid-19 with Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, said this in a press conference on Friday, May 15, referring to anticipated rises in cost associated with new measures that are being imposed on the construction industry as its workers return to work on critical projects.

> Testing scaled up, construction costs higher

> Wong said that the government intends to test all construction workers who are working every two weeks:

> ""(It) will scale up and we want to test all the workers who are working, who will be resuming work, and it will be done on a regular basis. This will be a new regulatory requirement on top of all the other safe distancing measures that we have put in place that we are talking about, that contractors will now have to uphold, so I have no doubt, as with all regulatory requirements, the principle must be that the company must bear the cost.""

> He added:

> ""So I have no doubt that it will mean construction costs in Singapore will be higher because of these regulatory requirements. And all of us have to be prepared to pay this higher cost, because we want construction work to be done safely in Singapore from henceforth.""

> Workers heading back to construction sites

> Also at the press conference, the Building and Construction Authority (BCA) announced that an additional 20,000 construction workers, constituting about 5 per cent of the construction workforce in Singapore, will be returning to work from June 2 onwards.

> To ensure that all these workers remain healthy and Covid-19-free as far as possible, both large-scale and individual measures will be implemented.

> These include requiring each worker to download the TraceTogether app and wear a mask while working.

> At the worksites, workers must be divided into different teams, minimise interaction with other workers as much as possible, and the sites must also be equipped with sufficient hand wash stations and hand sanitisers.

> The workers must also have dedicated transport to and from their accommodations, if they are not able to live in quarters on-site, which will also be arranged to take into account safe distancing measures and to group workers involved in the same projects together.

"Why the PAP has failed14 Feb - there was a foreign worker tested positive for COVID-19 and he was rushed into ICU a day later. 17 Feb - 2 more foreign workers were tested positive for the virus. 18 Feb - it was revealed that they formed a new cluster from a work site.News came out and employers rushed to send their foreign workers, who are unwell, to the hospital for a swab test.19 Feb - MOM published a news article from Mr Kelvin Teoh (divisional director of MOM for foreign workers) that employers must not send the foreign workers to the hospital or they may have their WORK PASS privileges suspended. Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet. The poor foreign workers in numbers of 300,000 became victims of the PAP government, due to their lack of hindsight and that huge stench of arrogance to listen to the public when many threads about the issue was raised in and around mid Feb.

"> # No Singapore residents among 214 new COVID-19 infections; 3 community cases

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported 214 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Monday (15 June) noon, bringing the total number of cases to 40,818.

> “Based on our investigations so far, there are three cases in the community, all of whom are work pass holders. There are no Singaporean/permanent resident cases,” said the MOH, adding that the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories.

> The ministry said that more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of over 2,700 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Jurong Penjuru Dormitory, and Tuas View Dormitory.

> The four are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas. Some 400,000 such workers live in dorms here in Singapore.

> Some 400,000 such workers live in dorms here in Singapore, of which about 10 per cent have been cleared of the infection, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on 1 June during a press conference.

> Over 20,000 infected foreign workers have recovered, added Teo.

> The story will be updated later at night.

> MOH STATEMENT IN FULL

> With 781 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Sunday, 29,589 cases – some 73 per cent of the total tally – have fully recovered from the infection.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while two are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Over 10,000 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 26 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, 10 others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and another three, including the 44-year-old male Indian national who died on Monday, whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> As of 8 June, the ministry has conducted 488,695 swab tests, of which 284,963 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 85,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 50,000 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

That's why it's just as important to eliminate that hidden pool of virus within our community too... not just the FW dormitory side.

"All these feel good jerking about poor treatment of the migrant workers yet very few people actually think about realistically how can we improve their conditions. Yes their living conditions are terrible, 12-16 people in a single room. Its easy to say oh we should make it 4-6 people in a single room, that they have a better living condition and spaces. 

Who's gonna pay for the additional rooms? Their employers? Certainly they will try their ways to find loopholes. And if it becomes unprofitable for the employers, who will want to dabble in the business. So will the government pay for the upgrades in housing then? Of course not, imagine all the uproars that will be caused.

Ask yourself, will changing the dormitories to having 4-6 people in a single room have a impact of slowing down the covid 19 ? I don't think so.

“The foreign worker levy, commonly known as “levy”, is a pricing mechanism to regulate the number of foreign workers in Singapore.” 

If it was meant to regulate - it should be very clear we have too many to support medically without taking a toll on our healthcare system.

It always depends on the circumstance imo. Cb should only be lifted if there isnt local transmission for like a coupld of weeks. There should be some form of plan put in place but even then travel should be restricted. Maybe start going back to work after a month of low/closs to zero cases etc. But if there is a sudden spike then maybe go back to the measures.

"Way back in January, opposition strategy leader Alex Tan zhixiang correctly predicted that foreign workers will be the weakest link in Singapore.  Alex also correctly pointed out the fake news by the government like People's Association claiming the virus will not spread in crowded places, the shortage of N95 face masks, the imminent border closure and the eventual shortage of essential goods in Singapore.Alex was also the first one who wrote that not wearing a face mask in public is going to be catastrophic, and even called Lee Hsien Loong a fool, and his WHO adviser Dale Fisher a Trojan Horse for issuing the advice.Alex also repeatedly warned that local transmission is out of control, and nobody listened. Is Alex claiming credits? Well, Alex is just giving credits where it is due. Alex did hit all the right buttons after all.For today's chaos, Alex still has solutions. Again, Alex will reveal them only when it is too late.Why? Because  Alex is not a MP or a Minister.

"This is a very good piece by TWC2. The whole economic doctrine need to change in SG with regards to cheap labour.

Beside the pure dignity and human rights argument I think from my observations there is no point with cheap labour. I think it damages SG. There is this idea that oh if we increase the salaries and working conditions our HDB will be more expensive etc. I dont think thats the case. How much do we even know about the man-hours spent on an HDB? How many hours is productive skilled hours? What about inefficiencies?

The addiction to cheap labour drives inefficiencies and unproductivity. Most bosses just throws more workers at the problem instead of thinking how can i solve this better this time and next time. Skills dont buildup because the workers change all the time. Workers dont have the loyalty and pride in their work. These bosses are not thinking at all how do i upskill my workforce, what machines or workprocesses should i improve etc.

In a previous job i was working with shipyards. Contracts for construction of oilrigs was basically a competition between South Korea and Singapore. 
The contract amounts was only marginally cheaper in SG than South Korea. In the end South Korea got far more projects and expanded far more than SG. It was estimate that SG spent 2-3x the manhours for the same project.

On a new construction project in an SG shipyard it’s common to see up to a thousand workers onboard at any given time by numerous different subcontractors doing their own thing. Bruteforce with lots of workers to get things done.

Going to an South Korean yard you dont see even a fifth of the workers onboard and vast majority is employees of the shipyard. Why? One reason is they thought heavily about making ship-parts modular that can be made separately without clash of workers. Main reason they had that system was the south koreans has prided themselves in competence of what they do, invested in technology and so forth. A good skilled worker also gets paid more. A skilled worker moves to improve ones worktask etc etc. Its an continuous improvement process.

Cheap labour may have had its benefit in the early days of rapid expansion of SG. But its now incredibly outdated. Productivity improvements are minimal. Why pay 1500/month(incl levies etc) for unproductive worker when we can have good skilled workers for say 2500-3000+/month. With good work conditions, technology and pay also locals will do this work same as in other countries without cheap labour.",,2020-05-03 16:33:40,reddit,good piece twc2 whole economic doctrine need change sg regards cheap labour beside pure dignity human rights argument think observations no point cheap labour think damages sg idea oh increase salaries working conditions hdb expensive etc dont think thats case much even know man hours spent hdb many hours productive skilled hours inefficiencies addiction cheap labour drives inefficiencies unproductivity bosses throws problem instead thinking solve better time next time skills dont buildup change time dont loyalty pride work bosses not thinking upskill workforce machines workprocesses should improve etc previous job working shipyards contracts construction oilrigs basically competition south korea singapore contract amounts marginally cheaper sg south korea end south korea got far projects expanded far sg estimate sg spent 2 3x manhours project new construction project sg shipyard common see thousand onboard given time numerous different subcontractors thing bruteforce lots get things done going south korean yard dont see even fifth onboard vast majority employees shipyard one reason thought heavily making ship parts modular made separately without clash main reason system south koreans prided competence invested technology forth good skilled also gets paid skilled moves improve ones worktask etc etc continuous improvement process cheap labour may benefit early days rapid expansion sg incredibly outdated productivity improvements minimal pay 1500 month incl levies etc unproductive good skilled say 2500 3000 month good work conditions technology pay also locals work countries without cheap labour

"Why the PAP has failed14 Feb - there was a foreign worker tested positive for COVID-19 and he was rushed into ICU a day later. 17 Feb - 2 more foreign workers were tested positive for the virus. 18 Feb - it was revealed that they formed a new cluster from a work site.News came out and employers rushed to send their foreign workers, who are unwell, to the hospital for a swab test.19 Feb - MOM published a news article from Mr Kelvin Teoh (divisional director of MOM for foreign workers) that employers must not send the foreign workers to the hospital or they may have their WORK PASS privileges suspended. Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet. The poor foreign workers in numbers of 300,000 became victims of the PAP government, due to their lack of hindsight and that huge stench of arrogance to listen to the public when many threads about the issue was raised in and around mid Feb. To this day, neither did Mr Kelvin Teoh nor Josephine Teo nor PAP Taskforce apologise to Singaporean and the foreign workers.(Saw this comment on fb)This should be a sticky buddy. This facts in this post are clear and presented well. Josephine who is representative of MOM and LW of the Taskforce must come out to apologise to the public on this saga.

"This is my take and analysis on the current situation. The measures we have implemented seem to be working, local cases (outside of foreign workers, worker dormitories and living quarters) are going down. We can confirm that home space/living density is one of the key contributory factors for the spread of COVID-19 despite heat/humidity being a key deterrent. The Singapore government should start to do the same segmentation procedures to test, separate, space out and relocate all foreign workers if necessary for all remaining foreign dormitories and living quarters which are not isolated currently. This needs to be done now, proactively and aggressively. Singapore’s problem is unique due to our high dependence and reliance on foreign workers. In order to resolve the issue of the spread of COVID-19 in Singapore, stopping the spread of this virus in the foreign quarter dormitories and living quarters is the paramount key. I hope the authorities have already realise this and are putting in place, proactive and aggressive measures to stop COVID-19 from spreading amongst all cramped quarters in Singapore. We solve this, we will solve 90% of the COVID-19 cases and the spread of in Singapore. If we fail to do so, there is a high chance that the virus will reactivate it again for a third wave even if there is a drop of COVID-19 cases initially and the next few weeks. We have to remember that it is likely that the virus could have been circulating in the foreign dormitories as early as February, reaching the stage it has today.",,2020-04-13 12:48:00,hardwarezone,take analysis current situation measures implemented seem working local outside living quarters going confirm home space living density one key contributory factors spread despite heat humidity key deterrent singapore government should start segmentation procedures test separate space relocate necessary remaining living quarters not isolated currently needs done proactively aggressively singapore problem unique due high dependence reliance order resolve issue spread singapore stopping spread quarter living quarters paramount key hope authorities already realise putting place proactive aggressive measures stop spreading amongst cramped quarters singapore solve solve 90 spread singapore fail high chance reactivate third wave even drop initially next weeks remember likely could circulating early february reaching stage today

An earlier lockdown would have prevented this transmission, but it was unreasonable to lockdown in February

However, on March 26, a person from Dorm B met a person from Dorm C at an non-essential construction site. The person from Dorm B passed the virus to the person from Dorm C. The residents of Dorm C thus became infected. In this case, had we locked down sometime earlier in March, we would have prevented the transmission of the virus from Dorm B to Dorm C.

Its not like all the dorms are next to each other, and its not like all dorms in Singapore are affected by this virus. An earlier lockdown would have prevented cross-spreading between different dormitories. Unfortunately, we did not lock down earlier, which is why we see so many dormitories affected by coronavirus right now",,2020-04-17 01:22:23,reddit,believe earlier lockdown would prevented spreading well let say three b c february person met someone b mustafa person passed person b residents b thus became infected earlier lockdown would prevented transmission unreasonable lockdown february however march 26 person b met person c non essential construction site person b passed person c residents c thus became infected case locked sometime earlier march would prevented transmission b c not like next not like singapore affected earlier lockdown would prevented cross spreading different unfortunately not lock earlier see many affected right

"When was the last time you mingled with one of those FWs or had an overnight chalet stay in their dorms? Probably never. Most locals never mingle with them. Let's call a spade a spade please: they have never been considered part of the community. I don't see why this fact should trigger anyone. Which is why even though for decades their living conditions have not been great, nothing has been done because no one cares enough about it. You probably didn't give a fuck. This is not some fantasy world where people living in a same country automatically become a single community filled with friendship and love and respect and rainbows.

But you miss the objective in splitting the data set. It's useful to segregate the data because a vast majority of the transmissions were within their dorms which you have never stepped a foot into your whole life. Among people you didn't care existed until recently. [Among already isolated clusters.](-19/advisory-on-salary-payment-to-foreign-workers)

You then say, oh but they are free to go to my shopping malls and parks and what not. So rising transmission cases in FWs must then imply rising cases among the rest of the SG community right? But the data isn't showing that. There is no proportional spike. We had seen a proportional spike when thousands of people came back from overseas back to their families.

You will then say, oh but that's because they are testing FWs more and not testing locals enough. But that assumes that suddenly we are testing locals less, which is false. We have also had some of the highest per capita tests conducted even before the FW cases exploded. The extremely low death rates also suggests that the reported cases are a lot closer to the actual, so there is little evidence of the high undetected levels of community spread that fearmongers are postulating.

"Very well said. 
Life & work has taken me to many places, In the 80's I was in construction mixing with the likes of Thai's & Philipines. Their accomodation would be the actual HDB flats or carpark or posh apartments they were building.Cooking facilities were whatever were around at that time.Domestic maids were from the same countries.Weekends were usually a bit chaotic & fights were a common thing.
Then I did a bit of off shore works (Seraya island ) & by this time the likes of Bangladeshis Indians Myanmars have joined the workforce. Their accomodation is a bit better (purpose built dormitories)but the employer still had to make suprise check up on lodgings as this would make sure they play their part at keeping it up to standard.
Dont forget these guys usually work long hours & tidying up their lodgings is last thing they want to do.They usually save the housekeeping for the weekends but then social avtivities needs to happen on weekends.

So I have witnesssed a steady rise of standard but no doubt more needs to be done. Singapore being a small place n so much fast pace to the one that they are used to doesn't help the situation

This is the reality of the world we live in. And if you think PAP would give us a cost breakdown, dream on.

-1045089?amp交流站：疫情时期不做无谓指责2020年4月13日Â*3:30 AM文/黎仕婉作者质疑：“客工宿舍病例大增，难道客工本身没有责任吗？”（档案照片）我记得小时候，我们一家人住在一间小小的政府组屋。空间虽狭小，却也收拾得井井有条。父母教导我们如何收拾整理，如何打扫卫生。我们几个兄弟姐妹还能把一个小小的窝，布置成温馨美丽的家。生活习惯和个人素养是从小养成的，看看现在那些在帮佣手下长大的孩子，有不少就是饭来张口衣来伸手，会做家务和打扫卫生吗？不会，因为生活没有教会他们。在新加坡工作的外国人，其中一些是派驻新加坡的高层人员，另一些是从事建筑和环境卫生等工作比较辛苦的外籍工人，有不少来自较落后的国家。他们离乡背井到外地谋生，生活习惯会伴随他们，比如用手抓饭吃、在树下和草地上纳凉、聚在一起喝酒聊天等等。在乡下生活的人，可能对蟑螂壁虎这些昆虫习以为常；城市人看到这些都会吓得尖叫。日前看到报道，一名前高官在面簿贴文说，新加坡以第三世界的态度对待客工，提到政府“允许”雇主让客工坐在罗厘车斗里，让客工如沙丁鱼般挤在狭小的宿舍里，宿舍卫生条件非常恶劣等等；看到客工坐在地上用餐他非常生气，看到客工疲倦时直接躺在地上他不开心。言下之意，新加坡并没有好好地对待这些客工。客工有聚一起吃饭聊天的习惯，有时在组屋底层用餐后，铺一张纸皮倒头就休息。只要不打扰其他人，大家也习惯了，相安无事。但我有时看到他们把饭盒和饮料罐子丢在一旁，造成环境污染很不好。确实，我们有做不好的地方，但我们也看到政府一直在改进。宿舍有床有风扇有柜子，还有娱乐设备，基本设施都提供了。重要的是，还有客服中心和义工帮忙解决问题。一名从事建筑业10年的人在上述贴文留言说，客工的居住环境已改变不少。新建的这些宿舍，床架、床褥和柜子都是新的，床位也是按房间面积安排的，符合当局规定的标准。另外，宿舍也聘请管理人员打扫卫生。关键是，住在宿舍里的客工是否尽本分？个人卫生到不到位？用了厨房有没有收拾并丢掉厨余？用完厕所是否有保持干净？如果只是依赖清洁工人打扫，宿舍是不可能干净卫生的。个人卫生习惯如果没有改过来，去到哪里都一样。有一个朋友曾出租房子给客工，两年后拿回房子时吓了一跳。厨房、柜子、沙发等都有蟑螂的足迹。朋友后来只好请灭虫公司将整间房子彻底消毒一遍。即便做到这一步，他还是让那房子空了两年，最后卖掉。指责和批评是极其容易的事。客工宿舍病例大增，难道客工本身没有责任吗？喜欢聚集和不注重个人卫生不也是原因吗？与其指责政府，不如负起个人责任。没有一个政府能将抗疫做到滴水不漏，新加坡政府已经做得很到位了。,,2020-04-18 14:04:00,hardwarezone,1045089 amp交流站 疫情时期不做无谓指责2020年4月13日â 3 30 am文 黎仕婉 作者质疑 客工宿舍病例大增 难道客工本身没有责任吗 档案照片 我记得小时候 我们一家人住在一间小小的政府组屋 空间虽狭小 却也收拾得井井有条 父母教导我们如何收拾整理 如何打扫卫生 我们几个兄弟姐妹还能把一个小小的窝 布置成温馨美丽的家 生活习惯和个人素养是从小养成的 看看现在那些在帮佣手下长大的孩子 有不少就是饭来张口衣来伸手 会做家务和打扫卫生吗 不会 因为生活没有教会他们 在新加坡工作的外国人 其中一些是派驻新加坡的高层人员 另一些是从事建筑和环境卫生等工作比较辛苦的外籍工人 有不少来自较落后的国家 他们离乡背井到外地谋生 生活习惯会伴随他们 比如用手抓饭吃 在树下和草地上纳凉 聚在一起喝酒聊天等等 在乡下生活的人 可能对蟑螂壁虎这些昆虫习以为常 城市人看到这些都会吓得尖叫 日前看到报道 一名前高官在面簿贴文说 新加坡以第三世界的态度对待客工 提到政府 允许 雇主让客工坐在罗厘车斗里 让客工如沙丁鱼般挤在狭小的宿舍里 宿舍卫生条件非常恶劣等等 看到客工坐在地上用餐他非常生气 看到客工疲倦时直接躺在地上他不开心 言下之意 新加坡并没有好好地对待这些客工 客工有聚一起吃饭聊天的习惯 有时在组屋底层用餐后 铺一张纸皮倒头就休息 只要不打扰其他人 大家也习惯了 相安无事 但我有时看到他们把饭盒和饮料罐子丢在一旁 造成环境污染很不好 确实 我们有做不好的地方 但我们也看到政府一直在改进 宿舍有床有风扇有柜子 还有娱乐设备 基本设施都提供了 重要的是 还有客服中心和义工帮忙解决问题 一名从事建筑业10年的人在上述贴文留言说 客工的居住环境已改变不少 新建的这些宿舍 床架 床褥和柜子都是新的 床位也是按房间面积安排的 符合当局规定的标准 另外 宿舍也聘请管理人员打扫卫生 关键是 住在宿舍里的客工是否尽本分 个人卫生到不到位 用了厨房有没有收拾并丢掉厨余 用完厕所是否有保持干净 如果只是依赖清洁工人打扫 宿舍是不可能干净卫生的 个人卫生习惯如果没有改过来 去到哪里都一样 有一个朋友曾出租房子给客工 两年后拿回房子时吓了一跳 厨房 柜子 沙发等都有蟑螂的足迹 朋友后来只好请灭虫公司将整间房子彻底消毒一遍 即便做到这一步 他还是让那房子空了两年 最后卖掉 指责和批评是极其容易的事 客工宿舍病例大增 难道客工本身没有责任吗 喜欢聚集和不注重个人卫生不也是原因吗 与其指责政府 不如负起个人责任 没有一个政府能将抗疫做到滴水不漏 新加坡政府已经做得很到位了

"> # 7 community cases amongst 451 new COVID-19 infections in Singapore; total close to 39,000

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) reported a preliminary 451 new COVID-19 cases in Singapore as of Wednesday (10 June) noon, bringing the total to 38,965.

> “Based on our investigations so far, there are seven cases in the community, of whom three are Singaporeans/permanent residents and four are work pass holders.,” said the MOH, adding that the vast majority are foreign workers living in dormitories.

> The ministry said more details will be provided in its press release issued at night.

> Dozens of clusters linked to foreign worker dorms have been identified thus far, including Singapore’s largest cluster of over 2,700 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol, followed by Sungei Tengah Lodge, Jurong Penjuru Dormitory, and Tuas View Dormitory.

> The four are among the 25 dorms that have been gazetted as isolation areas.

> Some 400,000 such workers live in dorms here in Singapore, of which about 10 per cent have been cleared of the infection, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on 1 June during a press conference.

> Over 20,000 infected foreign workers have recovered, added Teo.

> The story will be updated later at night.

> MOH STATEMENT IN FULL

> On Tuesday, the ministry added one more public place to a list of locations – first published on 25 May – visited by infectious cases in the community for over 30 minutes.

> Hougang Green Shopping Mall at 21 Hougang Street 51 was visited on 3 June from 12pm to 1pm.

> The list – which excludes residences, workplaces, healthcare facilities, and public transport – will be updated on a rolling 14-day basis or one incubation period.

> With 509 more patients discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities on Tuesday, 25,877 cases – 71.5 per cent of the total tally – have fully recovered from the infection.

> Most of the hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while three are in critical condition in the intensive care unit.

> Over 12,300 patients with mild symptoms or are clinically well but still test positive are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Apart from 25 patients who have died from COVID-19 complications, nine others who tested positive for the virus have died from unrelated causes, including three whose deaths were attributed to a heart attack and two whose deaths were attributed to coronary heart disease.

> “Only cases where the attending doctor or pathologist attributes the primary or underlying cause of death as due to COVID-19 infection will be added to the COVID-19 death count,” said the MOH in previous press releases, adding that the method of assessment is consistent with international practices for classifying deaths.

> As of 1 June, the ministry has conducted 408,495 swab tests, of which 264,393 were done on unique individuals. This translates to around 71,700 swabs conducted per 1 million total population, and about 46,400 unique individuals swabbed per 1 million total population.

Redistribution of wealth promises equality, but it always comes in the form of equality of poverty. See literally every communist country. Also, if the wages were that close together, then your part-time cleaner who cleans the office would be earning close to what your median office worker who spent 25 years in education would.

"-highligh...er-dormitories5TH APR 2020    The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) had issued advisories on enhanced precautionary measures in dormitories to minimise the risk of COVID-19 transmission. However transmissions within foreign worker dormitories have continued to rise and we are seeing more confirmed cases and workers who are ill. The S11 Dormitory @ Punggol (2 Seletar North Link) and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory (18 Toh Guan Road East) are of particular concern.2.    The Multi-Ministry Taskforce has decided that further measures are necessary to contain the risk of further transmission among the foreign workers within these two dormitories. This would keep the workers safe, as well as protect the wider community from widespread transmission from these clusters. Both S11 Dormitory @ Punggol and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory have been declared as isolation areas. Onsite medical support has been deployed, along with provision of food and essential supplies.Measures to contain further outbreak3.    The S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, with 13,000 resident workers, and Westlite Toh Guan dormitory, with 6,800 resident workers, have been gazetted as isolation areas. Given the rising number of confirmed cases, this is necessary to avoid the risk of further transmissions from any potentially infected workers to others in the dormitories, as well as into the community. Workers who are symptomatic have already been isolated.4.    Within these two dormitories, precautionary steps have also been taken to protect workers who are well. All the affected workers will not go to work. Access to recreational facilities will be regulated to reduce the inter-mixing of workers. Movement between blocks is prohibited. Workers have also been advised to cease social interactions with others who do not reside in the same room or floor.5.    MOM is working closely with all dormitory operators, to implement similar measures within their premises with immediate effect. Efforts are also underway in the larger dormitories to reduce the density of their resident workers, by transferring some among them to alternative accommodation during this period.Support provided to workers6.    The workers will continue to be paid their salaries for the duration of the quarantine. Their period of absence from work is treated as paid hospitalisation leave as part of the workers leave eligibility under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA). Their employers are eligible to claim for the $100 daily quarantine allowance.7.    Arrangements will be made to cater three meals a day for all affected workers for the duration of the quarantine. They will also be issued with reusable masks, surgical masks, thermometers, hand sanitisers and other essentials so they can keep themselves safe and comfortable.8.    Onsite medical support has been deployed to support the workers residing at both dormitories. The dormitories have also implemented enhanced health screening measures, such as requiring workers to check and report their temperature twice daily, as well as the regular monitoring for fever and respiratory symptoms. Those who are unwell will be isolated and will be assessed by medical personnel for further attention. Support provided to companies with affected workers9.    Companies that are providing essential services with workers affected by this quarantine order will be supported and arrangements will be made to ensure these essential services can continue to be provided.Advisory to dormitory operators10.   Dormitory operators and workers living in dormitories are reminded of the importance of maintaining high standards of hygiene and cleanliness to safeguard their own health and those of others who are living in the same space. Safe distancing measures must be strictly adhered to. These include measures such as no inter-mixing of workers between dormitory blocks and floors, and for workers to stay within their rooms and to minimise interactions.11.   Social responsibility is critical in slowing the transmission of the virus. We need every individual to play their part in the fight against the virus. Those who are unwell, even with mild flu-like symptoms, should not be at work. They must see a doctor immediately to prevent spreading illness to others.MINISTRY OF HEALTH & MINISTRY OF MANPOWER5 APRIL 2020",,2020-05-04 19:51:00,hardwarezone,highligh er dormitories5th apr 2020 ministry manpower mom issued advisories enhanced precautionary measures minimise risk transmission however transmissions within continued rise seeing confirmed ill s11 punggol 2 seletar north link westlite toh guan 18 toh guan road east particular concern 2 multi ministry taskforce decided measures necessary contain risk transmission among within two would keep safe well protect wider community widespread transmission clusters s11 punggol westlite toh guan declared isolation areas onsite medical support deployed along provision food essential supplies measures contain outbreak3 s11 punggol 13 000 resident westlite toh guan 6 800 resident gazetted isolation areas given rising number confirmed necessary avoid risk transmissions potentially infected others well community symptomatic already isolated 4 within two precautionary steps also taken protect well affected not go work access recreational facilities regulated reduce inter mixing movement blocks prohibited also advised cease social interactions others not reside room floor 5 mom working closely operators implement similar measures within premises immediate effect efforts also underway larger reduce density resident transferring among alternative accommodation period support provided workers6 continue paid salaries duration quarantine period absence work treated paid hospitalisation leave part leave eligibility employment manpower act efma employers eligible claim 100 daily quarantine allowance 7 arrangements made cater three meals day affected duration quarantine also issued reusable masks surgical masks thermometers hand sanitisers essentials keep safe comfortable 8 onsite medical support deployed support residing also implemented enhanced health screening measures requiring check report temperature twice daily well regular monitoring fever respiratory symptoms unwell isolated assessed medical personnel attention support provided companies affected workers9 companies providing essential services affected quarantine order supported arrangements made ensure essential services continue provided advisory operators10 operators living reminded importance maintaining high standards hygiene cleanliness safeguard health others living space safe distancing measures must strictly adhered include measures no inter mixing blocks floors stay within rooms minimise interactions 11 social responsibility critical slowing transmission need every individual play part fight against unwell even mild flu like symptoms should not work must see doctor immediately prevent spreading illness others ministry health ministry manpower5 april 2020

"The foreign worker has rented one bed and maybe one locker. He is responsible for keeping his bed and the area around it clean. 

If the toilet breaks down, you complain to the landlord and the landlord fixes it. But if a foreign worker complains about a broken toilet, and the dorm operator does nothing, do you think the workers know who to report to, how to file small claims tribunal? No, they just have to live with it. If a foreign worker gets moved into a room infested with cockroaches, he can try to keep his own bed area clean, and to convince his roommates to do the same, but if some of the roommates don't cooperate, what can he do? In a normal flat rental, if you trash the place, the landlord will keep your security deposit and fix up the place after you move out, maybe even give the place a new coat of paint to attract a new tenant. If a dirty dorm resident moves out, the dorm operator can just put a new guy into his bed. Because the work permit holders have no choice in where they live. The employers find the cheapest lodgings and assign their workers to go live there.

"The coronavirus crisis has shone a light on the plight of foreign workers and their unique challenges, including the need to keep their families back home financially secure. One worker has managed to resolve that issue with a mobile app while helping his fellow workers stay infection-free. Read more at straitstimes.com. -freeMr Ganesan Muruganandam stands out among the 323,000 migrant workers in dormitories for his heroic efforts in saving his colleagues from the misery of the coronavirus infection.While infection rates among migrant workers in dormitories soar, accounting for about 90 per cent of Singapore’s confirmed cases as of Sunday (May 17), the company-owned dorm he shares with his colleagues has maintained a remarkable slate of zero infections, thanks to his early efforts.When China reported its first few cases of Covid-19 last December, the workplace safety and health coordinator seized the initiative to stay updated with the latest news reports, Ministry of Manpower bulletins, and other reliable online sources that were reporting on the coronavirus.As a safety coordinator, I have to brief my workers and supervisors on the necessary precautions that they should take every day. So I had to figure out what was going on,” explains the 32-year-old.After some research, he recommended that the home improvement company he works at adopt safety measures such as daily temperature checks, safe distancing, wearing masks and encouraging good personal hygiene habits to prevent the spread of the virus.The company acted on his advice as early as Jan 28. A representative from the company has confirmed that there have been zero infections among their workers to date.Ganesan must be appointed to be Overall In charge of All FW dormitory... This example proven prevention of covid virus in FW dormitory is not impossible. And within current dorms structure. All it takes is Good dormitory operation management of good hygiene. Ganesan did it without spending multi million $$$$$$$$$ that will increase our construction cost.Like with LW predicted, cost of building will goes up!...  And this Good example also proven the rest of FW dormitory in which badly affected are extremely lacking in their daily Operation Management with regards to health and hygiene. I strongly recommend MOM or Josephine personally sit down with Ganesan and learn from his experience. ZERO COVID 19 CASE IN FW DORMITORY..WOW.   Josephine really need to investigate the reason why Ganesan can do it. And WHY OTHER DORMITORY CANNOT?.  Ganesan alone saved SG millions of $$$$$.While the rest of FW Dormitories wasted billion of $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$ for SG...

"It is to paint a more realistic picture of what is going on in SG. Workers’ dormitories have been gazetted as isolation places so migrant workers are not coming out to the community. We still can. Like initially the cruise ship off of Japan wasn’t even counted into Japan’s infection count. Is it discriminatory? No cause it makes sense as everything is happening in the cruise ship. There is a clear and distinct separation. Would you rather have 100 unlinked cases popping in the community or 100 linked cases in the community? Both adds the same number to the country’s case tally but they show a different picture all together. The last thing the government want to do is to cause chaos. Many older generations do not follow the news properly and might also misinterpret the information. If you don’t distinguish the cases, the 900+ cases will see people rushing to supermarkets right now, stocking up on everything. They might also speculate and spread fake news everywhere.

">Are you telling me a gov filled with scholars could not have known that the dorms were the best breeding ground for the virus DESPITE repeated warnings from other organisations?

1) They didn't know of the risk.

2) They are unaware of the conditions at the dorm that would increase said risk.

3) They knew but didn't care or weren't proactive enough to take preventive measures.

I'm really not sure which is worse, but none of the excuses are justifiable.

>“There was a very specific reason we built these dormitories. They were designed for communal living, where the workers could live together, socialise with their friends, prepare meals they liked, practice their religious beliefs... It’s a supportive environment for the workers,” said Teo.

>In terms of living conditions, she described workers’ shared rooms as being about the size of half a badminton court accommodating five bunk beds, with “another 20 per cent for circulation space”.

>Such dormitories are also managed by professional operators, which are regulated.

>“Among other things, they have the responsibility to ensure modern sanitation and no over-crowding,” said Teo.

>Around 1,200 factory-converted dormitories across the island house about 95,000 workers. These facilities tend to be smaller and house about 50 to 100 workers each, although some can take in around 500.

>These dormitories may be operated by the employers themselves or by professional firms, and are also regulated to ensure they meet standards for space, hygiene, and fire safety among others.

Masks and social distancing etc will still be maintained and enforced with fines whenever caught.The problem with lockdowns is that govs all over the world (except probably China) have no exit strategy. Malaysia is a good example.....Well, personally for me, I would want zero cases for 2 weeks before lifting the lockdown.But I am not an epidemiologist. So I will defer condition parameter settings for lifting a lockdown to trained professional epidemiologists with no political bias/obligations. Disease outbreaks are not new in human history. Surely WHO or CDC or whatever have protocols on when a disease outbreak can be deemed as contained/eradicated/resolved etc.No such thing as no exit strategy since the final aim for any country is simply to have no more cases. Its just that this kind of things, politicians will not want to discuss openly with the public. Don't dare to jinx, don't want to over commit. Ditto for doctors/epidemiologists.No. No such thing as half lifting, letting majority of people go back to work after May 4th. Do things cannot half-fark, like this half-fark SG lockdown. Only today then say wear masks ish now mandatory. If PAP never say must wear masks, still will have some cockanadons refuse to wear, just cause they don't want to.Even today, mandatory mask wearing, they still allow for exceptions eg no need to wear masks for duration of exercise. After exercise, must mask on. Simi sai. Just ban exercise. People really want to keep fit, jolly well do static station training at home. Cannot run outside, just do high intensity cardio workout at home cannot meh?So just to go back to the original point of when to lift a lockdown, its not hard at all to update pre-existing exit protocols for disease outbreaks for this Wuhan Coronavirus. Other than that, all efforts should be focused on ensuring this virus is eradicated. Of course, if exit conditions are never met for a long time, then have to see how then. But no country barring China is yet at that stage.Even now, China also never say everything ok liao after lifting their lockdown(s). Their obvious fear is that there could be imported cases if China just fully opens its doors and resumes normal operations. Then China will headache again.For SG, being so densely populated, easy for infections to sexplode, but also easier to contain, cos small area mah. Because of that, SG should be able to lift lockdown earlier than other countries even though SG entered lockdown phase much later. But also, since small area means its probably easier for re-infections to occur, PAP cannot afford to ramp down the seriousness in its messaging about Wuhan Coronavirus. Otherwise, people will become complacent again, setting the conditions for possible re-infection wave.",,2020-04-14 23:27:00,hardwarezone,see logic definition contained thinking along lines gov letting majority population resume work 4 may exception businesses require bangla masks social distancing etc still maintained enforced fines whenever caught problem lockdowns govs world except probably china no exit strategy malaysia good example well personally would want zero 2 weeks lifting lockdown not epidemiologist defer condition parameter settings lifting lockdown trained professional epidemiologists no political bias obligations disease outbreaks not new human history surely cdc whatever protocols disease outbreak deemed contained eradicated resolved etc no thing no exit strategy since final aim country simply no kind things politicians not want discuss openly public dare jinx want commit ditto doctors epidemiologists no no thing half lifting letting majority people go back work may 4th things cannot half fark like half fark sg lockdown today say wear masks ish mandatory pap never say must wear masks still cockanadons refuse wear cause want even today mandatory mask wearing still allow exceptions eg no need wear masks duration exercise exercise must mask simi sai ban exercise people really want keep fit jolly well static station training home cannot run outside high intensity cardio workout home cannot meh go back original point lift lockdown not hard update pre existing exit protocols disease outbreaks wuhan efforts should focused ensuring eradicated course exit conditions never met long time see no country barring china yet stage even china also never say everything ok lifting lockdown obvious fear could imported china fully opens doors resumes normal operations china headache sg densely populated easy infections sexplode also easier contain cos small area mah sg should able lift lockdown earlier countries even though sg entered lockdown phase much later also since small area means probably easier infections occur pap cannot afford ramp seriousness messaging wuhan otherwise people become complacent setting conditions possible infection wave

"> # COVID-19: Singapore confirms record 728 new cases, majority linked; total at 4,427

> SINGAPORE — The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Thursday (16 April) reported a record 728 more COVID-19 cases in Singapore – a 62 per cent jump from the previous daily high – taking its total to 4,427.

> The announcement also marks the seventh consecutive day with no imported cases and comes one day after the city-state reported 447 new cases.

> MORE TO COME

> The MOH on Thursday also confirmed that 31 more patients have been discharged from hospitals or community isolation facilities, bringing the total of recovered cases to 683.

> On Wednesday, most of the 1,496 hospitalised cases are stable or improving, while 26 are in critical condition in the intensive care unit, down from 28 on Tuesday.

> A total of 1,540 cases who are clinically well but still test positive for COVID-19 are isolated and cared for at community facilities.

> Ten have died from complications due to COVID-19 infection, including a 70-year-old Singaporean man on Tuesday.

> Another two patients, who tested positive for the virus, have died from causes unrelated to COVID-19.

> At least 23 clusters linked to foreign worker dormitories have been identified thus far, including the largest cluster of 797 cases linked to S11 Dormitory@Punggol.

> As of Tuesday noon, the MOH said it has identified 30,646 close contacts who have been quarantined. Of these, 12,797 are currently quarantined, and 17,849 have completed their quarantine.

> In the MOH’s latest daily situation report, 7,700 of 65,300 issued stay-home notices remain active.

> The COVID-19 Temporary Measures Act, passed in Parliament last Tuesday, gives authorities the power to ban events and gatherings, or impose conditions on how they are conducted, during the “circuit breaker” period from 7 April to 4 May.

> Those caught flouting the enhanced safe distancing measures for the first time will be given a composition fine of $300, and a $1,000 fine for the second time.

> Egregious cases will be prosecuted in court. A first-time offender who is prosecuted under the Act can face a maximum fine of $10,000, or a jail term of up to six months, or both. A second-time or subsequent offender can face a maximum fine of $20,000, or a jail term of up to a year, or both.

> On Tuesday, authorities said that mask-wearing while going out would be mandatory and offenders will face similar penalties. Exceptions to the rule include children under the age of 2, individuals who are excused from wearing masks on medical grounds, and those doing strenuous exercise.

> People who flout their five-day medical leave or stay-home notices are also subjected to similar penalties.

> Part of the “circuit breaker” measures – announced by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on 3 April – include the closure of schools and most workplaces. Only essential services like food establishments, markets and supermarkets, transport, and key banking services will remain open during the month-long closure.

> In a Good Friday address last week, Lee reiterated his call for Singaporeans to stay home, as COVID-19 cases continue to rise in foreign worker dormitories as well as in the general population.

> Over the weekend, the authorities issued a slew of measures, including the closure of beaches, facilities in parks and gardens and playfields.

> Stadiums have also been closed, while parents are not allowed to drop off their children with grandparents on a daily basis.

> Separately, all Singapore residents and long-term pass holders returning from overseas apart from Hubei province must serve the 14-day stay-home notice, while those returning from Hubei must serve a 14-day quarantine.

> All short-term visitors are barred from entering or transiting via Singapore.

> Last Monday, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Heng Swee Keat announced an additional $5.1 billion Solidarity Budget to help businesses, workers and households.

> The government’s response to COVID-19 will total $59.9 billion, or about 12 per cent of Singapore’s gross domestic product.

> To date, there are close to 2.1 million COVID-19 cases globally – it took 83 days to reach the first million cases worldwide and just 14 days for the second million.

> Some 136,000 have died from the virus, with the US holding the record for the highest global death toll at over 28,000.

> At over 640,000 cases, the country also holds the record of having the largest number of patients globally, followed by Spain at over 182,000 cases, Italy at over 165,000, and France at over 147,000.

> China, where the virus originated, has reported over 82,000 cases and more than 3,300 deaths.

"> # 17 maids here have Covid-19, none infected by foreign workers in dorms

> Only 17 foreign domestic workers (FDWs) here have been confirmed with Covid-19 so far, and they did not get it from foreign workers.

> Most of them were infected by their employers, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said in response to The New Paper's queries on Sunday .

> Among the 17, Cases 102, 104 and 108 were linked to the Wizlearn Technologies cluster.

> All three had employers who were either employees of Wizlearn Technologies or were linked to employees.

> Another infected FDW was Case 21, a 44-year-old Indonesian. Her employer, Case 19, worked at the Yong Thai Hang health products shop, which was one of the earliest clusters. The cluster has since been closed.

> With the number of infections among foreign workers living in dormitories shooting up, there has been speculation that maids may have come into contact with infected foreign workers on their rest days.

> A WhatsApp message claimed that the situation could ""very quickly spiral out of control"" if maids met infected workers and carried the virus back to their employers.

> Addressing these concerns in an interview with Lianhe Zaobao last Friday, Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam said: ""First of all, now (FDWs) can't go out, and second, when you drill down on the data, the rate of infection among foreign domestic workers is very low.

> ""The evidence we have so far is that they get the infection from their employers, not from outside.""

> STAY HOME

> On April 11, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said all maids must stay home on their rest days, except to buy meals or run essential errands.

> Mr William Lau, general manager of employment agency Maid Avenue, was not surprised by the low rate of infection among maids.

> He said: ""Even before the circuit breaker started, many FDWs were already staying at home and minimising contact with outsiders.

> ""Adding to that, MOM's recent announcement sent a very strong message to FDWs - it is no longer just an instruction from their employers.""

> A spokesman for the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (Home) said of the WhatsApp message: ""Perpetuating such messages targets the migrant worker community unfairly as it is speculative.""

> The Home spokesman said employers should not be unduly worried about their maids being infected since all parties are subjected to the same circuit breaker measures.

> Ms Josephine Chia, 44, a mother of two children aged four and six, said that while employers have valid concerns about infections among FDWs, the WhatsApp message ""irresponsible fearmongering"".

> Ms Chia, who now accompanies her Filipina helper to remit money, said: ""Of course there is a basis for worry, but we should remain calm and logical about it, especially as the low number of infected FDWs provides some reassurance.""

"A circuit breaker is a soft lockdown, excluding essential workers, since most people are staying at home. Given the number of symptomatic cases over the last 2 weeks, I am inclined to think that the circuit breaker measures are working for the wider community (excluding worker dorms, which is a whole other story).

If you look at the [MOH situation report](-19/situation-report), the number of total cases outside of dorms has trended down since the start of the circuit breaker measures on April 7th.

I assume the testing criteria for local cases outside of dorms have not changed, and if anything, GPs and polyclinics are probably somewhat more vigilant about suspected COVID cases showing symptoms given the escalating situation in terms of total case counts.",,2020-04-20 16:13:29,reddit,circuit breaker soft lockdown excluding essential since people staying home given number symptomatic last 2 weeks inclined think circuit breaker measures working wider community excluding whole story look moh situation report situation report number total outside trended since start circuit breaker measures april 7th assume testing criteria local outside not changed anything gps polyclinics probably somewhat vigilant suspected showing symptoms given escalating situation terms total case counts

"A forum letter published in Chinese daily Lianhe Zaobao that links the COVID-19 outbreak in dormitories to the personal hygiene and living habits of foreign workers shows ""underlying racism"", Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam said.""I think the letter reveals some underlying racism ... Because it typecasts an entire group - several hundred thousand of them - as lacking in personal hygiene, on the basis of their background, because they all come from backward countries,"" he said in an interview with Lianhe Zaobao on Friday (Apr 17).Mr Shanmugam also said that the letter is xenophobic and deeply insensitive, and reflected a ""lack of understanding of why we have this transmission of COVID-19 amongst our foreign worker population"".Singapore has seen a spike in its number of COVID-19 cases in recent weeks, with the majority of new cases involving foreign workers from dormitories.On Friday, Singapore reported 623 new infections, of which 558 were linked to foreign worker dormitories.Kranji Lodge 1 on Saturday became the 13th foreign worker dormitory to be gazetted an isolation area, meaning residents will have to be quarantined in their rooms.To date, more than 3,200 of Singapore's 5,050 cases are attributed to foreign worker domitories.The forum letter, published on Apr 13, questioned if foreign workers were to be blamed for the rise in cases, pointing to their eating habits and alleged lack of personal hygiene.Mr Shanmugam, however, said that the number of cases at foreign worker dormitories were primarily due to communal living, pointing out that foreign workers live, work and cook together.""Personal habits are extremely important  washing of hands, keeping yourself clean are very important,"" he said.""But when you put people together, when they sleep in the same room, they cook together and they are in close proximity over a long period of time, of course there will be high levels of transmission.""Mr Shanmugam also acknowledged concerns over the living conditions in dormitories, saying that conditions in the newer dormitories were ""quite okay"", while standards in the older ones varied.""As (Manpower) Minister Josephine Teo has said, look, we will fix this up after COVID-19, and we will deal with the older dorms,"" he said.With foreign worker cases expected to continue rising amid aggressive testing, Mr Shanmugam said there is a need to educate people on the reasons.""The circulation is limited, they are in community isolation,"" he said.""The cross-infection from that person to the rest of the community, whether Singaporean or PR, or foreign worker, is extremely minimised through our isolation approaches.""Some people have also expressed concern that foreign domestic workers, because of potential interaction with foreign workers on their days off, could be another group at risk of being infected in large numbers.Current data shows that infection among foreign domestic workers is very low, said Mr Shanmugam.Foreign domestic workers have to comply with circuit breaker measures and must remain in their employers' homes on their rest days.""The evidence so far is that they get the infection from their employers, not from outside,"" he added.Looking at the bigger picture, Mr Shanmugam said Singaporeans have a duty to care for foreign workers and show them empathy, adding that the Government and community have moved to help them.Fifty-seven per cent of Singaporeans have been able to become professionals, managers, executives and technicians (PMET) because of foreign workers, he said.""They clean Singapore, they build our HDB flats, they build our buildings, they handle our waste management, they form the base of our economy,"" he added.""And therefore they are helping us build our prosperity.""Mr Shanmugam cautioned Singaporeans against making sweeping statements about foreign workers, even as he acknowledged that racial fault lines run deep.""As Singaporeans, I would say, whether Chinese, Indian or Malay, or Eurasians, others, we are really kind, compassionate, generous people,"" he stated.""We are bigger than the sentiments expressed in that letter.""-12654924",,2020-04-18 12:32:00,hardwarezone,forum letter published chinese daily lianhe zaobao links

"For your first point, when it comes to ""one month > two month"", I don't think anyone can expect the govt to really know the future and provide a proper timeframe. Regardless of whether they choose to use ""circuit breaker"" vs ""lockdown"", I think the govt in this case should not be at fault for not knowing how long the lockdown period should be. 

On the other hand, we should instead fault them if there was mismanagement that led to the lengthening of the lockdown period.

Yes, it would be bad for retailers, etc. Many people's livelihoods are affected. However, this sounds more like making COVID-19 a reason to blame the govt instead. It's not like the govt has directly made these people suffer. Has the govt changed any policies that contributed to these people suffering? If so, then that would be another possible discussion.

"There are a few possible reasons for this.The main one, is hospital capacity. As they've already indicated, most people will recover with only mild or no symptoms. Once you test everyone, you will need to isolate and treat them.In other words, it can be seen as a slower way to build herd immunity, and only addressing those who develop serious complications. ""CB""s are required when the spread is anticipated to exceed hospital capacity for serious cases.This would then allow the economy to hobble along, without coming to a grinding halt and falling though the floor.As for the dorms, it can be seen as a controlled environment.

"""Migrant workers are viewed only as digits on a spreadsheet of menial labour, to be deployed as resources when necessary and kept out of sight when not.""She added that conditions at dorms have varied, with workers reporting hot and stuffy rooms and issues with food quality and quantity, some of whom were Bangladeshis fasting during Ramadan.Mr Mirpuri said the government cares for the welfare of migrant workers, giving free treatment to workers who show symptoms ""just like everyone else"".Meals and internet access are catered for workers being quarantined at the dorms, and during Ramadan, Muslim workers got their meals before dawn so that they could perform their religious practices, he said.Support is also given to employers so workers can continue to get paid and arrangements have been made for workers to remit money to their families.Mr Mirpuri said 3,000 public officers have been deployed to support dormitory operators and employers, and many Singaporeans have volunteered time, effort and money to complement the government's efforts.Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has also publicly committed to caring for migrant workers like Singaporeans, he added. ""The scope and scale of our efforts reflects the responsibility we feel for our migrant workers,"" he said.MANY CHOOSE TO CONTINUE WORKING IN SINGAPOREIn her piece, Ms Han said the fact that about 20 dorm operators and an average of 1,200 employers are penalised yearly for flouting licensing laws suggested substandard living conditions are a long-standing problem that has not been effectively addressed.She noted that rights groups had urged the government to address issues of overcrowding and sanitation even before the pandemic hit the dorms, but the concerns were brushed off.""Now that activists have been proved right in the most miserable way, Singapore still struggles with seeing migrant workers as equally valuable members of the community,"" she wrote.In his response, Mr Mirpuri said any approach to migrant worker welfare must take into account practical realities like Singapore's ageing society, small indigenous workforce, and lack of a hinterland to draw additional workers from.Housing migrant workers in land scarce Singapore can never be straightforward, he said.The government decided to meet this challenge with dorms built to specified standards, which have been progressively raised, with laws passed in 2015 requiring large dorms to have recreational and health facilities, and some amenities.While dorms allow workers to socialise and relax together, any communal living space comes with risks in an infectious outbreak, he added.Recognising the risks, the government in January told dorm operators to take several precautions, more stringent than those for the general population. When cases grew sharply despite the measures, a massive effort was mobilised to take care of workers, he said.Ms Han had also said that the current posture toward migrant workers will hamper efforts for systemic change after the pandemic, and places them in an even more vulnerable position in society.Already stigmatised as dirty or threats to public order, they are now also blamed by some for the spike in Covid-19 cases or berated for not being grateful enough, she added.Mr Mirpuri acknowledged that the government's response has not been perfect. ""There certainly are areas we can improve. We are determined to learn from this episode and will do a thorough review after the crisis is over.""He added that some migrant workers have been in Singapore for as long as 20 years.""They have chosen to continue to live and work in Singapore, rather than go elsewhere or return to work in their home countries,"" he said.""Their revealed preference shows the reality of the migrant worker experience in Singapore.

"Cut back on the back-patting: Singapores coronavirus response loses its shine as critics speak outPrime Minister Lee Hsien Loongs government faces escalating criticism over a surge of infections at foreign worker dormitoriesMeanwhile, many citizens seem to be flouting tough circuit breaker measures aimed at containing a resurgence in community transmissionsBhavan JaipragasPublished: 9:26pm, 10 Apr, 2020A telecast of Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong addressing the nation regarding the coronavirus. Photo: ReutersSingapore, for months hailed at home and overseas as the gold standard for responding to the Covid-19 pandemic, on Friday moved to defuse escalating criticism over how it has handled a surge in infections within foreign worker dormitories that activists had earlier flagged as public health risks due to their cramped conditions.Also weighing heavily on Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loongs government were signs that a sizeable number of locals were not obeying tough circuit breaker measures  essentially a partial lockdown  that have been in place since Tuesday to contain a resurgence in community transmissions after initial successes in containing the outbreak.Lee, in a recorded video message on Facebook, said military medical and logistics staff had been deployed to the city states 43 foreign worker dormitories. The facilities house some 200,000 work-permit holders  many from South Asia  who are employed in the construction, marine and other low-wage sectors shunned by Singaporeans.Singapore migrant workers under quarantine as coronavirus hits dormitoriesLee said Teo Chee Hean  the senior minister in charge of security affairs and a long-time trusted confidante of the prime minister  had been instructed to oversee a new task force responsible for ensuring the migrant workers were cared for.The multi-agency task force is helmed by the commander of the armys Guards Unit  an elite rapid deployment formation.We are paying close attention to the welfare of foreign workers, Lee said in the nearly 10-minute message. The task force would ensure that workers had food and water, and Wi-fi to keep in touch with families and friends, Lee said.We have worked with their employers to make sure they will be paid their salaries, and can remit money home. We will provide them with the medical care and treatment they need.Separately, he urged the countrys elderly citizens to abide by the lockdown measures. Officials have warned they may step up enforcement and penalties amid reports that residents  a majority of whom are seniors  continue to mingle and gather in public places.Our chances of dying are much higher, and if we get infected and spread the virus to our friends around our age, or bring the virus back home to our families, then we put them in grave danger, the 68-year-old prime minister said, directly addressing older Singaporeans.Lees address to the nation  exactly a week after he announced the partial lockdown measures that began this week  came as local commentators became more vocal in criticising how migrant workers were being cared for.When he spoke last week, the plaudits were still flowing in.But since then the number of confirmed infections has risen to double that of Hong Kong, with the national tally on Friday standing at 2,108  a nearly threefold increase over two weeks.Many of the new cases are linked to clusters in the foreign worker dormitories.Five dormitories are now on a total lockdown  residents are expected to spend most of their time in their rooms  while the residents of the remaining accommodation are barred from leaving the premises.Those measures are more severe than the circuit breaker measures faced by the bulk of the city states residents, who are allowed to leave their homes to purchase food or exercise in isolation.Exacerbating the pressure on the government were media reports and accounts by activists about the conditions in one of the dormitories put on total lockdown. The Straits Times reported on Monday, based on residents accounts, that urinals in toilets were overflowing and that the kitchen had a cockroach infestation.A construction worker from the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu currently living in that dormitory told ﻿This Week in Asia conditions  including cleanliness in common areas and the quality of food served  had improved significantly in the days after the report.Most of us are now worried about two things: how long will this last because its very boring to be shut in for a long time, and what happens to our jobs when this ends? he said in Tamil, requesting anonymity as he believed his employer  a mid-sized construction firm  would disapprove of him speaking to the media. He said he spent his time singing to himself and posting video messages to his followers on the social media app TikTok.Another worker, 36-year-old Arun Singaram, a resident at the North Coast Lodge in the city states northern Woodlands district, said he had been using hand sanitisers and disinfectants regularly as the rising number of reports of migrant workers being sickened by Covid-19 worried him.While he was confident of maintaining hygiene standards inside his 12-person room, he said he was concerned about venturing into the toilet and kitchen.Officials have stressed that they have all hands on deck dealing with the fast evolving situation at the dormitories, and the Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on Monday issued a statement urging critics not to demoralise her staff.That had little effect in containing criticism from some of the countrys independent political commentators  many of whom had earlier credited the government for its fastidious approach in dealing with the crisis.In a commentary on Friday, the former newspaper editor P.N Balji questioned if the uptick in infection could have been avoided had alarm bells rung when five workers were infected in February.How quickly fortunes can turn. It was only a few weeks ago that Singapore was smelling like roses with the country being praised, both here and abroad, for its efficient handling of the Covid-19 crisis, wrote the one-time editor of the countrys ﻿Today newspaper. Today, the same government is struggling to contain the quick spread of the virus as dormitories for migrant workers open up a new battlefront.A general view of Westlite Dormitory, one of the worker dormitories gazetted as isolation areas to curb the spread of the coronavirus in Singapore. Photo: ReutersOthers wondered if a March 23 warning by local migrant workers rights group TWC2 had gone unheeded. The group, in a forum letter to The Straits Times, had urged the government to make public its contingency plans for mass infections in dormitories in advance.It cited how the risk of new clusters among foreign workers was undeniable because foreign workers are housed 12 to 20 men per room in double-decker beds [and they] are transported to work on the back of lorries sitting shoulder to shoulder.Then and now: Asia-Pacific landmarks emptied by the coronavirus pandemicSudhir Thomas Vadaketh, a local author, suggested in an op-ed piece that the risk had been overlooked because Singaporeans were preoccupied in self-praise over the governments efforts to quarantine residents returning from abroad in posh hotels at the taxpayers expense.With many basking in Singaporean pride and glory, societys gaze may have been diverted, Sudhir wrote on the ﻿New Naratif website. Little, if anything, has been done to address TWC2s concerns over the past two weeks.What can Singapore do to ensure that nobody else falls through the cracks? First, cut back on the back-patting and self-praise, and instead approach our problems with more humility and self-awareness.The welfare of Singapores low-wage migrant workers has long been a subject of controversy, although it only sporadically emerges as a subject of widespread national debate. The last time it happened was in 2013, following a riot triggered by the death of an Indian worker in a road accident.Public anger over the last week has manifested in an outpouring of donations for the workers, with an effort helmed by local social media personality Preeti Nair raising over S$215,000 (US$151,000) within 48 hours. A online petition for the government to do more to secure the rights of the workers has meanwhile obtained some 18,000 signatures.Of Singapores population of 5.7 million people, some 1.4 million people are non-residents.The city state had 284,300 foreign construction workers and 255,800 foreign domestic helpers as of June 2019, according to official data.Zhup:

Those foreign workers were then turned away from the hospital after news were released.As the employers and the foreign workers were worried that their work pass and licence to hire foreign worker may be revoked by MOM, everyone remained quiet till the massive outbreak happened.The PAP Taskforce tried to cover up their earlier mishap but it got too big to sweep it under the carpet.

> The virus prevalence rates for work permit holders not living in dorms remains constant at 1.09 per cent, or 577 people diagnosed out of 664,000 of these work permit holders. That for Singaporeans, permanent residents and other pass holders is 1.03 per cent, or 1,229 of about 4.7 million here.

> On Monday, MOH said the number of new cases, excluding work permit holders staying inside or outside dorms, has decreased from an average of 20 cases a day two weeks ago to nine in the past week.

> The number of unlinked cases in this group has also fallen from a daily average of 12 cases two weeks ago to four in the past week.

"SINGAPORE — Foreign workers have been in the authorities’ sight early on in the COVID-19 outbreak in Singapore at the start of the year, said Manpower Minister Josephine Teo on Monday (4 May).Delivering a ministerial statement in Parliament, she explained how the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) helped to prevent imported cases by limiting the return of work pass holders and monitoring returnees’ compliance with Leaves of Absence and Stay-Home Notices, among other things.“Throughout this period, migrant workers were also on our radar,” said Teo.“Back in January, soon after the multi-ministry task force was set up, MOM reached out to dormitory operators to be more vigilant and to step up hygiene. In fact, one of the earliest media conferences that Minister Lawrence Wong and I held was at the Tuas View Dormitory, after we inspected their quarantine facilities in early February,” she said.Wong helms the National Development Ministry and co-chairs the Multi-Ministry Taskforce tackling the spread of the virus.Teo added, “We produced materials in the workers’ native languages to encourage them to take steps to protect themselves. Subsequently, non-essential facilities in the dormitories like gyms and TV rooms were closed. Meal-times and recreational hours were staggered. Intermixing between blocks was stopped.“MOM officers also fanned out on weekends, to advise migrant workers to observe safe distancing measures and disperse big groups that were gathering at popular hangouts.”‘Narrow focus on rooming arrangements may not prevent recurrence’In February, the authorities detected the first COVID-19 cluster involving migrant workers at a construction site at Seletar Aerospace Heights. The five workers stayed at five different locations, only two of which were dormitories, Teo noted.“Thereafter, there was no indication of higher prevalence of COVID-19 among migrant workers, compared to the general community,” she said.Several MPs had raised queries on the outbreak of COVID-19 in dormitories. Jurong GRC MP Ang Wei Neng asked, among other things, about the lessons to be drawn from the management of dormitories and if safe distancing can be “practically practised” in the existing purpose-built dormitories.Meanwhile, Nee Soon GRC MP Louis Ng asked if MOM would consider raising the minimum gross floor area of 4.5 square metres for each resident in a foreign workers' dormitory; and not including the basic living facilities - such as living quarters, kitchen, dining, and toilet areas - in the computation for the minimum gross floor area.Nominated MPs Walter Theseira and Anthea Ong also asked if a Committee of Inquiry would be appointed to probe the COVID-19 outbreak in the dormitories.Responding, Teo said epidemiological findings show that within the dormitories which have clusters, not all blocks or rooms are equally affected. And across the different dormitories, infected workers were linked via common work sites.“At the work sites, it was not uncommon for the infected workers to take breaks together, share food and utensils. Likewise, infected workers from different dormitories had gathered during their rest days to socialise and shop, for example at Mustafa. Back in the dormitories, workers spent time with their friends, cooking, eating and relaxing together,” said Teo.“The virus may have spread through all of these activities, much like how it spread among family members, religious groups and even colleagues,” she added.Teo also noted that most infected workers showed mild symptoms of the virus and that many cases were uncovered only due to active case-finding or swab-taking.“This may explain why up to the middle of March, the cases of workers at the dormitories testing positive were few and far between. Once evidence emerged that the virus had spread in the dormitories, we decided to deal with it squarely and quickly, and mobilise whole-of-government resources,” the minister said.She added, “Multiple channels of transmission among migrant workers, as appear to be the case, also means that we need a multi-faceted approach to dealing with the outbreak. A narrow focus on rooming arrangements may not prevent a recurrence. This consideration underpins the comprehensive approach of the Taskforce.”-19-m...083406682.htmlwhy never built a separation dom in feb and wait till apr?everything last min",,2020-04-05 17:12:00,hardwarezone,singapore authorities sight early outbreak singapore start year said manpower minister josephine teo monday 4 may delivering ministerial statement parliament explained ministry manpower mom helped prevent imported limiting return work pass holders monitoring returnees compliance leaves absence stay home notices among things throughout period also radar said teo back january soon multi ministry task force set mom reached operators vigilant step hygiene fact one earliest media conferences minister lawrence wong held tuas view inspected quarantine facilities early february said wong helms national development ministry co chairs multi ministry taskforce tackling spread teo added produced materials native languages encourage take steps protect subsequently non essential facilities like gyms tv rooms closed meal times recreational hours staggered intermixing blocks stopped mom officers also fanned weekends advise observe safe distancing measures disperse big groups gathering popular hangouts narrow focus rooming arrangements may not prevent recurrence february authorities detected first cluster involving construction site seletar aerospace heights five stayed five different locations two teo noted thereafter no indication higher prevalence among compared general community said several mps raised queries outbreak jurong grc mp ang wei neng asked among things lessons drawn management safe distancing practically practised existing purpose built meanwhile nee soon grc mp louis ng asked mom would consider raising minimum gross floor area 4 5 square metres resident not including basic living facilities living quarters kitchen dining toilet areas computation minimum gross floor area nominated mps walter theseira anthea ong also asked committee inquiry would appointed probe outbreak responding teo said epidemiological findings show within clusters not blocks rooms equally affected across different infected linked via common work sites work sites not uncommon infected take breaks together share food utensils likewise infected different gathered rest days socialise shop example mustafa back spent time friends cooking eating relaxing together said teo may spread activities much like spread among family members religious groups even colleagues added teo also noted infected showed mild symptoms many uncovered due active case finding swab taking may explain middle march testing positive far evidence emerged spread decided deal squarely quickly mobilise whole government resources minister said added multiple channels transmission among appear case also means need multi faceted approach dealing outbreak narrow focus rooming arrangements may not prevent recurrence consideration underpins comprehensive approach taskforce 083406682 htmlwhy never built separation dom feb wait till apr everything last min

"Hmm. Wont say its fake lah. Its just the standard. All other countries are doing the same on this as well including Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea etc. Only when you are sick and do not recover, then do you see the doctor again to do a swab test. The 5 day MC is just a delayed response, it does not increase the numbers but bring it to 5-7 days later only if you do not recover. Based on 3000 test capability for Singapore now, this is unreasonable as most persons with the same kind of symptoms as COVID-19 could number at least 30,000 daily. Tests can be ordered at most GPs and polyclinics now already, so if you feel strongly you need a test, you can just inform the doctor. My thinking is better not unless you dont recover. Actually ok wan, then you are waiting and queuing with somebody with COVID, you touch the desk of the nurse whos administering the swab test for you, after that you go home take out mask, accidentally touch your face etc. So better not. A 5-day delay is reasonable to filter out this virus. It is unlikely that you will not recover from a sore throat if you on antibiotics like Augmentin or Klacid for example.
